      "label": "Struggle free, healthy and practical recipes that are easy on the wallet. It’s as simple as that, and it’s a message that’s seen over 1 million people follow FitMenCook on social media.\n\nBe honest, have you ever heard these complaints about healthy eating?\n\n- “Eating healthy is too expensive!”\n- “It takes too long! I don’t have hours to spend in the kitchen.”\n- “Healthy food is too bland”\n- “I always end up cheating and slipping back in to bad habits”\n\nKevin Curry, founder of FitMenCook, has been there. After spotting a picture of himself on a friend’s Facebook wall he knew it was time for a change.\n\nHe followed all the common advice, changed to a healthy diet and started hitting the gym.\n\nFor a few months, things were great, but after a while he found himself craving the old foods he was trying so hard to avoid.\n\nHe got his hands on every book he could find on nutrition and started experimenting in the kitchen.\n\nHis aims were simple:\n\nA) Food should be easy to prepare and affordable\nB) Food should be vibrant and tasty, never boring\nC) Preparing food in advance is important\nD) Following a, b, c helps you achieve your fitness goals\n\nThe results for Kevin were game change and now he’s spreading message to the FitMenCook community on social media and inside the FMC app.\n\nTop 5 features:\n\n#1\nSHOPPING CART + APPLE WATCH\n\nWe've taken the hassle out of grocery shopping. Add any recipes you want to your shopping list and we'll organise the list by aisle, so you can easily find the items you need.\n\nThe shopping list also works on the Apple Watch.\n\n#2\nEASY STEP BY STEP VIDEO INSTRUCTIONS\n\nIf you’ve ever looked at recipe instructions and thought “this just looks too difficult for me” then you’ll find the included recipe videos very helpful. Not only is Kevin a great host, who’ll fill you with inspiration for healthy meals, but he’ll also break down the steps in a way that’s easy to follow.\n\n#3\nFOCUS ON MEAL PREP\n\nBuying ingredients in small quantities can make recipes more expensive. Not only that, but many of us don’t have time every day to spend in the kitchen.\n\nMeal prep is the solution. By designating two days of the week as your main cooking days, you can prepare your meals in bulk and eat healthy all week.\n\nThis is a crucial part of the app, and many of the meals are designed with meal preparation in mind, to make healthy living fit with a busy life.\n\n#4\nMACRO COUNTING AND INTEGRATION WITH APPLE HEALTH APP\n\nBodybuilders and fat-loss superheroes can rejoice as the FitMenCook app has nutritional information built right in! Recipes list calories, protein, carbs and fat. This data can then be shared with the Apple Health app.\n\n5#\nSCALE UP A RECIPE\n\nIncrease the serving sizes by tapping the + and - buttons in the recipe view. You can also switch the measurements between metric and imperial.\n\nThere’s more including:\n- 750+ recipes with more added each month\n- Search by ingredient: Type in Egg Avocado to see all recipes containing both of these ingredients\n- Share recipes with friends and family\n- Available in English and Spanish\n\nFor a video demonstration of the app in action, take a look at: http://fitmencook.com/app/\n\nOptional Meal Planner Subscription:\nFitMenCook Pro is available as a monthly (0.99 USD) or yearly (5.99 USD) subscription.

We'd love to help you get cooking!***\n\n#1 Food & Drink App and featured as one of Apple's \"Best New Apps\"!\n\nIt’s the Webby Award-winning app from Michelle Tam and Henry Fong, the James Beard Award nominated creators of Nom Nom Paleo—now available for both iPad and iPhone! Michelle and Henry’s Saveur Award winning food blog and New York Times bestselling cookbook are just the tip of the iceberg—this newly updated app makes cooking even more fun and inspirational, and takes all the guesswork out of cooking. Plus, now that the Nom Nom Paleo app’s available for iPhone, you can take these nomtastic recipes with you anywhere!\n\nFeatures:\n \n● Over 145 simple, tantalizing recipes, all free of gluten, soy, and refined sugar, sortable by food category, searchable by ingredients and category—the vast majority of which are approved for the Whole30® nutritional re-set program. You’ll find lots of recipes that are exclusive to this app, and not available on the Nom Nom Paleo website or cookbook. \n\n● More recipes are being added regularly! You won’t have to wait until future app updates—new recipes can now be added automatically to the app on your device!\n\n● More than 2,000 stunning, high-resolution photos showing every step of the cooking process.\n\n● Fun and visually-engaging new user interface and design, including a home display that allows you to quickly scroll through and visually select recipes.\n\n● Simple-to-follow instructions, including tips, shortcuts, and information about food and techniques.\n\n● An interactive, email-friendly grocery list that syncs across devices and makes food shopping a breeze.\n\n● An extensive “Paleo 101” primer that explains the benefits of the “caveman” diet and provides resources for more information about ancestral health and nutrition.\n\n● A Whole30-friendly 30-day sample meal plan with links to recipes.\n\n● An in-depth shopping guide with product reviews and links to sources for cooking tools and ingredients.\n\n● The ability to bookmark recipes, create a personalized category of favorite recipes, and add notes.\n\n● A “constant-on” function to prevent the screen from dimming while you cook.\n  \n● The ability to email complete recipes and shopping lists.\n\nPraise for Nom Nom Paleo:\n\n● The “Martha Stewart of Paleo.” –The New York Times\n\n● “Oddly provocative.” –Christopher Kimball of America’s Test Kitchen\n\n● “A must-have app.” –AppCraver\n\n● “Brilliantly designed.” –Apps Magazine\n \n● “Visually stunning.” –Gear Diary\n\n● “Always popping with flavor.” –The Kitchn\n\n● “Truly extraordinary.” –Michael Ruhlman, James Beard Award-winning food writer\n \nMessage from Michelle of Nom Nom Paleo:\n\nHey, Nomsters – my updated cookbook app is here, and it’s finally available for your iPhone!\n\nThis “cookbook on steroids” is a uniquely immersive culinary experience. It’s a visual feast packed with brand new recipes, as well as updated versions of classic Nom Nom Paleo dishes—all presented with my own special brand of whimsically snarky commentary. Food lovers and busy home cooks can visually follow each of my recipes from the pantry to the dining room table.\n \nBut that’s not all! For those who want to learn more about the “caveman” approach to nutrition and health, I’ve included a “Paleo 101” primer that explains why we eat whole, unprocessed, real foods (like meat, seafood, vegetables, fruits, and nuts) and avoid highly-processed and pro-inflammatory foods. You’ll also find an in-depth shopping guide, a 30-day meal planner, an interactive shopping list, and much, much more.\n \nMy hope is that this app will delight, engage, and inspire you to eat well and be well!\n \n● App development by Y Media Labs ●"

Or are you looking for inventive ways to provide nutritious meals to your fussy eater?\n\nThe Fussy Toddler app includes a wide range of quick and easy recipes designed specifically for fussy eaters! The meals include a selection of breakfast, lunch, dinner and snack ideas, with nourishing, enjoyable uses of fruit and vegetables.\n\nWhy I created this app:\n\nEvery toddler goes through phases, particularly when it comes to food. Fussy eaters are notoriously difficult to cater for, especially when it comes to fruit and vegetables.\n\nMy daughter Annabelle has been through her fair share of fussy phases and, at times, still does. This app is my extension from the Baby-Led Weaning recipes I created in the early days of our food-journey; it builds on these by putting health, variety and excitement at the heart of each recipe to keep my fussy eater, and yours, interested by every meal.\n\nI know that when you’re a busy parent or carer, time spent working in the kitchen can seem like the last thing you want to do. That’s why I have created easy-to-prepare, delicious recipes that even the fussiest of eaters should devour in no time! How do I know? Because my own fussy eater, Annabelle, has taste-tested each of these recipes for you.\n\nIf you’re struggling to provide your child with healthy meals, then this app will provide you with tasty recipes to do so, whilst ensuring that they eat a varied balanced diet.\n\nKey App Features:\n\n* Over 110 delicious family recipes designed specifically for fussy eaters\n* A clean, bright design that is easy to navigate\n* Recipes divided into clear breakfast, lunch, dinner and snack sections\n* Search for your favourite family recipes by recipe name and ingredient\n* Add recipe ingredients directly into your shopping basket\n* Save your favourites so they are easily located in one place\n* Free help and support via the online support group (linked in the app)\n* Free app updates and improvements\n\nPlease feel free to contact me if you have a question or require any support; I am always happy to help.\n\nNatalie x"

Reactions to various \"natural\" compounds in foods can often create an array of health problems in individuals, from the GI tract to skin issues to neurological and hormonal imbalances.

This app is a must-have for any food sensitive individual to have with them when shopping at the supermarket or eating out.\" \n\n- Dr. Vincent Pedre, Bestselling Author of \"Happy Gut\"\n\n\n\"Whether you know your current food sensitivities or are trying to figure them out, Food Sense Guide will help you take charge of your food choices for peaceful eating, to support resilient health!\"\n\n- Ariane Resnick, CNC, Celebrity Chef and Bestselling Author of \"The Bone Broth Miracle\" and \"How to be Well When You’re Not\"\n\n\n\nDeveloper’s Note: Food Sense is intended to provide general amounts (in ranges of low, medium, and high) for the compounds found in various foods, as referenced in multiple studies and accredited sources.

      "label": "**UPDATED PRICE: NOW ONLY $4.99 FOR A LIMITED TIME! **\n\nEnjoy all of the great content from The Oxford Companion to Beer in this reference app, which includes popular terms, search, daily definitions, and more.\n\nThe Oxford Companion to Beer book won 1st Place Winner of the 2012 Gourmand Award for Best in the World in the Beer category.\n\nFor millennia, beer has been a favorite beverage in cultures across the globe. After water and tea, it is the most popular drink in the world, and it is at the center of a $450 billion industry. \n\nEdited by Garrett Oliver, the James Beard Winner for Outstanding Wine, Beer, or Spirits Professional, this is the first major reference work to investigate the history and vast scope of beer. The Oxford Companion to Beer features more than 1,100 A-Z entries written by 166 of the world's most prominent beer experts. Attractively illustrated with over 140 images, the book covers everything from the agricultural makeup of various beers to the technical elements of the brewing process, local effects of brewing on regions around the world, and the social and political implications of sharing a beer. Entries not only define terms such as \"dry hopping\" and \"cask conditioning\" but give fascinating details about how these and other techniques affect a beer's taste, texture, and popularity. Cultural entries shed light on such topics as pub games, food pairings and the development of beer styles. Readers will enjoy vivid accounts of how our drinking traditions have changed throughout history, and how these traditions vary in different parts of the world, from Japan to Mexico, New Zealand, and Brazil, among many other countries. The pioneers of beer-making are the subjects of biographical entries, and the legacies these pioneers have left behind, in the form of the world's most popular beers and breweries, are recurrent themes throughout the book."

Then you probably own a circulator or a similar device. To start, a zip-bag, a cooking pot and a thermometer is all you need. Many Sous Vide recipes work without special equipment. But you will need good advice!\n\nSous Vide has been adopted in professional kitchens for producing precise and consistent results. The Sous Vide method produces perfectly cooked food with outstanding flavor. Its success in high-end cuisine changed the culinary world. With a few starting tips anyone can use this technique. Step-by-step tutorials and Sous Vide timers (mini-recipes with an alarm) help you along the way.\n\nIdeas, suggestions or anything you would like to change? Contact us with your feedback on UserVoice!\n\nThe time for a piece of meat to reach a core temperature can be calculated. A formula using thermal diffusivity, thermal conductivity and surface heat transfer calculates the time such shapes as cylinders, cubes and steaks need to acquire a certain core temperature. Consider the PolyScience Toolbox App or Douglas Baldwin’s formulas for calculating pasteurization times.\n\nBut food is never an exact geometrical shape and waiting for an extra hour for a piece to reach an additional half a degree is impractical. Adjustments for speed and efficiency improve the Sous Vide experience. We have tested Sous Vide recommendations that work and tutorials that make the first steps easy - for professionals and home cooks alike!\n\nSous Vide - no other cooking method gives you so much control!\n\nDon’t get the Anova Pro or the new Anova Precision Cooker (2019) as these devices are no longer equipped with Bluetooth!"

      "label": "How many of us struggle with \"kitchen math?\" The Kitchen Calculator PRO app makes cooking and measuring so much easier. Kitchen Calculator PRO does all the recipe conversions for you, and makes it simple to scale recipes up (or down) to change the number of servings the recipe yields. With Kitchen Calculator PRO you can:\n\n1.Quickly scale your recipes (add, subtract, multiply, divide) using fractions!\n\n2.Convert ingredients from weight to volume, and vice versa ( cups to grams, ounces,  etc. )\n\n3.Supports several volume, weight, distance, and temperature conversions\n\n4.Enter amounts and view results in standard cooking fractions (1/2, 1/3, etc )\n\n5.Grow a database with your favorite ingredients! (see weight to volume )\n\n\nUSER COMMENTS\n\n***** Exactly what I've been looking for! - \"I just tested this out on a new cake recipe and it was simple, easy and accurate. The cake came out *perfect*!\" by njanehair.\n\n***** Yippee, perfection! - \"I cook 3 meals a day for my toddler and am always needing to scale recipes down so I'm not making ridiculous amounts of food\" by Cindi M.\n\n***** Brilliant - \"For a cook trained in the metric system, this tool is a dream come true\" by BeeDiana.\n\n\nSCALE YOUR RECIPES\n\nEasily convert and scale recipes in an instant. Doubling a recipe (or cutting a recipe in half) is simpler than ever before, with all the most common units of cooking measurement right at your fingertips. \n\n\nWEIGHT TO VOLUME CONVERSIONS\n\nWhat is so special about weight to volume conversions?\n\nWhen converting from weight to volume it is important to take into account the ingredient you are converting. As you know, a cup of sugar does not weigh the same as a cup of rice. Furthermore, a particular brand of sugar may weigh different from another.  This is all made easy with Kitchen Calculator PRO.\n\nSo, how does Kitchen Calculator handle weight to volume conversions?\n\n1.It comes with a database of common ingredients based on weight figures from the USDA (US Department of Agriculture).\n\n2.It allows you to quickly enter and save your own ingredient weight for more precise conversions.  In many cases, you can enter the values right off the product label, using fractions!  \n\n3.Kitchen Calculator will remember any saved ingredient information for future conversions.\n\nNOTE: The preset ingredient list is based on USDA  (US Department of Agriculture) figures and are approximate values. They may differ from the ingredients you use.

In BLW (Baby Led Weaning) you don't put spoons, or pieces of food in your baby’s mouth. You simply offer your baby food, and he eats what he wants.\n\nBaby-led weaning allows babies to control their solid food consumption by \"self-feeding\" from the very beginning of their experiences with food. Baby-led weaning places the emphasis on exploring taste, texture, color and smells as the baby sets their own pace for the meal, and chooses which foods to concentrate on. Instead of spooning food into your baby's mouth, you present him or her with varied finger foods from which to choose and he or she chooses what to eat and how much. If she doesn't touch the oatmeal balls you made for her you do not put them in her mouth, you just offer them to her again at another meal."

      "label": "Use Fromage as your guide to worldwide cheeses, the #1 app preferred by cheese lovers.  Fromage provides a convenient pocket resource of fantastic cheeses made throughout the world for your culinary exploration.  The cheese library contains well beyond 1,600 world cheeses from over 35 countries and is continuously expanded thanks to suggestions from our established base of Fromage users worldwide.\n\nEach cheese entry features artistically presented cheese photos, historically narrated flavor descriptions, website links to the producer’s dairy or fromager, and suggested best choices for complementary wines.  You can add your own favorite cheeses to the standard library and include personal notes about any of the cheeses.\n\nSearching within the library for that special cheese can be by name, country, milk-type, texture, or by your own custom tags (such as #atmystore).\n\nSo, if you’re a classically trained chef, professional party planner, cheese buyer, or just plain cheese lover, grab Fromage, your favorite wine, and experience the wonderful and historic flavors of cheese.\n_________________________________\n\nFromage comes with the ability to create personal cheese notes, rate cheeses from 1 to 5 stars (included an “Avoid” rating), add cheeses to your favorite lists (Try, Buy, or Favorites categories), record tasting impressions with up to 70 tasting keywords, and search the cheese library.\n\nYou can also enter your own cheeses (including photos captured from your device camera) and list those cheeses automatically in the “My Additions” category.  There is also a “Share” feature so cheese information can be sent (via e-mail) to friends or to the developer for inclusion in future versions of Fromage. \n_________________________________\n\nInternet or Wi-Fi connection is not required for program use, which is great for remote locations when no data plan is available.\n\nWhen internet is available, Fromage uses iCloud to synchronize your cheese entries and notes between all of your Apple devices which can include iPhone, iPad, and Macintosh.\n\nThe application provides English, French, Spanish, and German languages when the iOS device settings are set to that language."

You use a simple interface to plan out meals like “Hamburgers on Thursday, Fish and Rice on Friday”. Recent meals are easily available or you can type in new items the first time you use them.\n\nMealPlan is a universal app, and will sync between your iPhone and iPad using either iCloud or Dropbox. Plan your meals on the iPad's big screen, and automatically have your grocery list with you on your phone. And access your grocery list from your Apple Watch.\n\nMealPlan creates your grocery list as you're planning meals. When you're done, tap the Grocery Basket to see the list, add new items, mark off items you already have, and then print it, email it, or sync it with your iPhone. This is a huge time saver!\n\nAnd, on the iPad, once you’ve used the app for a few weeks, the Magic Wand will help you quickly fill out subsequent weeks, with a quick suggestions interface.\n\nFeatures include:\n- Simple interface to plan out meals.\n- Keep track of recipes and the groceries they use.\n- Automatically generated grocery list based on your meal plan.\n- Save grocery lists for later use (think \"Party\" or \"Camping\").\n- Save a week's planned meals as a template to reuse.\n- Combined search/add box makes it easy to add new items.\n- Print out a week's plan to any AirPrint printer.\n- Configure your own meals: Add snacks, or remove breakfast if you don't want to plan it.\n- Email a plain text summary of the week's plan.\n- Add a note to any meal item, including clickable links.\n- Dropbox sync for families with multiple devices and accounts.\n- Use Siri for groceries: \"Add Milk to my Grocery List\".\n\n\"Before MealPlan, I’d buy food at the grocery store and then forget I had it .. a few days later it would go to waste. A few minutes every week standing in front of the fridge with MealPlan in hand will help you get the most out of what you have on hand. Plan it, print it out and stick it to your fridge!\"\n\nVisit the website for more information, and a detailed walkthrough of what MealPlan can do."

The best-selling cookbook, Ratio: The Simple Codes Behind the Craft of Everyday Cooking, by me, Michael Ruhlman, is now an iPhone app that will help you calculate amounts of ingredients in all the fundamental culinary preparations.  When you know a ratio, you don’t know a recipe, you know 1,000.  And this application does all the calculating for you.\n\n “Cooking, like so many other creative endeavors is defined by relationships.  For instance, knowing exactly how much flour to put into a loaf of bread isn’t nearly as useful as understanding the relationship between the flour and the water, or fat, or salt.  That relationship is defined by a ‘ratio’ and having a ratio in hand is like having a secret decoder ring that frees you from the tyranny of recipes. ….Michael Ruhlman, in handing us mortals a power better suited to the gods, has changed the balance of kitchen power forever.” —Good Eats host Alton Brown\n\n\nWhat You Get:\n\n--THE 32 CRITICAL RATIOS that form the backbone of the culinary arts, with instructions: doughs, batters, meat preparations, custards, sauces (pasta dough and pizza dough, sponge cake and pancakes, fritters and crepes, stocks and sauces, crème caramel and chocolate sauce.\n\n--A CALCULATOR that figures out how much of each ingredient you need, no matter how many or how few people you want to serve.\n\n--An OUNCES-TO-GRAMS CONVERTER (ratios work no matter what unit you choose to use!).\n\n--DELICIOUS VARIATIONS FOR RECIPES on all the ratios, ideas for the creation of new dishes according to your tastes.\n\n--An easy way to STORE YOUR OWN RECIPES and notes that you’ve created from the basic ratios.\n\n--Quick fun ways to SHARE what your cooking with your fellow cooks, on Facebook and on Twitter.\n\n--Ratios is also a great way to understand and TWEAK YOUR OWN RECIPES, to help you make your pancakes even fluffier, your pizza dough crisper, your crème brulee richer."

      "label": "For restaurant owners, bake shops, caterers, manufacturers of food products, chefs, and even home cooks.  With Salt & Pepper, you can:\n\nCreate recipes with an ingredient list, procedure, yield, preparation time, notes, and photos/videos.  Choose your recipe ingredients from your dynamically-filtered master ingredient list, then select various preparations (such as \"finely-diced\" or \"sautéed\"), from a pick-list of over 40 options.\n\nEnter costs for each ingredient in your recipe, and Salt & Pepper will display the total cost of the recipe, and the cost per serving.  Set a recipe's selling price, and Salt & Pepper will calculate the mark-up and profit information.  You can also add \"other costs\" to your recipes, which can be a percentage of the total ingredient cost, or based on quantity, such as per serving, per batch, or per unit.\"\n\nUse the Suppliers screen to create, edit, and delete ingredients.  Changes made to an ingredient's name, price, allergens, food energy, density, or usable portion are applied to all recipes containing that ingredient.  You can organize your ingredients by supplier, and further by category.\n\nRecord your inventory, and set minimum values.  Salt & Pepper will calculate the monetary value of each stock item, and the total value of your entire inventory.\n\nScale your recipes up or down, or to a desired yield.  The amount and cost of each ingredient, and the total cost of the recipe, are adjusted accordingly.\n\nSeparate a recipe's ingredients into multiple sections, such as \"For the Cake\", \"For the Frosting\", and \"For the Ganache\".  Re-order your ingredients and preparation steps by dragging them.\n\nUse one recipe as an ingredient in another recipe.  When \"Recipe A\" is used as an ingredient in \"Recipe B\", the cost, allergens, and food energy of \"Recipe A\"  become part of \"Recipe B\" (based on the quantity used).\n\nDuplicate recipes, in order to experiment with multiple variations.\n\nTrack the expiration dates of your ingredients.  If you choose, Salt & Pepper will notify you before your ingredients expire.\n\nEnter densities for your ingredients.  Densities allow the calculation of a recipe's cost or calories when an ingredient is purchased by weight, but the recipe measurement is in volume.\n\nManage shopping lists.  You can add ingredients to your shopping lists directly from your recipes.  Quantities from multiple recipes are automatically summed.  You can arrange your store's aisles to match the physical stores at which you shop, and you can arrange your ingredients in the order that they appear on the actual store shelves. \n\nCreate notes, with checklists, photos/videos, and a due date (with alarm).\n\nCreate custom categories for filing your recipes and notes.  A recipe or note can belong to multiple categories.  For meal planning, custom recipe categories can serve as menus, such as \"Rehearsal Dinner Menu\".  You can also create \"outlets\" to further categorize items based on location.  For instance, if you operate a number of restaurants, you could create a separate outlet for each.  \n\nLink your recipes and notes to related recipes and notes.\n\nShare individual recipes, suppliers, shopping lists, and notes with co-workers, family, and friends.  When changes are made to a shared item, everyone receives the changes.   You can also set \"abilities\" for each user.  For instance, you can specify whether a particular user is allowed to view or edit ingredient costs.\n\nPrint your recipes, suppliers, shopping lists, and notes.\n\nE-mail recipes and notes.  You can send them in PDF format, and as Salt & Pepper data files, which the recipient can import into Salt & Pepper.\n\nUse the Conversions screen to convert units of weight, volume, and temperature, and to perform price comparisons.\n\nSync your recipes, suppliers, shopping lists, and notes between all of your iOS devices.\n\nSalt & Pepper contains no advertisements."

      "label": "RDA Planner is used to calculate the nutritional value of the foods you eat. This can be compared to the Recommended Daily Allowances to see if you are getting the nutrition you need. The app is divided into 4 main topics:\n\nDAILY - Keep track of the foods you eat each day. Tap Add Food to add a food to your daily total. This can be an individual food item or a meal that you have created that contains multiple food items.  The best way to add a food is by searching since there are over 5000 different foods you can add. They are also separated by categories if that is easier for you to choose from. Once a food is selected, choose the portion size. Add a cost to the food to see how much you spend and compare by measuring the cost per calorie for each day. Delete a food from your daily total by swiping left on the food item. To get a bigger picture of your daily foods, tap Planner. The planner shows your daily totals for each month. Tap a day to jump to that days totals, or long press on a day to delete all of the foods associated with it. To view more of the vitamins and nutrients consumed on a given day, tap \"View All\". This will show over 30 nutrients and how much you have consumed and compare to the recommended daily allowance. Tap a nutrient to see foods that contain it in high or low values. Also by tapping Info, a detailed description of that nutrient can be found.\n\nMEALS - You can combine multiple food items to make a meal. This will make it easier to add foods that you eat regularly. For example, if you commonly eat yogurt, granola, and juice for breakfast, you can create a meal with a name of your choosing that combines these individual food items. That way you can just add that meal instead of having to add each individual food item every time. Like when you add foods, you can include a cost for the meal. Once a meal is created, you can view its nutrient values the same way as you view them in your daily totals.\n\nFOODS - A list of over 5000 foods and their nutrient values that are separated  by category and can also be searched by name. By selecting a food and choosing its portion size, you can view all of the nutrients is offers. Adding a new food is as simple as entering the nutrient values right from the nutrition label.\n\nRDA - The Recommended Daily Allowance of some nutrients are given based on a 2000 calorie diet. The values in this section is used throughout the app to compare how you are doing meeting your nutritional need. Since the RDA is different for people based on their age, gender, or dietary need, the values can be changed. You may be following a diet where you want different values for Calories, Fat, Carbohydrates, or any other nutrient. To go back to the default values, just tap Reset.\n\nNo Ads! \nNo in-App Purchases!"

That’s all it takes to blend\nup a Zero Belly Smoothie, a unique mix of super nutrients that will flatten your gut,\nboost your metabolism, heal your digestive system, and turn off your fat genes for\ngood.\n\nWith fat-burning proteins and a specially selected array of high-powered fruits and\nvegetables, Zero Belly Smoothies—based on the New York Times bestseller Zero \nBelly Diet—are the fastest and most delicious ways ever created to sip off the\npounds!\n\nInside you’ll find a complete shopping guide, a bonus cleanse program, and more\nthan 100 intensely flavorful recipes, including tasty green drinks, fresh and fruity\nsmoothies, nutty, chocolatey shakes, and savory surprises.\n\nZero Belly Smoothies will help you\n• Lose up to 16 pounds in 14 days.\n• Melt away stubborn fat, from your belly first.\n• Put an end to bloating and discomfort.\n• Detox from unhealthy foods so you enjoy all-day energy.\n• Turn off your fat storage genes and make long-term weight loss effortless.\n• Look and feel younger and healthier than ever!\n\nYou’ll be stunned and inspired by the results of an amazing 500-person test panel—\nmen and women who lost weight quickly, and with ease, following the original Zero\nBelly diet, which included many of these Zero Belly Smoothies. In just the first 14\ndays\nBob McMicken, 51, lost 16.3 pounds.\nKyle Cambridge, 28, lost 15 pounds.\nMartha Chesler, 54, lost 11 pounds.\nMatt Brunner, 43, lost 14 pounds.\n\nFocusing your weight-loss efforts on drinks will help you quickly strip away flab in a\nnumber of ways. Here’s what makes Zero Belly Smoothies so effective:\n\n1. They take the stress out of cooking and eating well.\nStudies have shown that the more diverse your diet, the more likely you are to\nexperience weight gain. In fact, those who ate the widest range of foods showed a\n120 percent greater increase in waist circumference compared with those who had\nthe least diversity. In other words, people who have the best success at weight loss\npick a set number of foods and tend to stick to them. Zero Belly Smoothies allow\nyou to do exactly that.\n\n2. They crowd out the junk in your diet.\nZero Belly Smoothies come in all different flavors—chocolatey, fruity, green, and\neven savory—but they all have one thing in common: no added sugars. In a 2015\nstudy in Sweden, researchers followed 42,400 men over the course of 12 years.\nThey found that men who consumed at least two servings per day of sweetened\nbeverages had a 23 percent higher risk of heart failure compared with those who did\nnot.\n\n3. They battle food allergies and reduce inflammation.\nWhat’s also unique about Zero Belly Smoothies is that they are vegan: no milk, no\nyogurt, no whey protein. Plant-based protein powders are a low-sugar, high-fiber\nalternative to popular dairy-based supplements. A study by the University of Tampa \nthat compared plant protein with whey found it to be equally as effective at changing\nbody composition and boosting muscle recovery and growth!\n\n4. They make you feel fuller longer!\nStudies show that high-protein smoothies are highly effective at rushing nutrients to\nyour muscles and that blended fruit drinks, which include all the fiber, will actually\nkeep you fuller longer than fruit juices."

      "label": "Struggle free, healthy and practical recipes that are easy on the wallet. It’s as simple as that, and it’s a message that’s seen over 1 million people follow FitMenCook on social media.\n\nBe honest, have you ever heard these complaints about healthy eating?\n\n- “Eating healthy is too expensive!”\n- “It takes too long! I don’t have hours to spend in the kitchen.”\n- “Healthy food is too bland”\n- “I always end up cheating and slipping back in to bad habits”\n\nKevin Curry, founder of FitMenCook, has been there. After spotting a picture of himself on a friend’s Facebook wall he knew it was time for a change.\n\nHe followed all the common advice, changed to a healthy diet and started hitting the gym.\n\nFor a few months, things were great, but after a while he found himself craving the old foods he was trying so hard to avoid.\n\nHe got his hands on every book he could find on nutrition and started experimenting in the kitchen.\n\nHis aims were simple:\n\nA) Food should be easy to prepare and affordable\nB) Food should be vibrant and tasty, never boring\nC) Preparing food in advance is important\nD) Following a, b, c helps you achieve your fitness goals\n\nThe results for Kevin were game change and now he’s spreading message to the FitMenCook community on social media and inside the FMC app.\n\nTop 5 features:\n\n#1\nSHOPPING CART + APPLE WATCH\n\nWe've taken the hassle out of grocery shopping. Add any recipes you want to your shopping list and we'll organise the list by aisle, so you can easily find the items you need.\n\nThe shopping list also works on the Apple Watch.\n\n#2\nEASY STEP BY STEP VIDEO INSTRUCTIONS\n\nIf you’ve ever looked at recipe instructions and thought “this just looks too difficult for me” then you’ll find the included recipe videos very helpful. Not only is Kevin a great host, who’ll fill you with inspiration for healthy meals, but he’ll also break down the steps in a way that’s easy to follow.\n\n#3\nFOCUS ON MEAL PREP\n\nBuying ingredients in small quantities can make recipes more expensive. Not only that, but many of us don’t have time every day to spend in the kitchen.\n\nMeal prep is the solution. By designating two days of the week as your main cooking days, you can prepare your meals in bulk and eat healthy all week.\n\nThis is a crucial part of the app, and many of the meals are designed with meal preparation in mind, to make healthy living fit with a busy life.\n\n#4\nMACRO COUNTING AND INTEGRATION WITH APPLE HEALTH APP\n\nBodybuilders and fat-loss superheroes can rejoice as the FitMenCook app has nutritional information built right in! Recipes list calories, protein, carbs and fat. This data can then be shared with the Apple Health app.\n\n5#\nSCALE UP A RECIPE\n\nIncrease the serving sizes by tapping the + and - buttons in the recipe view. You can also switch the measurements between metric and imperial.\n\nThere’s more including:\n- 750+ recipes with more added each month\n- Search by ingredient: Type in Egg Avocado to see all recipes containing both of these ingredients\n- Share recipes with friends and family\n- Available in English and Spanish\n\nFor a video demonstration of the app in action, take a look at: http://fitmencook.com/app/\n\nOptional Meal Planner Subscription:\nFitMenCook Pro is available as a monthly (0.99 USD) or yearly (5.99 USD) subscription.

We'd love to help you get cooking!***\n\n#1 Food & Drink App and featured as one of Apple's \"Best New Apps\"!\n\nIt’s the Webby Award-winning app from Michelle Tam and Henry Fong, the James Beard Award nominated creators of Nom Nom Paleo—now available for both iPad and iPhone! Michelle and Henry’s Saveur Award winning food blog and New York Times bestselling cookbook are just the tip of the iceberg—this newly updated app makes cooking even more fun and inspirational, and takes all the guesswork out of cooking. Plus, now that the Nom Nom Paleo app’s available for iPhone, you can take these nomtastic recipes with you anywhere!\n\nFeatures:\n \n● Over 145 simple, tantalizing recipes, all free of gluten, soy, and refined sugar, sortable by food category, searchable by ingredients and category—the vast majority of which are approved for the Whole30® nutritional re-set program. You’ll find lots of recipes that are exclusive to this app, and not available on the Nom Nom Paleo website or cookbook. \n\n● More recipes are being added regularly! You won’t have to wait until future app updates—new recipes can now be added automatically to the app on your device!\n\n● More than 2,000 stunning, high-resolution photos showing every step of the cooking process.\n\n● Fun and visually-engaging new user interface and design, including a home display that allows you to quickly scroll through and visually select recipes.\n\n● Simple-to-follow instructions, including tips, shortcuts, and information about food and techniques.\n\n● An interactive, email-friendly grocery list that syncs across devices and makes food shopping a breeze.\n\n● An extensive “Paleo 101” primer that explains the benefits of the “caveman” diet and provides resources for more information about ancestral health and nutrition.\n\n● A Whole30-friendly 30-day sample meal plan with links to recipes.\n\n● An in-depth shopping guide with product reviews and links to sources for cooking tools and ingredients.\n\n● The ability to bookmark recipes, create a personalized category of favorite recipes, and add notes.\n\n● A “constant-on” function to prevent the screen from dimming while you cook.\n  \n● The ability to email complete recipes and shopping lists.\n\nPraise for Nom Nom Paleo:\n\n● The “Martha Stewart of Paleo.” –The New York Times\n\n● “Oddly provocative.” –Christopher Kimball of America’s Test Kitchen\n\n● “A must-have app.” –AppCraver\n\n● “Brilliantly designed.” –Apps Magazine\n \n● “Visually stunning.” –Gear Diary\n\n● “Always popping with flavor.” –The Kitchn\n\n● “Truly extraordinary.” –Michael Ruhlman, James Beard Award-winning food writer\n \nMessage from Michelle of Nom Nom Paleo:\n\nHey, Nomsters – my updated cookbook app is here, and it’s finally available for your iPhone!\n\nThis “cookbook on steroids” is a uniquely immersive culinary experience. It’s a visual feast packed with brand new recipes, as well as updated versions of classic Nom Nom Paleo dishes—all presented with my own special brand of whimsically snarky commentary. Food lovers and busy home cooks can visually follow each of my recipes from the pantry to the dining room table.\n \nBut that’s not all! For those who want to learn more about the “caveman” approach to nutrition and health, I’ve included a “Paleo 101” primer that explains why we eat whole, unprocessed, real foods (like meat, seafood, vegetables, fruits, and nuts) and avoid highly-processed and pro-inflammatory foods. You’ll also find an in-depth shopping guide, a 30-day meal planner, an interactive shopping list, and much, much more.\n \nMy hope is that this app will delight, engage, and inspire you to eat well and be well!\n \n● App development by Y Media Labs ●"

      "label": "For restaurant owners, bake shops, caterers, manufacturers of food products, chefs, and even home cooks.  With Salt & Pepper, you can:\n\nCreate recipes with an ingredient list, procedure, yield, preparation time, notes, and photos/videos.  Choose your recipe ingredients from your dynamically-filtered master ingredient list, then select various preparations (such as \"finely-diced\" or \"sautéed\"), from a pick-list of over 40 options.\n\nEnter costs for each ingredient in your recipe, and Salt & Pepper will display the total cost of the recipe, and the cost per serving.  Set a recipe's selling price, and Salt & Pepper will calculate the mark-up and profit information.  You can also add \"other costs\" to your recipes, which can be a percentage of the total ingredient cost, or based on quantity, such as per serving, per batch, or per unit.\"\n\nUse the Suppliers screen to create, edit, and delete ingredients.  Changes made to an ingredient's name, price, allergens, food energy, density, or usable portion are applied to all recipes containing that ingredient.  You can organize your ingredients by supplier, and further by category.\n\nRecord your inventory, and set minimum values.  Salt & Pepper will calculate the monetary value of each stock item, and the total value of your entire inventory.\n\nScale your recipes up or down, or to a desired yield.  The amount and cost of each ingredient, and the total cost of the recipe, are adjusted accordingly.\n\nSeparate a recipe's ingredients into multiple sections, such as \"For the Cake\", \"For the Frosting\", and \"For the Ganache\".  Re-order your ingredients and preparation steps by dragging them.\n\nUse one recipe as an ingredient in another recipe.  When \"Recipe A\" is used as an ingredient in \"Recipe B\", the cost, allergens, and food energy of \"Recipe A\"  become part of \"Recipe B\" (based on the quantity used).\n\nDuplicate recipes, in order to experiment with multiple variations.\n\nTrack the expiration dates of your ingredients.  If you choose, Salt & Pepper will notify you before your ingredients expire.\n\nEnter densities for your ingredients.  Densities allow the calculation of a recipe's cost or calories when an ingredient is purchased by weight, but the recipe measurement is in volume.\n\nManage shopping lists.  You can add ingredients to your shopping lists directly from your recipes.  Quantities from multiple recipes are automatically summed.  You can arrange your store's aisles to match the physical stores at which you shop, and you can arrange your ingredients in the order that they appear on the actual store shelves. \n\nCreate notes, with checklists, photos/videos, and a due date (with alarm).\n\nCreate custom categories for filing your recipes and notes.  A recipe or note can belong to multiple categories.  For meal planning, custom recipe categories can serve as menus, such as \"Rehearsal Dinner Menu\".  You can also create \"outlets\" to further categorize items based on location.  For instance, if you operate a number of restaurants, you could create a separate outlet for each.  \n\nLink your recipes and notes to related recipes and notes.\n\nShare individual recipes, suppliers, shopping lists, and notes with co-workers, family, and friends.  When changes are made to a shared item, everyone receives the changes.   You can also set \"abilities\" for each user.  For instance, you can specify whether a particular user is allowed to view or edit ingredient costs.\n\nPrint your recipes, suppliers, shopping lists, and notes.\n\nE-mail recipes and notes.  You can send them in PDF format, and as Salt & Pepper data files, which the recipient can import into Salt & Pepper.\n\nUse the Conversions screen to convert units of weight, volume, and temperature, and to perform price comparisons.\n\nSync your recipes, suppliers, shopping lists, and notes between all of your iOS devices.\n\nSalt & Pepper contains no advertisements."

      "label": "Sugar is in everything these days, from boxed cereals to pasta sauces; it's almost impossible to avoid unless you're eating a real food diet. The 7 Day Sugar-Free Detox was designed by the Young and Raw team of expert nutritionists and holistic health coaches to create a fun and cleansing experience for you while you break free from the chains of sugar. \n\nStudies show sugar can be highly addictive, so rest assured we've got your back when it comes to kicking it for good! Inside this detox, you're going to find two meal plans to choose from. Our Low-Sugar Plan has small amounts of natural sugar found in fruits. Our No-Sugar Plan is completely sugar free.\n\nRefined or processed sugar is incomplete in its nutrient profile, lacking minerals and vitamins required by our bodies for digestion. What ends up happening when we eat sugar, is our bodies have to seek out the proper minerals required for digestion and unfortunately, those minerals are \"borrowed\" from our mineral reserves. This can lead to mineral deficiency and other health issues that are today, considered \"modern diseases\". \n\nThe 7 Day Sugar Free Detox is designed to support:\n- Breaking sugar addiction\n- Weight loss\n- Liver & Kidney detox\n- Skin health \n- Balancing blood sugar \n- Mood balancing\n- Energy levels\n- Adrenal fatigue\n\nInside the 7 Day Sugar Free Detox you will find:\n- Low-Sugar Meal Plan which includes some fruit sugars\n- No-Sugar Meal Plan which is 100% sugar free\n- Recipes - along with a list of health benefits for each recipe\n- Shopping lists - to make shopping quick and easy, you can tick off items from the list\n- Morning and evening routines - including how to get a perfect night of sleep\n- Young and Raw's favorite books, quotes & documentaries\n- Frequently Asked Questions\n\nHow does the plan work to reset the body?\nThe 7 Day Sugar Free Detox was carefully crafted by experts to get you results while maintaining your sanity throughout the process! \n\nBy replacing sugar with fresh leafy greens, vegetables, seaweeds and seeds along with an abundance of healthy fats, your body will be less hungry for sugar. In the beginning, you may notice a withdrawal period as your body adjusts to running off of fat and real food rather than sugar and carbohydrates. Be patient with yourself throughout this process, it's not easy, but we know you can do it!\n\nThe meal plans have everything you need to detox, and because there are no added or refined sugars your liver and kidneys will get a much needed break from processed sugar.\n\nFor 7 days you're going to experience what it's like to enjoy only real, whole foods but don't forget that diet is only one part of the equation. Proper detox also includes getting enough fresh clean water and optimizing your sleep. Our sleep cycles ensure the body gets its time to effectively detox, renew and heal. The included sleep protocol was designed based on all of the information we have about the importance of optimized sleep and the experiments we have done, to create a protocol that really works. \n\nYour herbal protocol is always optional and if you're on any medications, pregnant or have a health condition, it's advised that you speak with your physician and consult an herbalist prior to taking new supplements. The herbal protocol is minimal yet powerful, including some of the most elite herbs for detoxing the liver, kidneys, creating clear skin and boosting energy in the process. \n\nIn Summary, the 7 Day Sugar Free Detox helps to reset the body by:\n- Gently cleansing the body and promoting toxin elimination\n- Gently introducing blood cleansing foods\n- Providing the body with enough healthy fats to begin removing a reliance upon sugar and processed carbohydrates\n- Encouraging a healthy sleep cycle \n- Creates a movement routine to stimulate the lymphatic system, the endocrine system and the detox organs\n- Hydrating effectively to flush the body of excess toxins and create electrolyte balance"

Once you complete the detox, you will get a chance to take an after picture which automatically gets stitched together, allowing you to see your incredible results in only 5 days. Share your results and testimonial with the click of one button to Nikki!\n\nGUIDES\n8 Sections of useful tips, tricks, and practical information to help you reach your health and wellness goals.

Great for travelers looking for a good meal around the country.\n\nThe Unofficial Guide to Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives has been one of the top 10 apps in the Food & Drink category almost every day for the last 6 months and was #1 for two weeks running. 80,000 users can't be wrong.\n\nWe've collected all the locations for you, geo-located them, and organized them by season and state. Every venue from the show is in the app, including the closed locations or those that have changed hands and names. \n\nSome of the restaurants have closed over the years. We've left them in the directory, but added the word *Closed* to the name of each so you don't waste your time trying to go there. \n\nMajor features: \n\n► 980 Locations (as of 8/5/2017) and updated every week after the new episode airs, which is more than every other app – including the Food Network's own Food on the Road app (because we own them all and we check each week). Also, we regularly update closed or new addresses as we're informed by users.\n\n► All locations are sortable by distance, alphabet, season, and state:\n\n► Links to 456 recipes (so far) featured on the show (which you can also use as Guy's eating list)\n\n► A Near Me map that lets you see as many or as few locations as you want \n\n► Recipes are sortable by season or by type of dish (main, side, breakfast, etc). \n\n► Post your visits to your Facebook or Twitter account.\n\n► Leave comments about why you love each location for others to see.\n\n► Update button if you find a mistake or a closed location\n\n► Facebook, Twitter and Yelp links for every location that has them\n\n-------------------\n\nSubscription - Track where you've been and where you haven't for $0.99/year reoccurring.\n- Checkin subscription is $0.99 annually, letting the user track which locations they've been to, and which ones they haven't.\n- Payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase.\n- Your subscription will automatically renew annually unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current subscription period.\n- Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current subscription period. Automatic renewals will cost the same price you were originally charged for the subscription.\n- You can manage your subscriptions and turn off auto-renewal by going to your Account Settings on the App Store after purchase.\nTerms of Service - http://bit.ly/gla-terms\n\nThis app is not affiliated with the Food Network or Guy Fieri, but created using publicly available information about the locations highlighted in the Diners, Drive-ins and Dives TV show. \n\nGoLocalApps designs travel and wine region apps and this one was a labor of love as we enjoy the show and wanted to find the diners as we traveled around the country. So we did this for ourselves and are sharing it with you. \n\nIf you have any problems with the app, or have suggestions use the support link or email us at support@golocalapps.com. We'll be happy to help you troubleshoot any issues. \n\nContent by Ross Rojek\n\n(GoLocalApps has made apps for wine regions, downtown associations, restaurant chains and TV shows.

Reactions to various \"natural\" compounds in foods can often create an array of health problems in individuals, from the GI tract to skin issues to neurological and hormonal imbalances. Food Sense Guide helps you identify your potential food sensitivities and minimize food reactions. \n\nFOOD SENSE GUIDE includes: \n\n - An easily searchable catalogue of 300+ foods. \n\n- The general levels of amines, FODMAPs, glutamates, gluten, histamine, lectins, oxalates, salicylates, sulfites, and thiols in various foods, as well nightshade and AIP status.\n\n - An overview of these various compounds, including typical reactions for those sensitive, and lists of foods high and low in them. \n\n - The ability to create your own personal lists and notes. \n\n - Easily export your lists to share or print. \n\n - Quick instant access to the levels of these compounds for anything you may eat! \n\n\n\n \"As a practitioner working with many patients with diet related issues and GI distress, this app provides a comprehensive, easily useable resource for those with food sensitivities.\" \n\n- Dr. Michael Ruscio, Bestselling Author of \"Healthy Gut, Healthy You\" and Host of \"Dr. Ruscio Radio\"\n\n\n\"My patients and readers will love this!

If paired correctly, your drink will compliment your food and add to your enjoyment. \nWe used the experience gained running delipair.com food-wine pairing website since 2015 to create ‘Delipair - Food and Wine’. Thanks to the advances in Machine Intelligence and increase of processing power available for mobile devices we were able to create an offline application more robust and versatile than server based solution behind delipair.com website.\n\nDelipair's digital sommelier engine automatically makes recommendation by creating aromatic fingerprint for your food and assessing the strength of aromatic bridge between food and each wine it knows.\n\nTo create food aromatic fingerprint Delipair's digital sommelier uses knowledge gained through (machine) learning ingredients and aromatic molecules of 1.3 million recipes from cuisines all around the world. That way you can simply enter a dish name straight from the restaurant menu or online cooking website and Delipair's digital sommelier will decipher its aromatic fingerprint. It works with ingredient names, or mix of dish names and ingredients as well.\n\nAromatic fingerprints of wines were developed in our laboratory, by scientific analysis of hundreds of wines fitting wine profiles reflecting multiple grape varieties, vinification methods and terroirs of wine regions. For this analysis we used gas chromatography (and we had more fun then scientists from CSI movies doing this).\n\nBased on our research of online wine shops we created a list of profiles to cover most popular wines on the market, and added a few odd but interesting wines we loved the most.\n\nGrape varieties available in Delipair:\n(in alphabetical order, application version 1.2)\n\nCabernet Sauvignon, Carmernere, Chardonnay, Chenin Blanc, Corvina, Gamay, Grenache, Merlot, Malbec, Molinara, Nebbiolo, Nero d’Avola, Pinot Gris, Pinot Noir, Primitivo, Riesling, Rondinella, Sangiovese, Sauvignon Blanc, Shiraz, Syrah, Tempranillo, Viognier, Zinfandel. \n\nWine countries available in Delipair:\n(in alphabetical order, application version 1.2)\n\nArgentina, Australia, Chile, France, Italy, Germany, New Zealand, South Africa, Spain, USA\n\nTraditional wine types and regions available in Delipair:\n(in alphabetical order, application version 1.2)\n\nAmarone, Barbaresco, Barolo, Beaujolais (Villages, Cru), Bolgheri (Super Tuscans), Bordeaux (Left Bank), Bordeaux (Right Bank), Brunello di Montalcino, Chablis, Chianti (Classico, Riserva), Cote d’Or, Cotes du Rhone, Passo Doble, Pouilly Fuisse, Pouilly Fume, Petit Chablis, Prosecco, Rioja (Joven, Crianza, Reserva, Gran Reserva), Spatlese (Riesling), Valpolicella (Classico, Ripasso), Vino Nobile de Montepulciano\n\nIt was our goal to make Delipair's digital sommelier as easy and friendly to use as possible. This application works 100% offline. Therefore you can get the recommendation instantly, without the need of WiFi or cellular data plan and without waiting for a server to respond. \n\nWe also value your privacy, therefore we don't collect any data you enter into our application. \n\nLast, but not least, when you buy 'Delipair - Food and Wine' application you instantly get access to all the features and future updates.\n\nWe do hope our application will enhance your dining experience. Cheers!"

      "label": "Caveman Feast for iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch contains 250 delicious Paleo recipes that are beautifully illustrated and easy to follow.\n\nThere's nothing really revolutionary about the Paleo diet. It's what our grandma's have been telling us for years: \"Eat real foods that are healthy, avoid highly processed factory foods and you'll feel better and live happier\".\n\nWhether you call it Paleo, real food, low carb, low sugar, grain-free, gluten-free ancestral, nutrient-dense, primal or whole food - the important thing is that the Paleo diet is a healthier way of eating. The list of benefits people have reported is enormous: \n● Weight loss ● More energy that doesn't vary wildly throughout the day ● Improved sleep ● Clearer skin ● Better digestion ● Improved fitness ● Reduced allergies. The list goes on but it's better to try it for yourself.\n\nThe 250 Paleo recipes included will help satisfy your cravings for delicious, healthy food. Inside Caveman Feast you'll find healthy breakfasts, filling main meals, tasty desserts, side dishes and snacks. \n\nRecipes include:\n● Perfect paleo burger\n● Paleo french toast\n● Healthy caveman cookies \n● Blueberry espresso brownies\n● Grilled buffalo shrimp\n● Smoked avocado lime pork chops\n● Apple dijon burgers\n● Homemade healthy mayonnaise\n● Caveman crunch bars\n● Sweet potato pasta\n● Beasty BBQ sauce\n● Caveman shepherd's pie\n\nFeatures in the app include:\n● Add recipes to your shopping list and see it organised by aisle, saving time at the grocery store\n● Track your calories and macros with our nutritional data\n● Increase or decrease recipe servings\n● Search by ingredient\n● Add notes to recipes\n● Share recipes with friends\n● Switch the measurement units\n● Plan a week of meals\n● Tick off your shopping list on your Apple Watch\n● Integrated with Apple Health\n\nThe quick and easy to follow recipes are by New York Times bestselling author George Bryant of civilizedcavemancooking.com. After decades in a constant battle with his weight and nearly losing both his legs while on deployment as a U.S. Marine, George decided to change his life. He went Paleo. What started as a simple website to share recipes with friends, has since grown into an award-winning food blog. After being in the Marines for 12 years, George now enjoys creating delicious Paleo recipes full-time, hoping to change as many lives as he can with real food recipes.\n\nGeorge works in collaboration with Abel James from the chart topping podcast \"The Fat-Burning Man show\" where he covers the Paleo lifestyle. Abel has been featured in Men's Health, Popular Science and Wired Magazine. You'll find exclusive content from Abel inside the app.\n\nNote: For users upgrading\nCaveman Feast 3.0 is available as a free update on iOS 9.3 and above.

Also remember to select the thickness of the edges and the bottom. A difference of a few millimetres will result in errors of several tens of grams.\n\n3 - Place the phone on the container.\n\n4 - Use your fingers to choose the diameter, making it match that of the container.\n\n5 - Place the phone next to the container and use your finger to choose the level of the measurement. If your phone has a cover, remove it, otherwise SUBTRACT the thickness of the cover from the thickness of the edge.\n\n6 - At this point you'll get the grams or millilitres if you are measuring a liquid.\n\nFor the first few times check the measurements, just to get started. Measurements made with this application are only approximate. They are quite precise, but they cannot be compared to measurements on scales."

Fromage provides a convenient pocket resource of fantastic cheeses made throughout the world for your culinary exploration.  The cheese library contains well beyond 1,600 world cheeses from over 35 countries and is continuously expanded thanks to suggestions from our established base of Fromage users worldwide.\n\nEach cheese entry features artistically presented cheese photos, historically narrated flavor descriptions, website links to the producer’s dairy or fromager, and suggested best choices for complementary wines.  You can add your own favorite cheeses to the standard library and include personal notes about any of the cheeses.\n\nSearching within the library for that special cheese can be by name, country, milk-type, texture, or by your own custom tags (such as #atmystore).\n\nSo, if you’re a classically trained chef, professional party planner, cheese buyer, or just plain cheese lover, grab Fromage, your favorite wine, and experience the wonderful and historic flavors of cheese.\n_________________________________\n\nFromage comes with the ability to create personal cheese notes, rate cheeses from 1 to 5 stars (included an “Avoid” rating), add cheeses to your favorite lists (Try, Buy, or Favorites categories), record tasting impressions with up to 70 tasting keywords, and search the cheese library.\n\nYou can also enter your own cheeses (including photos captured from your device camera) and list those cheeses automatically in the “My Additions” category.  There is also a “Share” feature so cheese information can be sent (via e-mail) to friends or to the developer for inclusion in future versions of Fromage. \n_________________________________\n\nInternet or Wi-Fi connection is not required for program use, which is great for remote locations when no data plan is available.\n\nWhen internet is available, Fromage uses iCloud to synchronize your cheese entries and notes between all of your Apple devices which can include iPhone, iPad, and Macintosh.\n\nThe application provides English, French, Spanish, and German languages when the iOS device settings are set to that language."

So simple, and yet it works perfectly.\n\nCatador goes further to include administrative features that make it even more useful in the field.\n\nFrom the Home screen, you can add and delete cupping flights, identifying the number of samples in each group, which are given generic alphabetic labels or numbers that can be given unique names. (Both Arabica and Robusta are available)\n\nAfter the day’s cupping is done (or when asked to turn in your Q Grader cupping evaluation), users can also permanently lock each flight so that it cannot be changed later. The system gives you a popup warning that the operation cannot be undone.\n\nNo cupping scoresheet application can be fully functional in the real world unless you have some way to export the data. Catador presently includes an email function that sends scores as a text document to any email address, as well as a .CSV file which may be imported into other applications or a worksheet. \n\nThere is also an Airprint option, where you may print the output to any Airprint enabled printer wirelessly.\n\nOn the latest version, you may also share your sessions using the Airdrop feature on all supported iOS devices."

With a unique UI and beautiful details, Kiff is the perfect companion in your journey to reduce food waste at home.\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\n• Add your packaged food in seconds with the barcode scanner.\n\n• Keep expiration dates under control so you can eat your groceries before it's too late.\n\n• Food open or stored for too long? Track the time since you opened, bought, or cooked your food.\n\n• Set the desired shelf life for each food and eat them before the time runs out.\n\n• Alerts, always on time. Kiff will notify you when your food is due soon.\n\n• Manage the food inventory and automatically add low-stock food to a list in the system's Reminders app.\n\n• All your groceries and leftovers in one app. Always in sight, so you know what to eat at a glance.\n\n• Find out what categories of food you consume and throw away more, and even identify those specific items that you always end up tossing away thanks to the consumption insights.\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK\n\nWhen you arrive home from the grocery store and before storing your food in the fridge or pantry, open Kiff and add each item to the app. As easy as setting a shelf life and an expiration date, if they have one.\n\nYou don't have to add all the groceries at once. Start with fresh produce and food that goes in the fridge or freezer. You can add those items stored in the pantry or with the farthest expiration date later on.\n\nFor leftovers and when you cook for the whole week, just right after storing them in the fridge or freezer, open Kiff, and add them. As easy as setting a shelf life and starting the tracker.\n\nThat's it! Kiff will remind you to eat your leftovers and groceries before they go bad.\n\nABOUT KIFF\n\nYou open the fridge any day, and there they are, the sour milk, the expired yogurt, bad-looking leftovers, or the rotten lemon. The incredible thing is that about 1/3 of the world's food production is lost or wasted—1.3 billion tons per year, around 170 and 180 kilos per person. The output of 30% of the planet's agricultural land (that's greater than the size of China!), along with 170 billion cubic meters of water, all wasted.\n\nOnce all this food breaks down, it produces a carbon footprint of 4.4 billion tons of CO2 each year. Between 8 and 10% of the global greenhouse emissions. The third-largest greenhouse gas emitter in the world, just after China and the USA.\n\n40% of all this waste is generated at home—expired produce and discarded or gone bad leftovers that we throw away because we have cooked too much. The annual cost for each family can be a surprising amount between $1,200 and $1,800 US dollars, depending on where you live on the planet.\n\nWe build Kiff with one goal in mind: help you eat your food in its best state possible. Because food loses its nutritional capabilities after keeping it for too long, and if spoiled, it can be a risk for your health. By eating fresh food, you waste less, save money, and help the planet.\n\nMORE\n\n• Visit https://kiff.app to know more.\n\n• Discover more about food waste at https://kiff.app/awareness/\n\n• Check out our tips at https://kiff.app/support/\n\n• Check out our Food and Leftovers Shelf Life Guide at https://kiff.app/support/tips/food-shelflife-guide/ to learn how long your food can be stored."

That’s all it takes to blend\nup a Zero Belly Smoothie, a unique mix of super nutrients that will flatten your gut,\nboost your metabolism, heal your digestive system, and turn off your fat genes for\ngood.\n\nWith fat-burning proteins and a specially selected array of high-powered fruits and\nvegetables, Zero Belly Smoothies—based on the New York Times bestseller Zero \nBelly Diet—are the fastest and most delicious ways ever created to sip off the\npounds!\n\nInside you’ll find a complete shopping guide, a bonus cleanse program, and more\nthan 100 intensely flavorful recipes, including tasty green drinks, fresh and fruity\nsmoothies, nutty, chocolatey shakes, and savory surprises.\n\nZero Belly Smoothies will help you\n• Lose up to 16 pounds in 14 days.\n• Melt away stubborn fat, from your belly first.\n• Put an end to bloating and discomfort.\n• Detox from unhealthy foods so you enjoy all-day energy.\n• Turn off your fat storage genes and make long-term weight loss effortless.\n• Look and feel younger and healthier than ever!\n\nYou’ll be stunned and inspired by the results of an amazing 500-person test panel—\nmen and women who lost weight quickly, and with ease, following the original Zero\nBelly diet, which included many of these Zero Belly Smoothies. In just the first 14\ndays\nBob McMicken, 51, lost 16.3 pounds.\nKyle Cambridge, 28, lost 15 pounds.\nMartha Chesler, 54, lost 11 pounds.\nMatt Brunner, 43, lost 14 pounds.\n\nFocusing your weight-loss efforts on drinks will help you quickly strip away flab in a\nnumber of ways. Here’s what makes Zero Belly Smoothies so effective:\n\n1. They take the stress out of cooking and eating well.\nStudies have shown that the more diverse your diet, the more likely you are to\nexperience weight gain. In fact, those who ate the widest range of foods showed a\n120 percent greater increase in waist circumference compared with those who had\nthe least diversity. In other words, people who have the best success at weight loss\npick a set number of foods and tend to stick to them. Zero Belly Smoothies allow\nyou to do exactly that.\n\n2. They crowd out the junk in your diet.\nZero Belly Smoothies come in all different flavors—chocolatey, fruity, green, and\neven savory—but they all have one thing in common: no added sugars. In a 2015\nstudy in Sweden, researchers followed 42,400 men over the course of 12 years.\nThey found that men who consumed at least two servings per day of sweetened\nbeverages had a 23 percent higher risk of heart failure compared with those who did\nnot.\n\n3. They battle food allergies and reduce inflammation.\nWhat’s also unique about Zero Belly Smoothies is that they are vegan: no milk, no\nyogurt, no whey protein. Plant-based protein powders are a low-sugar, high-fiber\nalternative to popular dairy-based supplements. A study by the University of Tampa \nthat compared plant protein with whey found it to be equally as effective at changing\nbody composition and boosting muscle recovery and growth!\n\n4. They make you feel fuller longer!\nStudies show that high-protein smoothies are highly effective at rushing nutrients to\nyour muscles and that blended fruit drinks, which include all the fiber, will actually\nkeep you fuller longer than fruit juices."

In BLW (Baby Led Weaning) you don't put spoons, or pieces of food in your baby’s mouth. You simply offer your baby food, and he eats what he wants.\n\nBaby-led weaning allows babies to control their solid food consumption by \"self-feeding\" from the very beginning of their experiences with food. Baby-led weaning places the emphasis on exploring taste, texture, color and smells as the baby sets their own pace for the meal, and chooses which foods to concentrate on. Instead of spooning food into your baby's mouth, you present him or her with varied finger foods from which to choose and he or she chooses what to eat and how much. If she doesn't touch the oatmeal balls you made for her you do not put them in her mouth, you just offer them to her again at another meal."

You use a simple interface to plan out meals like “Hamburgers on Thursday, Fish and Rice on Friday”. Recent meals are easily available or you can type in new items the first time you use them.\n\nMealPlan is a universal app, and will sync between your iPhone and iPad using either iCloud or Dropbox. Plan your meals on the iPad's big screen, and automatically have your grocery list with you on your phone. And access your grocery list from your Apple Watch.\n\nMealPlan creates your grocery list as you're planning meals. When you're done, tap the Grocery Basket to see the list, add new items, mark off items you already have, and then print it, email it, or sync it with your iPhone. This is a huge time saver!\n\nAnd, on the iPad, once you’ve used the app for a few weeks, the Magic Wand will help you quickly fill out subsequent weeks, with a quick suggestions interface.\n\nFeatures include:\n- Simple interface to plan out meals.\n- Keep track of recipes and the groceries they use.\n- Automatically generated grocery list based on your meal plan.\n- Save grocery lists for later use (think \"Party\" or \"Camping\").\n- Save a week's planned meals as a template to reuse.\n- Combined search/add box makes it easy to add new items.\n- Print out a week's plan to any AirPrint printer.\n- Configure your own meals: Add snacks, or remove breakfast if you don't want to plan it.\n- Email a plain text summary of the week's plan.\n- Add a note to any meal item, including clickable links.\n- Dropbox sync for families with multiple devices and accounts.\n- Use Siri for groceries: \"Add Milk to my Grocery List\".\n\n\"Before MealPlan, I’d buy food at the grocery store and then forget I had it .. a few days later it would go to waste. A few minutes every week standing in front of the fridge with MealPlan in hand will help you get the most out of what you have on hand. Plan it, print it out and stick it to your fridge!\"\n\nVisit the website for more information, and a detailed walkthrough of what MealPlan can do."

When determining the correct formula for a recipe, bakers use baker's percentages — weights calculated as a percentage of the flour weight. This app allows a baker to simply enter their ingredient percentages and all the calculations are taken care of.\n\nDetermining measurements for the perfect loaf of bread is tedious. With Baker Buddy all you have to do is enter your target end weight and the baker percentages of your ingredients.\n\nInstead of manually calculating your ingredients based on the weight of the flour, the app takes care of everything for you. There's even a handy multiplier feature for when you need to scale up.\nAll of your recipes are stored in your phone for later editing and viewing."

Easy to use, no fluff.\n\nEnter the billed amount, choose from the most common tipping rates, pay the total (or copy the numbers to the receipt), and that's it.\n\nTipping shouldn't be a daunting chore after you have enjoyed a great meal.

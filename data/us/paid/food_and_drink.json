It’s as simple as that, and it’s a message that’s seen over 1 million people follow FitMenCook on social media.\n\nBe honest, have you ever heard these complaints about healthy eating?\n\n- “Eating healthy is too expensive!”\n- “It takes too long! I don’t have hours to spend in the kitchen.”\n- “Healthy food is too bland”\n- “I always end up cheating and slipping back in to bad habits”\n\nKevin Curry, founder of FitMenCook, has been there. After spotting a picture of himself on a friend’s Facebook wall he knew it was time for a change.\n\nHe followed all the common advice, changed to a healthy diet and started hitting the gym.\n\nFor a few months, things were great, but after a while he found himself craving the old foods he was trying so hard to avoid.\n\nHe got his hands on every book he could find on nutrition and started experimenting in the kitchen.\n\nHis aims were simple:\n\nA) Food should be easy to prepare and affordable\nB) Food should be vibrant and tasty, never boring\nC) Preparing food in advance is important\nD) Following a, b, c helps you achieve your fitness goals\n\nThe results for Kevin were game change and now he’s spreading message to the FitMenCook community on social media and inside the FMC app.\n\nTop 5 features:\n\n#1\nSHOPPING CART + APPLE WATCH\n\nWe've taken the hassle out of grocery shopping. Add any recipes you want to your shopping list and we'll organise the list by aisle, so you can easily find the items you need.\n\nThe shopping list also works on the Apple Watch.\n\n#2\nEASY STEP BY STEP VIDEO INSTRUCTIONS\n\nIf you’ve ever looked at recipe instructions and thought “this just looks too difficult for me” then you’ll find the included recipe videos very helpful. Not only is Kevin a great host, who’ll fill you with inspiration for healthy meals, but he’ll also break down the steps in a way that’s easy to follow.\n\n#3\nFOCUS ON MEAL PREP\n\nBuying ingredients in small quantities can make recipes more expensive. Not only that, but many of us don’t have time every day to spend in the kitchen.\n\nMeal prep is the solution.

Recipes list calories, protein, carbs and fat. This data can then be shared with the Apple Health app.\n\n5#\nSCALE UP A RECIPE\n\nIncrease the serving sizes by tapping the + and - buttons in the recipe view.

We'd love to help you get cooking!***\n\n#1 Food & Drink App and featured as one of Apple's \"Best New Apps\"!\n\nIt’s the Webby Award-winning app from Michelle Tam and Henry Fong, the James Beard Award nominated creators of Nom Nom Paleo—now available for both iPad and iPhone! Michelle and Henry’s Saveur Award winning food blog and New York Times bestselling cookbook are just the tip of the iceberg—this newly updated app makes cooking even more fun and inspirational, and takes all the guesswork out of cooking. Plus, now that the Nom Nom Paleo app’s available for iPhone, you can take these nomtastic recipes with you anywhere!\n\nFeatures:\n \n● Over 145 simple, tantalizing recipes, all free of gluten, soy, and refined sugar, sortable by food category, searchable by ingredients and category—the vast majority of which are approved for the Whole30® nutritional re-set program. You’ll find lots of recipes that are exclusive to this app, and not available on the Nom Nom Paleo website or cookbook. \n\n● More recipes are being added regularly! You won’t have to wait until future app updates—new recipes can now be added automatically to the app on your device!\n\n● More than 2,000 stunning, high-resolution photos showing every step of the cooking process.\n\n● Fun and visually-engaging new user interface and design, including a home display that allows you to quickly scroll through and visually select recipes.\n\n● Simple-to-follow instructions, including tips, shortcuts, and information about food and techniques.\n\n● An interactive, email-friendly grocery list that syncs across devices and makes food shopping a breeze.\n\n● An extensive “Paleo 101” primer that explains the benefits of the “caveman” diet and provides resources for more information about ancestral health and nutrition.\n\n● A Whole30-friendly 30-day sample meal plan with links to recipes.\n\n● An in-depth shopping guide with product reviews and links to sources for cooking tools and ingredients.\n\n● The ability to bookmark recipes, create a personalized category of favorite recipes, and add notes.\n\n● A “constant-on” function to prevent the screen from dimming while you cook.\n  \n● The ability to email complete recipes and shopping lists.\n\nPraise for Nom Nom Paleo:\n\n● The “Martha Stewart of Paleo.” –The New York Times\n\n● “Oddly provocative.” –Christopher Kimball of America’s Test Kitchen\n\n● “A must-have app.” –AppCraver\n\n● “Brilliantly designed.” –Apps Magazine\n \n● “Visually stunning.” –Gear Diary\n\n● “Always popping with flavor.” –The Kitchn\n\n● “Truly extraordinary.” –Michael Ruhlman, James Beard Award-winning food writer\n \nMessage from Michelle of Nom Nom Paleo:\n\nHey, Nomsters – my updated cookbook app is here, and it’s finally available for your iPhone!\n\nThis “cookbook on steroids” is a uniquely immersive culinary experience. It’s a visual feast packed with brand new recipes, as well as updated versions of classic Nom Nom Paleo dishes—all presented with my own special brand of whimsically snarky commentary. Food lovers and busy home cooks can visually follow each of my recipes from the pantry to the dining room table.\n \nBut that’s not all! For those who want to learn more about the “caveman” approach to nutrition and health, I’ve included a “Paleo 101” primer that explains why we eat whole, unprocessed, real foods (like meat, seafood, vegetables, fruits, and nuts) and avoid highly-processed and pro-inflammatory foods. You’ll also find an in-depth shopping guide, a 30-day meal planner, an interactive shopping list, and much, much more.\n \nMy hope is that this app will delight, engage, and inspire you to eat well and be well!\n \n● App development by Y Media Labs ●"

      "label": "Welcome to the best-selling guide to the hit TV show Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives. 980 Diners locations as of 8/5//2017. No other app has every location like we do. UPDATED weekly with each new episode and from user updates. \n\nNEW FEATURE - Track where you've been and where you still need to go. In-app Purchase for $0.99 yearly.\n\n******\n\nAdded from Season 27: Episode 13; Barbecue, Batter and Beer Can Chicken\n\nRestaurants Added:\nThree's Bar and Grill, Kihei, HI\nHorse Thief BBQ, Los Angeles, CA\nBatterFish, Los Angeles, CA\n\n\n*****\n\nThis app has all the locations visited by Guy Fieri on the show, geo-located around you wherever you are. Great for travelers looking for a good meal around the country.\n\nThe Unofficial Guide to Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives has been one of the top 10 apps in the Food & Drink category almost every day for the last 6 months and was #1 for two weeks running. 80,000 users can't be wrong.\n\nWe've collected all the locations for you, geo-located them, and organized them by season and state. Every venue from the show is in the app, including the closed locations or those that have changed hands and names. \n\nSome of the restaurants have closed over the years. We've left them in the directory, but added the word *Closed* to the name of each so you don't waste your time trying to go there. \n\nMajor features: \n\n► 980 Locations (as of 8/5/2017) and updated every week after the new episode airs, which is more than every other app – including the Food Network's own Food on the Road app (because we own them all and we check each week). Also, we regularly update closed or new addresses as we're informed by users.\n\n► All locations are sortable by distance, alphabet, season, and state:\n\n► Links to 456 recipes (so far) featured on the show (which you can also use as Guy's eating list)\n\n► A Near Me map that lets you see as many or as few locations as you want \n\n► Recipes are sortable by season or by type of dish (main, side, breakfast, etc). \n\n► Post your visits to your Facebook or Twitter account.\n\n► Leave comments about why you love each location for others to see.\n\n► Update button if you find a mistake or a closed location\n\n► Facebook, Twitter and Yelp links for every location that has them\n\n-------------------\n\nSubscription - Track where you've been and where you haven't for $0.99/year reoccurring.\n- Checkin subscription is $0.99 annually, letting the user track which locations they've been to, and which ones they haven't.\n- Payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase.\n- Your subscription will automatically renew annually unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current subscription period.\n- Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current subscription period. Automatic renewals will cost the same price you were originally charged for the subscription.\n- You can manage your subscriptions and turn off auto-renewal by going to your Account Settings on the App Store after purchase.\nTerms of Service - http://bit.ly/gla-terms\n\nThis app is not affiliated with the Food Network or Guy Fieri, but created using publicly available information about the locations highlighted in the Diners, Drive-ins and Dives TV show. \n\nGoLocalApps designs travel and wine region apps and this one was a labor of love as we enjoy the show and wanted to find the diners as we traveled around the country. So we did this for ourselves and are sharing it with you. \n\nIf you have any problems with the app, or have suggestions use the support link or email us at support@golocalapps.com. We'll be happy to help you troubleshoot any issues. \n\nContent by Ross Rojek\n\n(GoLocalApps has made apps for wine regions, downtown associations, restaurant chains and TV shows.

Reactions to various \"natural\" compounds in foods can often create an array of health problems in individuals, from the GI tract to skin issues to neurological and hormonal imbalances. Food Sense Guide helps you identify your potential food sensitivities and minimize food reactions. \n\nFOOD SENSE GUIDE includes: \n\n - An easily searchable catalogue of 300+ foods. \n\n- The general levels of amines, FODMAPs, glutamates, gluten, histamine, lectins, oxalates, salicylates, sulfites, and thiols in various foods, as well nightshade and AIP status.\n\n - An overview of these various compounds, including typical reactions for those sensitive, and lists of foods high and low in them. \n\n - The ability to create your own personal lists and notes. \n\n - Easily export your lists to share or print. \n\n - Quick instant access to the levels of these compounds for anything you may eat! \n\n\n\n \"As a practitioner working with many patients with diet related issues and GI distress, this app provides a comprehensive, easily useable resource for those with food sensitivities.\" \n\n- Dr. Michael Ruscio, Bestselling Author of \"Healthy Gut, Healthy You\" and Host of \"Dr. Ruscio Radio\"\n\n\n\"My patients and readers will love this! It will save them huge amounts of time, as they can quickly identify which foods they can focus on stage, to steer clear of their triggers. Well done!\" \n\n- Dr. Alan Christianson, NYT Bestselling Author of \"The Adrenal Reset Diet\" and \"The Metabolism Reset Diet\"\n\n\n\"In \"The Hormone Fix,\" I promote eating an array of mineral-rich, alkaline-producing foods for hormonal health.

Oftentimes patients get confused as to why a food may be troublesome, not realizing that every food can have multiple mechanisms by which it can trigger discomfort in the body, from a histamine reaction to an all-out immune reaction.  This app is a must-have for any food sensitive individual to have with them when shopping at the supermarket or eating out.\" \n\n- Dr. Vincent Pedre, Bestselling Author of \"Happy Gut\"\n\n\n\"Whether you know your current food sensitivities or are trying to figure them out, Food Sense Guide will help you take charge of your food choices for peaceful eating, to support resilient health!\"\n\n- Ariane Resnick, CNC, Celebrity Chef and Bestselling Author of \"The Bone Broth Miracle\" and \"How to be Well When You’re Not\"\n\n\n\nDeveloper’s Note: Food Sense is intended to provide general amounts (in ranges of low, medium, and high) for the compounds found in various foods, as referenced in multiple studies and accredited sources. Please consult third party sources and conduct your own research for specific levels, especially if you struggle with severe sensitivities. The catalogue is constantly being updated.

The best-selling cookbook, Ratio: The Simple Codes Behind the Craft of Everyday Cooking, by me, Michael Ruhlman, is now an iPhone app that will help you calculate amounts of ingredients in all the fundamental culinary preparations.  When you know a ratio, you don’t know a recipe, you know 1,000.  And this application does all the calculating for you.\n\n “Cooking, like so many other creative endeavors is defined by relationships.  For instance, knowing exactly how much flour to put into a loaf of bread isn’t nearly as useful as understanding the relationship between the flour and the water, or fat, or salt.  That relationship is defined by a ‘ratio’ and having a ratio in hand is like having a secret decoder ring that frees you from the tyranny of recipes. ….Michael Ruhlman, in handing us mortals a power better suited to the gods, has changed the balance of kitchen power forever.” —Good Eats host Alton Brown\n\n\nWhat You Get:\n\n--THE 32 CRITICAL RATIOS that form the backbone of the culinary arts, with instructions: doughs, batters, meat preparations, custards, sauces (pasta dough and pizza dough, sponge cake and pancakes, fritters and crepes, stocks and sauces, crème caramel and chocolate sauce.\n\n--A CALCULATOR that figures out how much of each ingredient you need, no matter how many or how few people you want to serve.\n\n--An OUNCES-TO-GRAMS CONVERTER (ratios work no matter what unit you choose to use!).\n\n--DELICIOUS VARIATIONS FOR RECIPES on all the ratios, ideas for the creation of new dishes according to your tastes.\n\n--An easy way to STORE YOUR OWN RECIPES and notes that you’ve created from the basic ratios.\n\n--Quick fun ways to SHARE what your cooking with your fellow cooks, on Facebook and on Twitter.\n\n--Ratios is also a great way to understand and TWEAK YOUR OWN RECIPES, to help you make your pancakes even fluffier, your pizza dough crisper, your crème brulee richer."

They started back in 1986, bringing up their children in a tiny  Umbrian village while exploring the country. Italy soon had its way with them, turning them (and the children) into hopeless, unrepentant foodies. In their travels, they always enjoyed taking notes on regional specialities and obscure delights, and these became the basis of this app."

      "label": "Save time and money managing your fridge and pantry with Kiff, and always eat your food in its best state possible.\n\nBy eating fresh food, you waste less, save money, and help the planet. With a unique UI and beautiful details, Kiff is the perfect companion in your journey to reduce food waste at home.\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\n• Add your packaged food in seconds with the barcode scanner.\n\n• Keep expiration dates under control so you can eat your groceries before it's too late.\n\n• Food open or stored for too long? Track the time since you opened, bought, or cooked your food.\n\n• Set the desired shelf life for each food and eat them before the time runs out.\n\n• Alerts, always on time. Kiff will notify you when your food is due soon.\n\n• Manage the food inventory and automatically add low-stock food to a list in the system's Reminders app.\n\n• All your groceries and leftovers in one app. Always in sight, so you know what to eat at a glance.\n\n• Find out what categories of food you consume and throw away more, and even identify those specific items that you always end up tossing away thanks to the consumption insights.\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK\n\nWhen you arrive home from the grocery store and before storing your food in the fridge or pantry, open Kiff and add each item to the app. As easy as setting a shelf life and an expiration date, if they have one.\n\nYou don't have to add all the groceries at once. Start with fresh produce and food that goes in the fridge or freezer. You can add those items stored in the pantry or with the farthest expiration date later on.\n\nFor leftovers and when you cook for the whole week, just right after storing them in the fridge or freezer, open Kiff, and add them. As easy as setting a shelf life and starting the tracker.\n\nThat's it! Kiff will remind you to eat your leftovers and groceries before they go bad.\n\nABOUT KIFF\n\nYou open the fridge any day, and there they are, the sour milk, the expired yogurt, bad-looking leftovers, or the rotten lemon. The incredible thing is that about 1/3 of the world's food production is lost or wasted—1.3 billion tons per year, around 170 and 180 kilos per person. The output of 30% of the planet's agricultural land (that's greater than the size of China!), along with 170 billion cubic meters of water, all wasted.\n\nOnce all this food breaks down, it produces a carbon footprint of 4.4 billion tons of CO2 each year. Between 8 and 10% of the global greenhouse emissions. The third-largest greenhouse gas emitter in the world, just after China and the USA.\n\n40% of all this waste is generated at home—expired produce and discarded or gone bad leftovers that we throw away because we have cooked too much. The annual cost for each family can be a surprising amount between $1,200 and $1,800 US dollars, depending on where you live on the planet.\n\nWe build Kiff with one goal in mind: help you eat your food in its best state possible. Because food loses its nutritional capabilities after keeping it for too long, and if spoiled, it can be a risk for your health. By eating fresh food, you waste less, save money, and help the planet.\n\nMORE\n\n• Visit https://kiff.app to know more.\n\n• Discover more about food waste at https://kiff.app/awareness/\n\n• Check out our tips at https://kiff.app/support/\n\n• Check out our Food and Leftovers Shelf Life Guide at https://kiff.app/support/tips/food-shelflife-guide/ to learn how long your food can be stored."

When you're done, tap the Grocery Basket to see the list, add new items, mark off items you already have, and then print it, email it, or sync it with your iPhone. This is a huge time saver!\n\nAnd, on the iPad, once you’ve used the app for a few weeks, the Magic Wand will help you quickly fill out subsequent weeks, with a quick suggestions interface.\n\nFeatures include:\n- Simple interface to plan out meals.\n- Keep track of recipes and the groceries they use.\n- Automatically generated grocery list based on your meal plan.\n- Save grocery lists for later use (think \"Party\" or \"Camping\").\n- Save a week's planned meals as a template to reuse.\n- Combined search/add box makes it easy to add new items.\n- Print out a week's plan to any AirPrint printer.\n- Configure your own meals: Add snacks, or remove breakfast if you don't want to plan it.\n- Email a plain text summary of the week's plan.\n- Add a note to any meal item, including clickable links.\n- Dropbox sync for families with multiple devices and accounts.\n- Use Siri for groceries: \"Add Milk to my Grocery List\".\n\n\"Before MealPlan, I’d buy food at the grocery store and then forget I had it .. a few days later it would go to waste. A few minutes every week standing in front of the fridge with MealPlan in hand will help you get the most out of what you have on hand. Plan it, print it out and stick it to your fridge!\"\n\nVisit the website for more information, and a detailed walkthrough of what MealPlan can do."

Диета, даже самая вкусная, - довольно унылый процесс, а сообща этим противным делом заниматься куда легче: есть с кем поделиться, а ведь взаимная поддержка имеет огромное значение. И вообще, хорошая компания никогда не помешает. Но, когда выяснилось, что эта компания составляет полторы тысячи человек, причем собралась она всего за пару дней... Мне даже стало как-то страшновато. Потому что - ответственность, и все такое. Я даже представить себе не могла, что у меня будет столько единомышленниц... Как говорят в Интернете, такого масштабного флэшмоба я еще не видела. И тут еще я представила себе, что, если мы все похудеем... наша планета станет легче ровно на 10 тонн. И я сделала это. Мы все вместе целый месяц, сжав зубы, кулаки и все остальное, честно работали, худели, и тут же, у меня в блоге, обсуждали свои трудности и хвастались результатами. И они были, были! У самых дисциплинированных - просто невероятные. А потом я подумала, что, наверное, следовало бы написать об этом и для тех, кто читал меня не только в Интернете. Вдруг им тоже будет интересно? Вот так и получилась эта книжка."

After years of research and stomach aches, I wrote a guidebook for fellow food lovers: \"The Maui Foodist Bucket List\".\n\nAnd now, I have all of the locations from my book conveniently compiled into this handy app!\n\nThe app features over 100 of my favorite food, drinks, and agritourism experiences on Maui. It's categorized to make finding what you're looking for simple, and also has a feature allowing you to easily take notes as you cross items off your new \"Bucket-List\"!\n\nNOTE: This app is incredibly simple. This is just a small side project of mine, so please don't expect anything crazy. You tell it what you're looking for, it tells you my recommendation and links to the spot's Google business page.\n\nIf you have any questions or issues please email me or DM on Instagram!\n\nCheers,\nIver Marjerison\nMarjerison@gmail.com\nMauiFoodist.com\n@mauifoodist"

      "label": "Do you want to encourage your child to eat a healthy, balanced diet? Or are you looking for inventive ways to provide nutritious meals to your fussy eater?\n\nThe Fussy Toddler app includes a wide range of quick and easy recipes designed specifically for fussy eaters! The meals include a selection of breakfast, lunch, dinner and snack ideas, with nourishing, enjoyable uses of fruit and vegetables.\n\nWhy I created this app:\n\nEvery toddler goes through phases, particularly when it comes to food. Fussy eaters are notoriously difficult to cater for, especially when it comes to fruit and vegetables.\n\nMy daughter Annabelle has been through her fair share of fussy phases and, at times, still does. This app is my extension from the Baby-Led Weaning recipes I created in the early days of our food-journey; it builds on these by putting health, variety and excitement at the heart of each recipe to keep my fussy eater, and yours, interested by every meal.\n\nI know that when you’re a busy parent or carer, time spent working in the kitchen can seem like the last thing you want to do. That’s why I have created easy-to-prepare, delicious recipes that even the fussiest of eaters should devour in no time! How do I know? Because my own fussy eater, Annabelle, has taste-tested each of these recipes for you.\n\nIf you’re struggling to provide your child with healthy meals, then this app will provide you with tasty recipes to do so, whilst ensuring that they eat a varied balanced diet.\n\nKey App Features:\n\n* Over 110 delicious family recipes designed specifically for fussy eaters\n* A clean, bright design that is easy to navigate\n* Recipes divided into clear breakfast, lunch, dinner and snack sections\n* Search for your favourite family recipes by recipe name and ingredient\n* Add recipe ingredients directly into your shopping basket\n* Save your favourites so they are easily located in one place\n* Free help and support via the online support group (linked in the app)\n* Free app updates and improvements\n\nPlease feel free to contact me if you have a question or require any support; I am always happy to help.\n\nNatalie x"

We designed this app to take some of the pressure of remember when you seasoned your Texas Brisket, when your wrapped your baby back ribs or rested your Beef Ribs. \nWe got you covered, the app lets you save multiple cooks, be it same day or across days / weeks heck it, even months apart.\n\n* WEIGHT CONFIGURATOR\nSelect a weight for your meat to get a timeline with start / finish time according to your bbq goals. This has been a game changer for cooks planning out their days and routines."

      "label": "How many of us struggle with \"kitchen math?\" The Kitchen Calculator PRO app makes cooking and measuring so much easier. Kitchen Calculator PRO does all the recipe conversions for you, and makes it simple to scale recipes up (or down) to change the number of servings the recipe yields. With Kitchen Calculator PRO you can:\n\n1.Quickly scale your recipes (add, subtract, multiply, divide) using fractions!\n\n2.Convert ingredients from weight to volume, and vice versa ( cups to grams, ounces,  etc. )\n\n3.Supports several volume, weight, distance, and temperature conversions\n\n4.Enter amounts and view results in standard cooking fractions (1/2, 1/3, etc )\n\n5.Grow a database with your favorite ingredients! (see weight to volume )\n\n\nUSER COMMENTS\n\n***** Exactly what I've been looking for! - \"I just tested this out on a new cake recipe and it was simple, easy and accurate. The cake came out *perfect*!\" by njanehair.\n\n***** Yippee, perfection! - \"I cook 3 meals a day for my toddler and am always needing to scale recipes down so I'm not making ridiculous amounts of food\" by Cindi M.\n\n***** Brilliant - \"For a cook trained in the metric system, this tool is a dream come true\" by BeeDiana.\n\n\nSCALE YOUR RECIPES\n\nEasily convert and scale recipes in an instant. Doubling a recipe (or cutting a recipe in half) is simpler than ever before, with all the most common units of cooking measurement right at your fingertips. \n\n\nWEIGHT TO VOLUME CONVERSIONS\n\nWhat is so special about weight to volume conversions?\n\nWhen converting from weight to volume it is important to take into account the ingredient you are converting. As you know, a cup of sugar does not weigh the same as a cup of rice. Furthermore, a particular brand of sugar may weigh different from another.  This is all made easy with Kitchen Calculator PRO.\n\nSo, how does Kitchen Calculator handle weight to volume conversions?\n\n1.It comes with a database of common ingredients based on weight figures from the USDA (US Department of Agriculture).\n\n2.It allows you to quickly enter and save your own ingredient weight for more precise conversions.  In many cases, you can enter the values right off the product label, using fractions!  \n\n3.Kitchen Calculator will remember any saved ingredient information for future conversions.\n\nNOTE: The preset ingredient list is based on USDA  (US Department of Agriculture) figures and are approximate values. They may differ from the ingredients you use. For precise calculations we recommend entering the weights for your ingredients and, whenever possible using a scale.\n\nINGREDIENT DATA SOURCE\n\nU.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service. 2007.

      "label": "Sugar is in everything these days, from boxed cereals to pasta sauces; it's almost impossible to avoid unless you're eating a real food diet. The 7 Day Sugar-Free Detox was designed by the Young and Raw team of expert nutritionists and holistic health coaches to create a fun and cleansing experience for you while you break free from the chains of sugar. \n\nStudies show sugar can be highly addictive, so rest assured we've got your back when it comes to kicking it for good! Inside this detox, you're going to find two meal plans to choose from. Our Low-Sugar Plan has small amounts of natural sugar found in fruits. Our No-Sugar Plan is completely sugar free.\n\nRefined or processed sugar is incomplete in its nutrient profile, lacking minerals and vitamins required by our bodies for digestion. What ends up happening when we eat sugar, is our bodies have to seek out the proper minerals required for digestion and unfortunately, those minerals are \"borrowed\" from our mineral reserves. This can lead to mineral deficiency and other health issues that are today, considered \"modern diseases\". \n\nThe 7 Day Sugar Free Detox is designed to support:\n- Breaking sugar addiction\n- Weight loss\n- Liver & Kidney detox\n- Skin health \n- Balancing blood sugar \n- Mood balancing\n- Energy levels\n- Adrenal fatigue\n\nInside the 7 Day Sugar Free Detox you will find:\n- Low-Sugar Meal Plan which includes some fruit sugars\n- No-Sugar Meal Plan which is 100% sugar free\n- Recipes - along with a list of health benefits for each recipe\n- Shopping lists - to make shopping quick and easy, you can tick off items from the list\n- Morning and evening routines - including how to get a perfect night of sleep\n- Young and Raw's favorite books, quotes & documentaries\n- Frequently Asked Questions\n\nHow does the plan work to reset the body?\nThe 7 Day Sugar Free Detox was carefully crafted by experts to get you results while maintaining your sanity throughout the process! \n\nBy replacing sugar with fresh leafy greens, vegetables, seaweeds and seeds along with an abundance of healthy fats, your body will be less hungry for sugar. In the beginning, you may notice a withdrawal period as your body adjusts to running off of fat and real food rather than sugar and carbohydrates. Be patient with yourself throughout this process, it's not easy, but we know you can do it!\n\nThe meal plans have everything you need to detox, and because there are no added or refined sugars your liver and kidneys will get a much needed break from processed sugar.\n\nFor 7 days you're going to experience what it's like to enjoy only real, whole foods but don't forget that diet is only one part of the equation. Proper detox also includes getting enough fresh clean water and optimizing your sleep. Our sleep cycles ensure the body gets its time to effectively detox, renew and heal. The included sleep protocol was designed based on all of the information we have about the importance of optimized sleep and the experiments we have done, to create a protocol that really works. \n\nYour herbal protocol is always optional and if you're on any medications, pregnant or have a health condition, it's advised that you speak with your physician and consult an herbalist prior to taking new supplements. The herbal protocol is minimal yet powerful, including some of the most elite herbs for detoxing the liver, kidneys, creating clear skin and boosting energy in the process. \n\nIn Summary, the 7 Day Sugar Free Detox helps to reset the body by:\n- Gently cleansing the body and promoting toxin elimination\n- Gently introducing blood cleansing foods\n- Providing the body with enough healthy fats to begin removing a reliance upon sugar and processed carbohydrates\n- Encouraging a healthy sleep cycle \n- Creates a movement routine to stimulate the lymphatic system, the endocrine system and the detox organs\n- Hydrating effectively to flush the body of excess toxins and create electrolyte balance"

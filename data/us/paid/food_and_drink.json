      "label": "Struggle free, healthy and practical recipes that are easy on the wallet. It’s as simple as that, and it’s a message that’s seen over 1 million people follow FitMenCook on social media.\n\nBe honest, have you ever heard these complaints about healthy eating?\n\n- “Eating healthy is too expensive!”\n- “It takes too long! I don’t have hours to spend in the kitchen.”\n- “Healthy food is too bland”\n- “I always end up cheating and slipping back in to bad habits”\n\nKevin Curry, founder of FitMenCook, has been there. After spotting a picture of himself on a friend’s Facebook wall he knew it was time for a change.\n\nHe followed all the common advice, changed to a healthy diet and started hitting the gym.\n\nFor a few months, things were great, but after a while he found himself craving the old foods he was trying so hard to avoid.\n\nHe got his hands on every book he could find on nutrition and started experimenting in the kitchen.\n\nHis aims were simple:\n\nA) Food should be easy to prepare and affordable\nB) Food should be vibrant and tasty, never boring\nC) Preparing food in advance is important\nD) Following a, b, c helps you achieve your fitness goals\n\nThe results for Kevin were game change and now he’s spreading message to the FitMenCook community on social media and inside the FMC app.\n\nTop 5 features:\n\n#1\nSHOPPING CART + APPLE WATCH\n\nWe've taken the hassle out of grocery shopping. Add any recipes you want to your shopping list and we'll organise the list by aisle, so you can easily find the items you need.\n\nThe shopping list also works on the Apple Watch.\n\n#2\nEASY STEP BY STEP VIDEO INSTRUCTIONS\n\nIf you’ve ever looked at recipe instructions and thought “this just looks too difficult for me” then you’ll find the included recipe videos very helpful. Not only is Kevin a great host, who’ll fill you with inspiration for healthy meals, but he’ll also break down the steps in a way that’s easy to follow.\n\n#3\nFOCUS ON MEAL PREP\n\nBuying ingredients in small quantities can make recipes more expensive. Not only that, but many of us don’t have time every day to spend in the kitchen.\n\nMeal prep is the solution. By designating two days of the week as your main cooking days, you can prepare your meals in bulk and eat healthy all week.\n\nThis is a crucial part of the app, and many of the meals are designed with meal preparation in mind, to make healthy living fit with a busy life.\n\n#4\nMACRO COUNTING AND INTEGRATION WITH APPLE HEALTH APP\n\nBodybuilders and fat-loss superheroes can rejoice as the FitMenCook app has nutritional information built right in! Recipes list calories, protein, carbs and fat. This data can then be shared with the Apple Health app.\n\n5#\nSCALE UP A RECIPE\n\nIncrease the serving sizes by tapping the + and - buttons in the recipe view. You can also switch the measurements between metric and imperial.\n\nThere’s more including:\n- 750+ recipes with more added each month\n- Search by ingredient: Type in Egg Avocado to see all recipes containing both of these ingredients\n- Share recipes with friends and family\n- Available in English and Spanish\n\nFor a video demonstration of the app in action, take a look at: http://fitmencook.com/app/\n\nOptional Meal Planner Subscription:\nFitMenCook Pro is available as a monthly (0.99 USD) or yearly (5.99 USD) subscription.

We'd love to help you get cooking!***\n\n#1 Food & Drink App and featured as one of Apple's \"Best New Apps\"!\n\nIt’s the Webby Award-winning app from Michelle Tam and Henry Fong, the James Beard Award nominated creators of Nom Nom Paleo—now available for both iPad and iPhone! Michelle and Henry’s Saveur Award winning food blog and New York Times bestselling cookbook are just the tip of the iceberg—this newly updated app makes cooking even more fun and inspirational, and takes all the guesswork out of cooking. Plus, now that the Nom Nom Paleo app’s available for iPhone, you can take these nomtastic recipes with you anywhere!\n\nFeatures:\n \n● Over 145 simple, tantalizing recipes, all free of gluten, soy, and refined sugar, sortable by food category, searchable by ingredients and category—the vast majority of which are approved for the Whole30® nutritional re-set program. You’ll find lots of recipes that are exclusive to this app, and not available on the Nom Nom Paleo website or cookbook. \n\n● More recipes are being added regularly! You won’t have to wait until future app updates—new recipes can now be added automatically to the app on your device!\n\n● More than 2,000 stunning, high-resolution photos showing every step of the cooking process.\n\n● Fun and visually-engaging new user interface and design, including a home display that allows you to quickly scroll through and visually select recipes.\n\n● Simple-to-follow instructions, including tips, shortcuts, and information about food and techniques.\n\n● An interactive, email-friendly grocery list that syncs across devices and makes food shopping a breeze.\n\n● An extensive “Paleo 101” primer that explains the benefits of the “caveman” diet and provides resources for more information about ancestral health and nutrition.\n\n● A Whole30-friendly 30-day sample meal plan with links to recipes.\n\n● An in-depth shopping guide with product reviews and links to sources for cooking tools and ingredients.\n\n● The ability to bookmark recipes, create a personalized category of favorite recipes, and add notes.\n\n● A “constant-on” function to prevent the screen from dimming while you cook.\n  \n● The ability to email complete recipes and shopping lists.\n\nPraise for Nom Nom Paleo:\n\n● The “Martha Stewart of Paleo.” –The New York Times\n\n● “Oddly provocative.” –Christopher Kimball of America’s Test Kitchen\n\n● “A must-have app.” –AppCraver\n\n● “Brilliantly designed.” –Apps Magazine\n \n● “Visually stunning.” –Gear Diary\n\n● “Always popping with flavor.” –The Kitchn\n\n● “Truly extraordinary.” –Michael Ruhlman, James Beard Award-winning food writer\n \nMessage from Michelle of Nom Nom Paleo:\n\nHey, Nomsters – my updated cookbook app is here, and it’s finally available for your iPhone!\n\nThis “cookbook on steroids” is a uniquely immersive culinary experience. It’s a visual feast packed with brand new recipes, as well as updated versions of classic Nom Nom Paleo dishes—all presented with my own special brand of whimsically snarky commentary. Food lovers and busy home cooks can visually follow each of my recipes from the pantry to the dining room table.\n \nBut that’s not all! For those who want to learn more about the “caveman” approach to nutrition and health, I’ve included a “Paleo 101” primer that explains why we eat whole, unprocessed, real foods (like meat, seafood, vegetables, fruits, and nuts) and avoid highly-processed and pro-inflammatory foods. You’ll also find an in-depth shopping guide, a 30-day meal planner, an interactive shopping list, and much, much more.\n \nMy hope is that this app will delight, engage, and inspire you to eat well and be well!\n \n● App development by Y Media Labs ●"

UPDATED weekly with each new episode and from user updates. \n\nNEW FEATURE - Track where you've been and where you still need to go. In-app Purchase for $0.99 yearly.\n\n******\n\nAdded from Season 27: Episode 13; Barbecue, Batter and Beer Can Chicken\n\nRestaurants Added:\nThree's Bar and Grill, Kihei, HI\nHorse Thief BBQ, Los Angeles, CA\nBatterFish, Los Angeles, CA\n\n\n*****\n\nThis app has all the locations visited by Guy Fieri on the show, geo-located around you wherever you are. Great for travelers looking for a good meal around the country.\n\nThe Unofficial Guide to Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives has been one of the top 10 apps in the Food & Drink category almost every day for the last 6 months and was #1 for two weeks running. 80,000 users can't be wrong.\n\nWe've collected all the locations for you, geo-located them, and organized them by season and state. Every venue from the show is in the app, including the closed locations or those that have changed hands and names. \n\nSome of the restaurants have closed over the years. We've left them in the directory, but added the word *Closed* to the name of each so you don't waste your time trying to go there. \n\nMajor features: \n\n► 980 Locations (as of 8/5/2017) and updated every week after the new episode airs, which is more than every other app – including the Food Network's own Food on the Road app (because we own them all and we check each week). Also, we regularly update closed or new addresses as we're informed by users.\n\n► All locations are sortable by distance, alphabet, season, and state:\n\n► Links to 456 recipes (so far) featured on the show (which you can also use as Guy's eating list)\n\n► A Near Me map that lets you see as many or as few locations as you want \n\n► Recipes are sortable by season or by type of dish (main, side, breakfast, etc). \n\n► Post your visits to your Facebook or Twitter account.\n\n► Leave comments about why you love each location for others to see.\n\n► Update button if you find a mistake or a closed location\n\n► Facebook, Twitter and Yelp links for every location that has them\n\n-------------------\n\nSubscription - Track where you've been and where you haven't for $0.99/year reoccurring.\n- Checkin subscription is $0.99 annually, letting the user track which locations they've been to, and which ones they haven't.\n- Payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase.\n- Your subscription will automatically renew annually unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current subscription period.\n- Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current subscription period. Automatic renewals will cost the same price you were originally charged for the subscription.\n- You can manage your subscriptions and turn off auto-renewal by going to your Account Settings on the App Store after purchase.\nTerms of Service - http://bit.ly/gla-terms\n\nThis app is not affiliated with the Food Network or Guy Fieri, but created using publicly available information about the locations highlighted in the Diners, Drive-ins and Dives TV show. \n\nGoLocalApps designs travel and wine region apps and this one was a labor of love as we enjoy the show and wanted to find the diners as we traveled around the country. So we did this for ourselves and are sharing it with you. \n\nIf you have any problems with the app, or have suggestions use the support link or email us at support@golocalapps.com. We'll be happy to help you troubleshoot any issues. \n\nContent by Ross Rojek\n\n(GoLocalApps has made apps for wine regions, downtown associations, restaurant chains and TV shows.

      "label": "Use Fromage as your guide to worldwide cheeses, the #1 app preferred by cheese lovers.  Fromage provides a convenient pocket resource of fantastic cheeses made throughout the world for your culinary exploration.  The cheese library contains well beyond 1,600 world cheeses from over 35 countries and is continuously expanded thanks to suggestions from our established base of Fromage users worldwide.\n\nEach cheese entry features artistically presented cheese photos, historically narrated flavor descriptions, website links to the producer’s dairy or fromager, and suggested best choices for complementary wines.  You can add your own favorite cheeses to the standard library and include personal notes about any of the cheeses.\n\nSearching within the library for that special cheese can be by name, country, milk-type, texture, or by your own custom tags (such as #atmystore).\n\nSo, if you’re a classically trained chef, professional party planner, cheese buyer, or just plain cheese lover, grab Fromage, your favorite wine, and experience the wonderful and historic flavors of cheese.\n_________________________________\n\nFromage comes with the ability to create personal cheese notes, rate cheeses from 1 to 5 stars (included an “Avoid” rating), add cheeses to your favorite lists (Try, Buy, or Favorites categories), record tasting impressions with up to 70 tasting keywords, and search the cheese library.\n\nYou can also enter your own cheeses (including photos captured from your device camera) and list those cheeses automatically in the “My Additions” category.  There is also a “Share” feature so cheese information can be sent (via e-mail) to friends or to the developer for inclusion in future versions of Fromage. \n_________________________________\n\nInternet or Wi-Fi connection is not required for program use, which is great for remote locations when no data plan is available.\n\nWhen internet is available, Fromage uses iCloud to synchronize your cheese entries and notes between all of your Apple devices which can include iPhone, iPad, and Macintosh.\n\nThe application provides English, French, Spanish, and German languages when the iOS device settings are set to that language."

      "label": "Version 3 has a new Search facility that uses Machine Learning to generate possible results. \n\nYou take a photo of a plant you are trying to identify. You submit it to the the Search Engine and it provides possible foods it could be.  Much easier to use than the older search facility.  You can take multiple photos and see all results provided to aid your assessment of what the food is.\n\nHow many times have you been out and about in the countryside looked at a plant and wondered was it edible or not?  Well, if you are into the idea of free food then probably quite a lot.  But how many times have you had the foraging guidebook on you?  The answer, if you are me, is never when you see something interesting that you think you know what it is but are not sure.  But, how many times have you had your mobile phone on you?  Probably every time.  And finally after finding that special spot where the item grows how many times have you then been unable to find it again?  Probably quite a lot.  It could be in the middle of a wood or large wasteground.\n\nSo what is the solution?  This App that's what.  The App combines a list of the most common wild foods available in the UK (many of these plants grow outside of the UK as well), images of those foods and information about the food such as leaf, flower and stem identification information, habitat, season, uses and most importantly any warnings about the plant.  You can also record the locations of the foods found on the Maps so that you can find them again.\n\nEach food has the following information: Description, Habitat, Season, Uses and Warnings; a minimum of two images to aid in identification; notes to record your information about the food; a set of user specified locations shown on the Map.\n\nEach Food can be identified using the images and the description.  Once identified you can also record the location of the food found.  \n\nLocation use the inbuilt GPS or WiFi to locate you on the Map.  Obviously, the GPS can work anywhere whereas WiFi location is less accurate and not always available (especially in the middle of a wood).  Maps require an internet connection and a working data plan.\n\nYou can record you own notes about a food in general and you can also record notes about individual saved food locations.\n\nThere's also a Search facility to help you identify a food.  You may be looking at a plant with white flowers or a toothed leaf or both.  You can use the Search to look for those foods with white flowers or toothed leaves or white flowers and toothed leaves.  The list of foods changes when you search to show only those that satisfy the search.  Using the right combination of search terms could reveal an exact match."

Then you probably own a circulator or a similar device. To start, a zip-bag, a cooking pot and a thermometer is all you need. Many Sous Vide recipes work without special equipment. But you will need good advice!\n\nSous Vide has been adopted in professional kitchens for producing precise and consistent results. The Sous Vide method produces perfectly cooked food with outstanding flavor. Its success in high-end cuisine changed the culinary world. With a few starting tips anyone can use this technique. Step-by-step tutorials and Sous Vide timers (mini-recipes with an alarm) help you along the way.\n\nIdeas, suggestions or anything you would like to change? Contact us with your feedback on UserVoice!\n\nThe time for a piece of meat to reach a core temperature can be calculated. A formula using thermal diffusivity, thermal conductivity and surface heat transfer calculates the time such shapes as cylinders, cubes and steaks need to acquire a certain core temperature. Consider the PolyScience Toolbox App or Douglas Baldwin’s formulas for calculating pasteurization times.\n\nBut food is never an exact geometrical shape and waiting for an extra hour for a piece to reach an additional half a degree is impractical. Adjustments for speed and efficiency improve the Sous Vide experience. We have tested Sous Vide recommendations that work and tutorials that make the first steps easy - for professionals and home cooks alike!\n\nSous Vide - no other cooking method gives you so much control!\n\nDon’t get the Anova Pro or the new Anova Precision Cooker (2019) as these devices are no longer equipped with Bluetooth!"

      "label": "For restaurant owners, bake shops, caterers, manufacturers of food products, chefs, and even home cooks.  With Salt & Pepper, you can:\n\nCreate recipes with an ingredient list, procedure, yield, preparation time, notes, and photos/videos.  Choose your recipe ingredients from your dynamically-filtered master ingredient list, then select various preparations (such as \"finely-diced\" or \"sautéed\"), from a pick-list of over 40 options.\n\nEnter costs for each ingredient in your recipe, and Salt & Pepper will display the total cost of the recipe, and the cost per serving.  Set a recipe's selling price, and Salt & Pepper will calculate the mark-up and profit information.  You can also add \"other costs\" to your recipes, which can be a percentage of the total ingredient cost, or based on quantity, such as per serving, per batch, or per unit.\"\n\nUse the Suppliers screen to create, edit, and delete ingredients.  Changes made to an ingredient's name, price, allergens, food energy, density, or usable portion are applied to all recipes containing that ingredient.  You can organize your ingredients by supplier, and further by category.\n\nRecord your inventory, and set minimum values.  Salt & Pepper will calculate the monetary value of each stock item, and the total value of your entire inventory.\n\nScale your recipes up or down, or to a desired yield.  The amount and cost of each ingredient, and the total cost of the recipe, are adjusted accordingly.\n\nSeparate a recipe's ingredients into multiple sections, such as \"For the Cake\", \"For the Frosting\", and \"For the Ganache\".  Re-order your ingredients and preparation steps by dragging them.\n\nUse one recipe as an ingredient in another recipe.  When \"Recipe A\" is used as an ingredient in \"Recipe B\", the cost, allergens, and food energy of \"Recipe A\"  become part of \"Recipe B\" (based on the quantity used).\n\nDuplicate recipes, in order to experiment with multiple variations.\n\nTrack the expiration dates of your ingredients.  If you choose, Salt & Pepper will notify you before your ingredients expire.\n\nEnter densities for your ingredients.  Densities allow the calculation of a recipe's cost or calories when an ingredient is purchased by weight, but the recipe measurement is in volume.\n\nManage shopping lists.  You can add ingredients to your shopping lists directly from your recipes.  Quantities from multiple recipes are automatically summed.  You can arrange your store's aisles to match the physical stores at which you shop, and you can arrange your ingredients in the order that they appear on the actual store shelves. \n\nCreate notes, with checklists, photos/videos, and a due date (with alarm).\n\nCreate custom categories for filing your recipes and notes.  A recipe or note can belong to multiple categories.  For meal planning, custom recipe categories can serve as menus, such as \"Rehearsal Dinner Menu\".  You can also create \"outlets\" to further categorize items based on location.  For instance, if you operate a number of restaurants, you could create a separate outlet for each.  \n\nLink your recipes and notes to related recipes and notes.\n\nShare individual recipes, suppliers, shopping lists, and notes with co-workers, family, and friends.  When changes are made to a shared item, everyone receives the changes.   You can also set \"abilities\" for each user.  For instance, you can specify whether a particular user is allowed to view or edit ingredient costs.\n\nPrint your recipes, suppliers, shopping lists, and notes.\n\nE-mail recipes and notes.  You can send them in PDF format, and as Salt & Pepper data files, which the recipient can import into Salt & Pepper.\n\nUse the Conversions screen to convert units of weight, volume, and temperature, and to perform price comparisons.\n\nSync your recipes, suppliers, shopping lists, and notes between all of your iOS devices.\n\nSalt & Pepper contains no advertisements."

What started as a simple website to share recipes with friends, has since grown into an award-winning food blog. After being in the Marines for 12 years, George now enjoys creating delicious Paleo recipes full-time, hoping to change as many lives as he can with real food recipes.\n\nGeorge works in collaboration with Abel James from the chart topping podcast \"The Fat-Burning Man show\" where he covers the Paleo lifestyle.

When you know a ratio, you don’t know a recipe, you know 1,000.  And this application does all the calculating for you.\n\n “Cooking, like so many other creative endeavors is defined by relationships.  For instance, knowing exactly how much flour to put into a loaf of bread isn’t nearly as useful as understanding the relationship between the flour and the water, or fat, or salt.  That relationship is defined by a ‘ratio’ and having a ratio in hand is like having a secret decoder ring that frees you from the tyranny of recipes. ….Michael Ruhlman, in handing us mortals a power better suited to the gods, has changed the balance of kitchen power forever.” —Good Eats host Alton Brown\n\n\nWhat You Get:\n\n--THE 32 CRITICAL RATIOS that form the backbone of the culinary arts, with instructions: doughs, batters, meat preparations, custards, sauces (pasta dough and pizza dough, sponge cake and pancakes, fritters and crepes, stocks and sauces, crème caramel and chocolate sauce.\n\n--A CALCULATOR that figures out how much of each ingredient you need, no matter how many or how few people you want to serve.\n\n--An OUNCES-TO-GRAMS CONVERTER (ratios work no matter what unit you choose to use!).\n\n--DELICIOUS VARIATIONS FOR RECIPES on all the ratios, ideas for the creation of new dishes according to your tastes.\n\n--An easy way to STORE YOUR OWN RECIPES and notes that you’ve created from the basic ratios.\n\n--Quick fun ways to SHARE what your cooking with your fellow cooks, on Facebook and on Twitter.\n\n--Ratios is also a great way to understand and TWEAK YOUR OWN RECIPES, to help you make your pancakes even fluffier, your pizza dough crisper, your crème brulee richer."

      "label": "The food drink combination has a profound effect on your overall experience, either good or bad. If paired correctly, your drink will compliment your food and add to your enjoyment. \nWe used the experience gained running delipair.com food-wine pairing website since 2015 to create ‘Delipair - Food and Wine’. Thanks to the advances in Machine Intelligence and increase of processing power available for mobile devices we were able to create an offline application more robust and versatile than server based solution behind delipair.com website.\n\nDelipair's digital sommelier engine automatically makes recommendation by creating aromatic fingerprint for your food and assessing the strength of aromatic bridge between food and each wine it knows.\n\nTo create food aromatic fingerprint Delipair's digital sommelier uses knowledge gained through (machine) learning ingredients and aromatic molecules of 1.3 million recipes from cuisines all around the world. That way you can simply enter a dish name straight from the restaurant menu or online cooking website and Delipair's digital sommelier will decipher its aromatic fingerprint. It works with ingredient names, or mix of dish names and ingredients as well.\n\nAromatic fingerprints of wines were developed in our laboratory, by scientific analysis of hundreds of wines fitting wine profiles reflecting multiple grape varieties, vinification methods and terroirs of wine regions. For this analysis we used gas chromatography (and we had more fun then scientists from CSI movies doing this).\n\nBased on our research of online wine shops we created a list of profiles to cover most popular wines on the market, and added a few odd but interesting wines we loved the most.\n\nGrape varieties available in Delipair:\n(in alphabetical order, application version 1.2)\n\nCabernet Sauvignon, Carmernere, Chardonnay, Chenin Blanc, Corvina, Gamay, Grenache, Merlot, Malbec, Molinara, Nebbiolo, Nero d’Avola, Pinot Gris, Pinot Noir, Primitivo, Riesling, Rondinella, Sangiovese, Sauvignon Blanc, Shiraz, Syrah, Tempranillo, Viognier, Zinfandel. \n\nWine countries available in Delipair:\n(in alphabetical order, application version 1.2)\n\nArgentina, Australia, Chile, France, Italy, Germany, New Zealand, South Africa, Spain, USA\n\nTraditional wine types and regions available in Delipair:\n(in alphabetical order, application version 1.2)\n\nAmarone, Barbaresco, Barolo, Beaujolais (Villages, Cru), Bolgheri (Super Tuscans), Bordeaux (Left Bank), Bordeaux (Right Bank), Brunello di Montalcino, Chablis, Chianti (Classico, Riserva), Cote d’Or, Cotes du Rhone, Passo Doble, Pouilly Fuisse, Pouilly Fume, Petit Chablis, Prosecco, Rioja (Joven, Crianza, Reserva, Gran Reserva), Spatlese (Riesling), Valpolicella (Classico, Ripasso), Vino Nobile de Montepulciano\n\nIt was our goal to make Delipair's digital sommelier as easy and friendly to use as possible. This application works 100% offline. Therefore you can get the recommendation instantly, without the need of WiFi or cellular data plan and without waiting for a server to respond. \n\nWe also value your privacy, therefore we don't collect any data you enter into our application. \n\nLast, but not least, when you buy 'Delipair - Food and Wine' application you instantly get access to all the features and future updates.\n\nWe do hope our application will enhance your dining experience. Cheers!"

      "label": "RDA Planner is used to calculate the nutritional value of the foods you eat. This can be compared to the Recommended Daily Allowances to see if you are getting the nutrition you need. The app is divided into 4 main topics:\n\nDAILY - Keep track of the foods you eat each day. Tap Add Food to add a food to your daily total. This can be an individual food item or a meal that you have created that contains multiple food items.  The best way to add a food is by searching since there are over 5000 different foods you can add. They are also separated by categories if that is easier for you to choose from. Once a food is selected, choose the portion size. Add a cost to the food to see how much you spend and compare by measuring the cost per calorie for each day. Delete a food from your daily total by swiping left on the food item. To get a bigger picture of your daily foods, tap Planner. The planner shows your daily totals for each month. Tap a day to jump to that days totals, or long press on a day to delete all of the foods associated with it. To view more of the vitamins and nutrients consumed on a given day, tap \"View All\". This will show over 30 nutrients and how much you have consumed and compare to the recommended daily allowance. Tap a nutrient to see foods that contain it in high or low values. Also by tapping Info, a detailed description of that nutrient can be found.\n\nMEALS - You can combine multiple food items to make a meal. This will make it easier to add foods that you eat regularly. For example, if you commonly eat yogurt, granola, and juice for breakfast, you can create a meal with a name of your choosing that combines these individual food items. That way you can just add that meal instead of having to add each individual food item every time. Like when you add foods, you can include a cost for the meal. Once a meal is created, you can view its nutrient values the same way as you view them in your daily totals.\n\nFOODS - A list of over 5000 foods and their nutrient values that are separated  by category and can also be searched by name. By selecting a food and choosing its portion size, you can view all of the nutrients is offers. Adding a new food is as simple as entering the nutrient values right from the nutrition label.\n\nRDA - The Recommended Daily Allowance of some nutrients are given based on a 2000 calorie diet. The values in this section is used throughout the app to compare how you are doing meeting your nutritional need. Since the RDA is different for people based on their age, gender, or dietary need, the values can be changed. You may be following a diet where you want different values for Calories, Fat, Carbohydrates, or any other nutrient. To go back to the default values, just tap Reset.\n\nNo Ads! \nNo in-App Purchases!"

We used the rule of thumb that women need 2000 calories and men need 2400 calories per normal day and on a Fast Day you should eat a quarter of a normal day’s recommended calories.\n\nBut these normal values are just estimates, to get the maximum out of the 5:2 Fast Diet you should consume a quarter of the calories needed to maintain your particular weight. This value is different for each person because it takes into account your gender, age, weight, height & normal activity level.\n\nOur calculator app will allow you to more accurately work out your Rest Day Calorie Intake and therefore your more accurate Fast Day intake."

Bring this app, find what you like, and tap the speaker icon to hear the dish pronounced in Chinese (Cantonese or Mandarin) using iOS text-to-speech.\n\nI made this app after visiting Hong Kong and trying to crash course learn Cantonese in the food courts. The early focus was just on dim sum and Cantonese text-to-speech and my favorite restaurants, but has since expanded (based on user tips and requests and my own interests) to more broadly cover Chinese (and Chinese-American) food and include featrures such as Mandarin (traditional and simplified), search (English and Chinese), saving favorites, AI camera recognition of dishes, speech-to-text pronunciation practice, and over two thousand restaurants around the world (but they have to serve Cantonese dim sum, at least ha gow and siu mai, and I don't have a worldwide travel budget, so if I didn't list your favorite eateries, please let me know what they are!).\n\nTips:\n\nIf you don't hear the Chinese speech\n\n1) check the mute switch on your iPhone and make sure it isn't on.\n2) text-to-speech for a particular voice sometimes seems to require an internet connect, at least on initial use (same with speech-to-text, the microphone practice button).\n2) sometimes a device will have trouble accessing the text-to-speech voice (it's the Hong Kong Chinese voice used for Accessibility in Settings), so try turning your device off and on.\n\nTapping the speaker icon plays back the Chinese pronunciation at half speed to help you learn. Tap the microphone icon to bring up more options, including adjusting the playback speed, switching between Cantonese and Mandarin, and practicing speaking (the speed and language settings are also in Settings).\n\nAside from the default speed, the speech may sound not quite natural because the app does not play back recorded speech but instead uses iOS text-to-speech functionality, which utters one character (i.e. one syllable) at a time, which may not match how an entire compound word or phrase is normally pronounced (you can hear this effect when using Siri).\n\nTalk Dim Sum is developed with:\n\nThe dim sum icon from Stock Image Folio on Iconfinder.com.\n\nThe technicat logo designed by Dakota Snow.\n\nPhotos from many dim sum excursions.\n\nRegional map images from Wikipedia (Creative Commons License from Wikimedia).\n\nSwift open source packages: AlertToast, ImagePickerView, Qgrid, SQLite.swift, SwiftLog, SwiftUIPager, and SwiftyJSON."

      "label": "\"Kitchen Scales\" is the only app that, through a simple and pleasant interface, allows you to measure the amount of sugar, flour or liquids in a container of your choice.\n\nThe operation is very simple:\n\n1 - The first thing you will need is a glass or a regular-sized cup, preferably a transparent one.\n\n2 - Select what you want to measure and the shape of the container, either cylindrical or rectangular. Also remember to select the thickness of the edges and the bottom. A difference of a few millimetres will result in errors of several tens of grams.\n\n3 - Place the phone on the container.\n\n4 - Use your fingers to choose the diameter, making it match that of the container.\n\n5 - Place the phone next to the container and use your finger to choose the level of the measurement. If your phone has a cover, remove it, otherwise SUBTRACT the thickness of the cover from the thickness of the edge.\n\n6 - At this point you'll get the grams or millilitres if you are measuring a liquid.\n\nFor the first few times check the measurements, just to get started. Measurements made with this application are only approximate. They are quite precise, but they cannot be compared to measurements on scales."

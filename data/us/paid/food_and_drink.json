      "label": "Struggle free, healthy and practical recipes that are easy on the wallet. It’s as simple as that, and it’s a message that’s seen over 1 million people follow FitMenCook on social media.\n\nBe honest, have you ever heard these complaints about healthy eating?\n\n- “Eating healthy is too expensive!”\n- “It takes too long! I don’t have hours to spend in the kitchen.”\n- “Healthy food is too bland”\n- “I always end up cheating and slipping back in to bad habits”\n\nKevin Curry, founder of FitMenCook, has been there. After spotting a picture of himself on a friend’s Facebook wall he knew it was time for a change.\n\nHe followed all the common advice, changed to a healthy diet and started hitting the gym.\n\nFor a few months, things were great, but after a while he found himself craving the old foods he was trying so hard to avoid.\n\nHe got his hands on every book he could find on nutrition and started experimenting in the kitchen.\n\nHis aims were simple:\n\nA) Food should be easy to prepare and affordable\nB) Food should be vibrant and tasty, never boring\nC) Preparing food in advance is important\nD) Following a, b, c helps you achieve your fitness goals\n\nThe results for Kevin were game change and now he’s spreading message to the FitMenCook community on social media and inside the FMC app.\n\nTop 5 features:\n\n#1\nSHOPPING CART + APPLE WATCH\n\nWe've taken the hassle out of grocery shopping. Add any recipes you want to your shopping list and we'll organise the list by aisle, so you can easily find the items you need.\n\nThe shopping list also works on the Apple Watch.\n\n#2\nEASY STEP BY STEP VIDEO INSTRUCTIONS\n\nIf you’ve ever looked at recipe instructions and thought “this just looks too difficult for me” then you’ll find the included recipe videos very helpful. Not only is Kevin a great host, who’ll fill you with inspiration for healthy meals, but he’ll also break down the steps in a way that’s easy to follow.\n\n#3\nFOCUS ON MEAL PREP\n\nBuying ingredients in small quantities can make recipes more expensive. Not only that, but many of us don’t have time every day to spend in the kitchen.\n\nMeal prep is the solution. By designating two days of the week as your main cooking days, you can prepare your meals in bulk and eat healthy all week.\n\nThis is a crucial part of the app, and many of the meals are designed with meal preparation in mind, to make healthy living fit with a busy life.\n\n#4\nMACRO COUNTING AND INTEGRATION WITH APPLE HEALTH APP\n\nBodybuilders and fat-loss superheroes can rejoice as the FitMenCook app has nutritional information built right in! Recipes list calories, protein, carbs and fat. This data can then be shared with the Apple Health app.\n\n5#\nSCALE UP A RECIPE\n\nIncrease the serving sizes by tapping the + and - buttons in the recipe view. You can also switch the measurements between metric and imperial.\n\nThere’s more including:\n- 750+ recipes with more added each month\n- Search by ingredient: Type in Egg Avocado to see all recipes containing both of these ingredients\n- Share recipes with friends and family\n- Available in English and Spanish\n\nFor a video demonstration of the app in action, take a look at: http://fitmencook.com/app/\n\nOptional Meal Planner Subscription:\nFitMenCook Pro is available as a monthly (0.99 USD) or yearly (5.99 USD) subscription.

It offers one hundred and twenty two maps, defining the wine regions. It is NOT an encyclopaedia of wine, and does not give any textual definitions or comment. Wine Maps is a purely visual reference, which allows you to search for the location of a wine region. With the exception of the top wineries in Bordeaux, individual vineyards do not appear on the maps. There's just too many of them!\n\nEach map is one or two taps away from the main screen.

UPDATED weekly with each new episode and from user updates. \n\nNEW FEATURE - Track where you've been and where you still need to go.

Great for travelers looking for a good meal around the country.\n\nThe Unofficial Guide to Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives has been one of the top 10 apps in the Food & Drink category almost every day for the last 6 months and was #1 for two weeks running. 80,000 users can't be wrong.\n\nWe've collected all the locations for you, geo-located them, and organized them by season and state. Every venue from the show is in the app, including the closed locations or those that have changed hands and names. \n\nSome of the restaurants have closed over the years. We've left them in the directory, but added the word *Closed* to the name of each so you don't waste your time trying to go there. \n\nMajor features: \n\n► 980 Locations (as of 8/5/2017) and updated every week after the new episode airs, which is more than every other app – including the Food Network's own Food on the Road app (because we own them all and we check each week). Also, we regularly update closed or new addresses as we're informed by users.\n\n► All locations are sortable by distance, alphabet, season, and state:\n\n► Links to 456 recipes (so far) featured on the show (which you can also use as Guy's eating list)\n\n► A Near Me map that lets you see as many or as few locations as you want \n\n► Recipes are sortable by season or by type of dish (main, side, breakfast, etc). \n\n► Post your visits to your Facebook or Twitter account.\n\n► Leave comments about why you love each location for others to see.\n\n► Update button if you find a mistake or a closed location\n\n► Facebook, Twitter and Yelp links for every location that has them\n\n-------------------\n\nSubscription - Track where you've been and where you haven't for $0.99/year reoccurring.\n- Checkin subscription is $0.99 annually, letting the user track which locations they've been to, and which ones they haven't.\n- Payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase.\n- Your subscription will automatically renew annually unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current subscription period.\n- Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current subscription period. Automatic renewals will cost the same price you were originally charged for the subscription.\n- You can manage your subscriptions and turn off auto-renewal by going to your Account Settings on the App Store after purchase.\nTerms of Service - http://bit.ly/gla-terms\n\nThis app is not affiliated with the Food Network or Guy Fieri, but created using publicly available information about the locations highlighted in the Diners, Drive-ins and Dives TV show. \n\nGoLocalApps designs travel and wine region apps and this one was a labor of love as we enjoy the show and wanted to find the diners as we traveled around the country. So we did this for ourselves and are sharing it with you. \n\nIf you have any problems with the app, or have suggestions use the support link or email us at support@golocalapps.com. We'll be happy to help you troubleshoot any issues. \n\nContent by Ross Rojek\n\n(GoLocalApps has made apps for wine regions, downtown associations, restaurant chains and TV shows.

Bring this app, find what you like, and tap the speaker icon to hear the dish pronounced in Chinese (Cantonese or Mandarin) using iOS text-to-speech.\n\nI made this app after visiting Hong Kong and trying to crash course learn Cantonese in the food courts. The early focus was just on dim sum and Cantonese text-to-speech and my favorite restaurants, but has since expanded (based on user tips and requests and my own interests) to more broadly cover Chinese (and Chinese-American) food and include featrures such as Mandarin (traditional and simplified), search (English and Chinese), saving favorites, AI camera recognition of dishes, speech-to-text pronunciation practice, and over two thousand restaurants around the world (but they have to serve Cantonese dim sum, at least ha gow and siu mai, and I don't have a worldwide travel budget, so if I didn't list your favorite eateries, please let me know what they are!).\n\nTips:\n\nIf you don't hear the Chinese speech\n\n1) check the mute switch on your iPhone and make sure it isn't on.\n2) text-to-speech for a particular voice sometimes seems to require an internet connect, at least on initial use (same with speech-to-text, the microphone practice button).\n2) sometimes a device will have trouble accessing the text-to-speech voice (it's the Hong Kong Chinese voice used for Accessibility in Settings), so try turning your device off and on.\n\nTapping the speaker icon plays back the Chinese pronunciation at half speed to help you learn. Tap the microphone icon to bring up more options, including adjusting the playback speed, switching between Cantonese and Mandarin, and practicing speaking (the speed and language settings are also in Settings).\n\nAside from the default speed, the speech may sound not quite natural because the app does not play back recorded speech but instead uses iOS text-to-speech functionality, which utters one character (i.e. one syllable) at a time, which may not match how an entire compound word or phrase is normally pronounced (you can hear this effect when using Siri).\n\nTalk Dim Sum is developed with:\n\nThe dim sum icon from Stock Image Folio on Iconfinder.com.\n\nThe technicat logo designed by Dakota Snow.\n\nPhotos from many dim sum excursions.\n\nRegional map images from Wikipedia (Creative Commons License from Wikimedia).\n\nSwift open source packages: AlertToast, ImagePickerView, Qgrid, SQLite.swift, SwiftLog, SwiftUIPager, and SwiftyJSON."

Michelle and Henry’s Saveur Award winning food blog and New York Times bestselling cookbook are just the tip of the iceberg—this newly updated app makes cooking even more fun and inspirational, and takes all the guesswork out of cooking. Plus, now that the Nom Nom Paleo app’s available for iPhone, you can take these nomtastic recipes with you anywhere!\n\nFeatures:\n \n● Over 145 simple, tantalizing recipes, all free of gluten, soy, and refined sugar, sortable by food category, searchable by ingredients and category—the vast majority of which are approved for the Whole30® nutritional re-set program. You’ll find lots of recipes that are exclusive to this app, and not available on the Nom Nom Paleo website or cookbook. \n\n● More recipes are being added regularly! You won’t have to wait until future app updates—new recipes can now be added automatically to the app on your device!\n\n● More than 2,000 stunning, high-resolution photos showing every step of the cooking process.\n\n● Fun and visually-engaging new user interface and design, including a home display that allows you to quickly scroll through and visually select recipes.\n\n● Simple-to-follow instructions, including tips, shortcuts, and information about food and techniques.\n\n● An interactive, email-friendly grocery list that syncs across devices and makes food shopping a breeze.\n\n● An extensive “Paleo 101” primer that explains the benefits of the “caveman” diet and provides resources for more information about ancestral health and nutrition.\n\n● A Whole30-friendly 30-day sample meal plan with links to recipes.\n\n● An in-depth shopping guide with product reviews and links to sources for cooking tools and ingredients.\n\n● The ability to bookmark recipes, create a personalized category of favorite recipes, and add notes.\n\n● A “constant-on” function to prevent the screen from dimming while you cook.\n  \n● The ability to email complete recipes and shopping lists.\n\nPraise for Nom Nom Paleo:\n\n● The “Martha Stewart of Paleo.” –The New York Times\n\n● “Oddly provocative.” –Christopher Kimball of America’s Test Kitchen\n\n● “A must-have app.” –AppCraver\n\n● “Brilliantly designed.” –Apps Magazine\n \n● “Visually stunning.” –Gear Diary\n\n● “Always popping with flavor.” –The Kitchn\n\n● “Truly extraordinary.” –Michael Ruhlman, James Beard Award-winning food writer\n \nMessage from Michelle of Nom Nom Paleo:\n\nHey, Nomsters – my updated cookbook app is here, and it’s finally available for your iPhone!\n\nThis “cookbook on steroids” is a uniquely immersive culinary experience. It’s a visual feast packed with brand new recipes, as well as updated versions of classic Nom Nom Paleo dishes—all presented with my own special brand of whimsically snarky commentary. Food lovers and busy home cooks can visually follow each of my recipes from the pantry to the dining room table.\n \nBut that’s not all! For those who want to learn more about the “caveman” approach to nutrition and health, I’ve included a “Paleo 101” primer that explains why we eat whole, unprocessed, real foods (like meat, seafood, vegetables, fruits, and nuts) and avoid highly-processed and pro-inflammatory foods. You’ll also find an in-depth shopping guide, a 30-day meal planner, an interactive shopping list, and much, much more.\n \nMy hope is that this app will delight, engage, and inspire you to eat well and be well!\n \n● App development by Y Media Labs ●"

You can add your own favorite cheeses to the standard library and include personal notes about any of the cheeses.\n\nSearching within the library for that special cheese can be by name, country, milk-type, texture, or by your own custom tags (such as #atmystore).\n\nSo, if you’re a classically trained chef, professional party planner, cheese buyer, or just plain cheese lover, grab Fromage, your favorite wine, and experience the wonderful and historic flavors of cheese.\n_________________________________\n\nFromage comes with the ability to create personal cheese notes, rate cheeses from 1 to 5 stars (included an “Avoid” rating), add cheeses to your favorite lists (Try, Buy, or Favorites categories), record tasting impressions with up to 70 tasting keywords, and search the cheese library.\n\nYou can also enter your own cheeses (including photos captured from your device camera) and list those cheeses automatically in the “My Additions” category.  There is also a “Share” feature so cheese information can be sent (via e-mail) to friends or to the developer for inclusion in future versions of Fromage. \n_________________________________\n\nInternet or Wi-Fi connection is not required for program use, which is great for remote locations when no data plan is available.\n\nWhen internet is available, Fromage uses iCloud to synchronize your cheese entries and notes between all of your Apple devices which can include iPhone, iPad, and Macintosh.\n\nThe application provides English, French, Spanish, and German languages when the iOS device settings are set to that language."

      "label": "How many of us struggle with \"kitchen math?\" The Kitchen Calculator PRO app makes cooking and measuring so much easier. Kitchen Calculator PRO does all the recipe conversions for you, and makes it simple to scale recipes up (or down) to change the number of servings the recipe yields. With Kitchen Calculator PRO you can:\n\n1.Quickly scale your recipes (add, subtract, multiply, divide) using fractions!\n\n2.Convert ingredients from weight to volume, and vice versa ( cups to grams, ounces,  etc. )\n\n3.Supports several volume, weight, distance, and temperature conversions\n\n4.Enter amounts and view results in standard cooking fractions (1/2, 1/3, etc )\n\n5.Grow a database with your favorite ingredients! (see weight to volume )\n\n\nUSER COMMENTS\n\n***** Exactly what I've been looking for! - \"I just tested this out on a new cake recipe and it was simple, easy and accurate. The cake came out *perfect*!\" by njanehair.\n\n***** Yippee, perfection! - \"I cook 3 meals a day for my toddler and am always needing to scale recipes down so I'm not making ridiculous amounts of food\" by Cindi M.\n\n***** Brilliant - \"For a cook trained in the metric system, this tool is a dream come true\" by BeeDiana.\n\n\nSCALE YOUR RECIPES\n\nEasily convert and scale recipes in an instant. Doubling a recipe (or cutting a recipe in half) is simpler than ever before, with all the most common units of cooking measurement right at your fingertips. \n\n\nWEIGHT TO VOLUME CONVERSIONS\n\nWhat is so special about weight to volume conversions?\n\nWhen converting from weight to volume it is important to take into account the ingredient you are converting. As you know, a cup of sugar does not weigh the same as a cup of rice. Furthermore, a particular brand of sugar may weigh different from another.  This is all made easy with Kitchen Calculator PRO.\n\nSo, how does Kitchen Calculator handle weight to volume conversions?\n\n1.It comes with a database of common ingredients based on weight figures from the USDA (US Department of Agriculture).\n\n2.It allows you to quickly enter and save your own ingredient weight for more precise conversions.  In many cases, you can enter the values right off the product label, using fractions!  \n\n3.Kitchen Calculator will remember any saved ingredient information for future conversions.\n\nNOTE: The preset ingredient list is based on USDA  (US Department of Agriculture) figures and are approximate values. They may differ from the ingredients you use. For precise calculations we recommend entering the weights for your ingredients and, whenever possible using a scale.\n\nINGREDIENT DATA SOURCE\n\nU.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service. 2007.

Also remember to select the thickness of the edges and the bottom. A difference of a few millimetres will result in errors of several tens of grams.\n\n3 - Place the phone on the container.\n\n4 - Use your fingers to choose the diameter, making it match that of the container.\n\n5 - Place the phone next to the container and use your finger to choose the level of the measurement. If your phone has a cover, remove it, otherwise SUBTRACT the thickness of the cover from the thickness of the edge.\n\n6 - At this point you'll get the grams or millilitres if you are measuring a liquid.\n\nFor the first few times check the measurements, just to get started. Measurements made with this application are only approximate. They are quite precise, but they cannot be compared to measurements on scales."

Search your distinct beer list instantly. View and comment on your friend's check-ins. On top of all that, enjoy the world's fastest Untappd check-in experience, from your iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, or HomePod*!\n\n*** Apple Watch ***\nSearch for new beers and check in to your favorites right from your wrist!

Works with LTE!\n\n*** Message Extension ***\nQuickly send your recent check-ins to your friends in iMessage.\n\n*** Distinct Beers ***\nThat was an awesome märzen you had last fall, but now you're in the store a year later and can't remember just which brewery it was from. Type a few letters into Tappd That and view your ratings, all without an Internet connection.\n\n*** Activity Feed ***\nWant to see what your friends are drinking? Tappd That has you covered with the Activity view. You can toast your friends and comment on their check-ins, all from within Tappd That (activity data is not stored offline).\n\n*** Wish List ***\nDon't be the only Untappd user struggling to find bandwidth to pull up your wish list at GABF.

Your wish list will be updated immediately and synced to Untappd.\n\n*** Check In ***\nNot only is your personal beer history available offline, but you can add to your list as well. Check in to any of your offline beers, or search Untappd for a new one. With just a few taps, that beer in your hand will be logged. Tappd That can even attempt to guess your location based on previous bars you've visited. All that data is saved and available to search immediately offline. Even add to your check in list with your voice assistant.\n\nIf you've had a beer before, just swipe it to the right and you're automatically checked in. That's right, NO TAPS!

You probably don't, but Tappd That sure does. Search venues by city and quickly browse all beers consumed on the premise, based on your check-ins.

Tappd That strives to look good, be a good iOS citizen, and give you functionality you can't find anywhere else. This is an app I personally use every day, so I hope it can become a staple in your life too as you explore craft beers.\n * Optimized for VoiceOver and Dynamic Type\n * 100% native iOS code\n * Responsive and gesture-rich interface\n * Internationalized units and display\n * Handsome developer\n * iPad Pro ready, including Slide Over support\n * Ready for all the latest iOS devices\n\n*** NOTE ON RATE LIMITS ***\nTappd That can sync all of your data, but it may take a few hours. Untappd only allows 100 \"requests\" per hour from third-parties. A request consists of ~50 beers. After 100 requests have been received, Tappd That's access to your Untappd account is suspended for an hour. If you have a large amount of data, you will not be able to download it all at once. Tappd That will pick up where it left off when you come back after an hour.\n\nHave questions? Please follow @TappdThat on Twitter, visit https://tappdthat.com, or email in the Settings tab.

И я наконец–то, как мне кажется, нашла в гастрономии именно то, что мне нравится больше всего, — возможность непрерывно учиться и учиться у лучших из лучших. Кулинария в этом смысле занятие удивительно благодарное — совершенствоваться в ней можно бесконечно и с неослабевающим удовольствием. И эта книга — первая попытка разделить с вами мой накопленный опыт как старательного ученика, для меня драгоценный и важный.\nИ главное — я бы очень хотела, чтобы эта книга стала продолжением «Рецептышей», которые вот уже третий год подряд не хотят покидать номинацию «Кулинарный бестселлер». Почему? Потому что та книга была написана человеческим языком и при минимальных телодвижениях — потрясающий результат, это пишут мне мои дорогие читатели, и этих писем уже несколько тысяч (я не шучу).\nЗдесь я попыталась сделать что–то подобное. Я выбрала только то, что с чистой совестью опять можно обозвать Самым Простым. Только теперь от поваров, увешанных всевозможными звездами и многочисленными колпаками."

      "label": "The food drink combination has a profound effect on your overall experience, either good or bad. If paired correctly, your drink will compliment your food and add to your enjoyment. \nWe used the experience gained running delipair.com food-wine pairing website since 2015 to create ‘Delipair - Food and Wine’. Thanks to the advances in Machine Intelligence and increase of processing power available for mobile devices we were able to create an offline application more robust and versatile than server based solution behind delipair.com website.\n\nDelipair's digital sommelier engine automatically makes recommendation by creating aromatic fingerprint for your food and assessing the strength of aromatic bridge between food and each wine it knows.\n\nTo create food aromatic fingerprint Delipair's digital sommelier uses knowledge gained through (machine) learning ingredients and aromatic molecules of 1.3 million recipes from cuisines all around the world. That way you can simply enter a dish name straight from the restaurant menu or online cooking website and Delipair's digital sommelier will decipher its aromatic fingerprint. It works with ingredient names, or mix of dish names and ingredients as well.\n\nAromatic fingerprints of wines were developed in our laboratory, by scientific analysis of hundreds of wines fitting wine profiles reflecting multiple grape varieties, vinification methods and terroirs of wine regions. For this analysis we used gas chromatography (and we had more fun then scientists from CSI movies doing this).\n\nBased on our research of online wine shops we created a list of profiles to cover most popular wines on the market, and added a few odd but interesting wines we loved the most.\n\nGrape varieties available in Delipair:\n(in alphabetical order, application version 1.2)\n\nCabernet Sauvignon, Carmernere, Chardonnay, Chenin Blanc, Corvina, Gamay, Grenache, Merlot, Malbec, Molinara, Nebbiolo, Nero d’Avola, Pinot Gris, Pinot Noir, Primitivo, Riesling, Rondinella, Sangiovese, Sauvignon Blanc, Shiraz, Syrah, Tempranillo, Viognier, Zinfandel. \n\nWine countries available in Delipair:\n(in alphabetical order, application version 1.2)\n\nArgentina, Australia, Chile, France, Italy, Germany, New Zealand, South Africa, Spain, USA\n\nTraditional wine types and regions available in Delipair:\n(in alphabetical order, application version 1.2)\n\nAmarone, Barbaresco, Barolo, Beaujolais (Villages, Cru), Bolgheri (Super Tuscans), Bordeaux (Left Bank), Bordeaux (Right Bank), Brunello di Montalcino, Chablis, Chianti (Classico, Riserva), Cote d’Or, Cotes du Rhone, Passo Doble, Pouilly Fuisse, Pouilly Fume, Petit Chablis, Prosecco, Rioja (Joven, Crianza, Reserva, Gran Reserva), Spatlese (Riesling), Valpolicella (Classico, Ripasso), Vino Nobile de Montepulciano\n\nIt was our goal to make Delipair's digital sommelier as easy and friendly to use as possible. This application works 100% offline. Therefore you can get the recommendation instantly, without the need of WiFi or cellular data plan and without waiting for a server to respond. \n\nWe also value your privacy, therefore we don't collect any data you enter into our application. \n\nLast, but not least, when you buy 'Delipair - Food and Wine' application you instantly get access to all the features and future updates.\n\nWe do hope our application will enhance your dining experience. Cheers!"

Then you probably own a circulator or a similar device. To start, a zip-bag, a cooking pot and a thermometer is all you need. Many Sous Vide recipes work without special equipment. But you will need good advice!\n\nSous Vide has been adopted in professional kitchens for producing precise and consistent results. The Sous Vide method produces perfectly cooked food with outstanding flavor. Its success in high-end cuisine changed the culinary world. With a few starting tips anyone can use this technique. Step-by-step tutorials and Sous Vide timers (mini-recipes with an alarm) help you along the way.\n\nIdeas, suggestions or anything you would like to change? Contact us with your feedback on UserVoice!\n\nThe time for a piece of meat to reach a core temperature can be calculated. A formula using thermal diffusivity, thermal conductivity and surface heat transfer calculates the time such shapes as cylinders, cubes and steaks need to acquire a certain core temperature. Consider the PolyScience Toolbox App or Douglas Baldwin’s formulas for calculating pasteurization times.\n\nBut food is never an exact geometrical shape and waiting for an extra hour for a piece to reach an additional half a degree is impractical. Adjustments for speed and efficiency improve the Sous Vide experience. We have tested Sous Vide recommendations that work and tutorials that make the first steps easy - for professionals and home cooks alike!\n\nSous Vide - no other cooking method gives you so much control!\n\nDon’t get the Anova Pro or the new Anova Precision Cooker (2019) as these devices are no longer equipped with Bluetooth!"

With a unique UI and beautiful details, Kiff is the perfect companion in your journey to reduce food waste at home.\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\n• Add your packaged food in seconds with the barcode scanner.\n\n• Keep expiration dates under control so you can eat your groceries before it's too late.\n\n• Food open or stored for too long? Track the time since you opened, bought, or cooked your food.\n\n• Set the desired shelf life for each food and eat them before the time runs out.\n\n• Alerts, always on time. Kiff will notify you when your food is due soon.\n\n• Manage the food inventory and automatically add low-stock food to a list in the system's Reminders app.\n\n• All your groceries and leftovers in one app. Always in sight, so you know what to eat at a glance.\n\n• Find out what categories of food you consume and throw away more, and even identify those specific items that you always end up tossing away thanks to the consumption insights.\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK\n\nWhen you arrive home from the grocery store and before storing your food in the fridge or pantry, open Kiff and add each item to the app. As easy as setting a shelf life and an expiration date, if they have one.\n\nYou don't have to add all the groceries at once. Start with fresh produce and food that goes in the fridge or freezer. You can add those items stored in the pantry or with the farthest expiration date later on.\n\nFor leftovers and when you cook for the whole week, just right after storing them in the fridge or freezer, open Kiff, and add them. As easy as setting a shelf life and starting the tracker.\n\nThat's it! Kiff will remind you to eat your leftovers and groceries before they go bad.\n\nABOUT KIFF\n\nYou open the fridge any day, and there they are, the sour milk, the expired yogurt, bad-looking leftovers, or the rotten lemon. The incredible thing is that about 1/3 of the world's food production is lost or wasted—1.3 billion tons per year, around 170 and 180 kilos per person. The output of 30% of the planet's agricultural land (that's greater than the size of China!), along with 170 billion cubic meters of water, all wasted.\n\nOnce all this food breaks down, it produces a carbon footprint of 4.4 billion tons of CO2 each year. Between 8 and 10% of the global greenhouse emissions. The third-largest greenhouse gas emitter in the world, just after China and the USA.\n\n40% of all this waste is generated at home—expired produce and discarded or gone bad leftovers that we throw away because we have cooked too much. The annual cost for each family can be a surprising amount between $1,200 and $1,800 US dollars, depending on where you live on the planet.\n\nWe build Kiff with one goal in mind: help you eat your food in its best state possible. Because food loses its nutritional capabilities after keeping it for too long, and if spoiled, it can be a risk for your health. By eating fresh food, you waste less, save money, and help the planet.\n\nMORE\n\n• Visit https://kiff.app to know more.\n\n• Discover more about food waste at https://kiff.app/awareness/\n\n• Check out our tips at https://kiff.app/support/\n\n• Check out our Food and Leftovers Shelf Life Guide at https://kiff.app/support/tips/food-shelflife-guide/ to learn how long your food can be stored."

So simple, and yet it works perfectly.\n\nCatador goes further to include administrative features that make it even more useful in the field.\n\nFrom the Home screen, you can add and delete cupping flights, identifying the number of samples in each group, which are given generic alphabetic labels or numbers that can be given unique names. (Both Arabica and Robusta are available)\n\nAfter the day’s cupping is done (or when asked to turn in your Q Grader cupping evaluation), users can also permanently lock each flight so that it cannot be changed later. The system gives you a popup warning that the operation cannot be undone.\n\nNo cupping scoresheet application can be fully functional in the real world unless you have some way to export the data. Catador presently includes an email function that sends scores as a text document to any email address, as well as a .CSV file which may be imported into other applications or a worksheet. \n\nThere is also an Airprint option, where you may print the output to any Airprint enabled printer wirelessly.\n\nOn the latest version, you may also share your sessions using the Airdrop feature on all supported iOS devices."

When determining the correct formula for a recipe, bakers use baker's percentages — weights calculated as a percentage of the flour weight. This app allows a baker to simply enter their ingredient percentages and all the calculations are taken care of.\n\nDetermining measurements for the perfect loaf of bread is tedious. With Baker Buddy all you have to do is enter your target end weight and the baker percentages of your ingredients.\n\nInstead of manually calculating your ingredients based on the weight of the flour, the app takes care of everything for you. There's even a handy multiplier feature for when you need to scale up.\nAll of your recipes are stored in your phone for later editing and viewing."

Just click start and begin asking your questions. When a response is detected by the app the words will show visually in the text box along with audible speech. When you have finished your session just click stop. You can also look back at the responses you received during your session by clicking on the folder button.\n\n** Disclaimer **\nUse at your own risk.

      "label": "Apple Watch, Nest Thermostat, and Siri. Together at last.\n\n＊ The app has Siri Voice shortcuts for seamless Siri control of your Nest, from the iPhone, Watch, iPad, and HomePod. It fully supports Apple Watch LTE, and can work when the iPhone is not around - as long as the watch itself has internet access (either LTE or WiFi).\n\n＊ The app lets you monitor and control HomeKit thermostats like Ecobee, and functions largely the same with them as it does with Nest, except for the Siri Shortcuts functionality which is not needed with HomeKit. It lets you see your thermostat info on the Watch complications, and control it using the iOS widget.\n_____________\n\n• Using Siri voice shortcuts you can control many aspects of your Nest, such as instant activation of heating or cooling, setting the temperature by saying how many degrees you want to set, increasing/decreasing the temperature, and setting the Home/Away state. Thanks to Thermo Watch, It's all finally just one casual \"Hey Siri\" away, all with informative visual and verbal feedback.\n• From the watch face, tap on the Thermo Watch complication to open the app. Spin the Digital Crown, or Swipe up/down to adjust the temperature. You can start adjusting the moment the app opens.\n• On your iOS device you can see the thermostat info on the home screen widget, you can swipe to the widget panel to adjust the temperature on the interactive widget, or you can just open the app. Again, you can start adjusting the moment the controls appear.\n• From your Apple TV, open the app, and swipe up/down on the remote to change the temperate.\n\nThe app is fully functional with an initial purchase. The in-app purchases are used only for giving a tip to the developer.\n\nThe app will let you know with a chime and a tap, that the thermostat has received and applied your command.\n\nMonitor your Thermostats and Home/Away status right from the watch face, using complications that update in the background, without having to launch the app.\n\nYou can use Siri on your iPhone, Watch, iPad, or HomePod to control any of your thermostats. Record phrases that make most sense to you, such as \"Start Heating\" or \"Make it Cooler\". If you have multiple thermostats you can control them individually, by saying for example \"Start Heating Upstairs\" or \"Start Cooling the Living Room\".\n\nVisit https://thermowatch.net/siri website for the detailed instructions of Siri operation.\n\nSet Geofence around your home to reliably set the Home and Away state when you come and go.\n\nThe app supports multiple thermostats in multiple homes - just swipe left and right on your Watch screen to access them, or see them all at the same time in the iOS Widget and the app. Fahrenheit and Celsius are both supported.\n\nBeyond that, you can press the Watch screen firmly for additional functions, like switching to a heating or cooling mode, setting the away status, choosing the active temperature sensor, or turning the fan on and off.\n\nWhile the app's minimalist looks betray the simplicity of its operation, what they don't show is the amount of planning, design, development and refinement that went into it, ensuring it becomes something that is enjoyable to use and experience.\n\nThermo Watch does not collect any of your data. Your login information, thermostat settings, and any activity - all of it flows exclusively between your devices and Nest. Author of Thermo Watch does not receive any of it, at any point.\nThis app and its developer are unaffiliated with Google Inc. or Google Nest. Nest is a trademark of Google Inc."

      "label": "The Secret to Money is an app that is designed to change the way you think about money, and to radically change the circumstances of money in your life.\n\nInspired by Rhonda Byrne's worldwide best selling phenomenon, The Secret, in this app you will develop a whole new perspective on your own personal finances and potential to live a life of abundance.\n\nThe Secret to Money is a personal development program of games and daily activities created by Rhonda Byrne herself, featuring 6 powerful Secret-inspired practices that will help you develop a wealth mindset:\n\nDESIRES\nPURCHASES\nMANIFESTED MONEY\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS\nAFFIRMATIONS\nGIVING\n\nDESIRES: In this practice, you create a list of 7 things you would buy if money were no object. This \"Secret\" list reminds you of why you want more money in your life, and what it would actually feel like to have the things you desire most.\n\nPURCHASES: In this practice, you will change your mindset about money by spending large amounts of money in your imagination. Every day, you will receive virtual checks in escalating amounts from the Bank of the Universe, as first introduced in The Secret book. Using your imagination, you “spend” each check on whatever you want or need, and record these purchases within the app. Currencies are localised for each country and set according to the language and location setting on the phone or tablet.\n\nMANIFESTED MONEY: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have manifested money today - money you have received, saved, were gifted or refunded. You will be surprised by how much \"Secret\" money you begin to manifest every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS: When it comes to money, a little bit of inspiration goes a long way towards increasing the money in your life. In this daily practice, you will receive inspiring, financially themed messages drawn from The Secret books in order to help you change the way you think about money. Each inspiration is available to share.\n\nAFFIRMATIONS: Affirmations are positive statements that you make to create a positive mindset and change your life on a particular subject. In this daily practice, you will read 25 unique affirmations of wealth and abundance inspired by The Secret to help change your money mindset.\n\nGIVING: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have given to others - charitable donations, tips, gifts and giveaways, covering the check at dinner, or buying coffee for a friend.  You will be surprised by how much you give to others every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nThe Secret to Money was designed specifically for you as your invitation to use The Secret in order to live the life of your dreams. As Rhonda says herself:\n\n\"Like many people, I was brought up with the belief that money is hard to come by, and that you have to work really hard for money. I even had the belief that I would never have much money because my family didn’t have money.\n\n\"All these beliefs came from just one belief – a belief in a lack of money.\n\n\"So, in 2004, while researching for The Secret film, I created many different money practices and invented lots of imaginary money games in order to change my belief in a lack of money to a belief in an abundance of money. I committed to these practices, and did them every day. And today, there is no lack in my life whatsoever.\n\n\"The Secret team has taken my life-changing money practices that took me from lack to abundance and put them into The Secret to Money App. The App is simple, practical, and designed to radically change the circumstances of money in your life, as it did for me.\"\n\nAvailable in English, Spanish, German, French, Japanese, Korean, Hindi and Mandarin."

From Polynesian (Tahitian, Samoan, Tongan, etc.) tatau. In Marquesan, tatu.\" Before the importation of the Polynesian word, the practice of tattooing had been described in the West as pricking, painting, or staining. Sailors on the voyage later introduced both the word and reintroduced the concept of tattooing to Europe.\n\nThis is not to be confused with the origins of the word for the military drumbeat — see military tattoo. In this case, the English word tattoo is derived from the Dutch word taptoe (OED).\n\nThe first written reference to the word tattoo (or tatau), appears in the journal of Joseph Banks (24 February 1743 – 19 June 1820), the naturalist aboard Captain Cook's ship the HMS Endeavour: \"I shall now mention the way they mark themselves indelibly, each of them is so marked by their humor or disposition\".\n\nThe word \"tattoo\" was brought to Europe by the explorer James Cook, when he returned in 1771 from his first voyage to Tahiti and New Zealand. In his narrative of the voyage, he refers to an operation called \"tattaw\". Before this it had been described as scarring, painting, or staining\n\nTattoo enthusiasts may refer to tattoos as \"ink\", \"pieces\", \"skin art\", \"tattoo art\", \"tats\", or \"work\"; to the creators as \"tattoo artists\", \"tattooers\", or \"tattooists\"; and to places where they work as \"tattoo shops\", \"tattoo studios\", or \"tattoo parlors\".\n\n\nA tattooed man's back, Japan, c. 1875\nUsage of the terms \"skin art\", \"tattoo art\", \"pieces\", and work\" is gaining greater support,[citation needed] with mainstream art galleries holding exhibitions of both conventional and custom tattoo designs. Beyond Skin, at the Museum of Croydon, is an example of this as it challenges the stereotypical view of tattoos and who has them. Copyrighted tattoo designs that are mass-produced and sent to tattoo artists are known as \"flash\", a notable instance of industrial design. Flash sheets are prominently displayed in many tattoo parlors for the purpose of providing both inspiration and ready-made tattoo images to customers.\n\nThe Japanese word irezumi means \"insertion of ink\" and can mean tattoos using tebori, the traditional Japanese hand method, a Western-style machine, or for that matter, any method of tattooing using insertion of ink. The most common word used for traditional Japanese tattoo designs is Horimono. Japanese may use the word \"tattoo\" to mean non-Japanese styles of tattooing."

With the intuitive layout and design of the app, it is fast and easy to connect to any B-hyve Pro controller through WiFi or, if WiFi is not available, directly through Bluetooth right at the timer location.  Once connected to WiFi, B-hyve can be set up in smart mode to assist in delivering the right amount of water to plants, saving clients water and money.\nThis is the companion App for award-winning B-hyve Pro irrigation controllers. Homeowners can download the non-Pro version of the B-hyve App at no charge.\n\n***KEY FEATURES***\nWIFI and BLUETOOTH – Because WiFi is not always available on a job site, the B-hyve app and controller allow you to set up and operate the controller using Bluetooth. Once a WiFi connection is established at a site, the owner of the WiFi router can provide a permission code that enables off-site management of the controller from anywhere in the world.\n\nEPA- AND SWAT-CERTIFIED – Having passed the rigorous EPA WaterSense and SWAT certifications, the B-hyve Pro Controller with Smart Watering is certified to use water more efficiently and is eligible for rebates in many cities or water districts across the country.\n\nFLEXIBLE SCHEDULING – You can set the controller to water in two basic ways: 1) on a fixed schedule, such as during a new landscape grow-in period; 2) with Smart Watering, and let local weather conditions determine the schedule.\n\nMULTI-SITE MANAGEMENT – You can manage and control an unlimited number of B-hyve controllers from the convenience of one application.  Once the timer is connected to the Internet, secure access can be shared in a number of different combinations using an app-generated code.\n\nCATCH CUPS – With various water savings options integrated right into the app, there are multiple ways to achieve optimum water savings with the B-hyve Pro Timer.  In addition to Smart Watering, it incorporates the award-winning catch-cup feature right into the app to deliver up to 25% more water savings over other smart controllers.\n\nALEXA – Works with Alexa.

      "label": "Pleasure Machine is a simple erotic game for couples with slot machine interface, and is ideal for heating up your foreplay.\n \nThe erotic slot machine features three rotating reels with displayed parts of the human body, erotic activities and time limits. By starting the slot machine, the first partner sets all three reels in motion. After the reels come to a halt, he/she can already look forward to the sweet prize - a random erotic experience being the combination of the activity, at which bodypart to be performed, and for how long. The partners take turns and so after the activity is over the other partner pushes the SPIN button and awaits his/her erotic price.\n \nBut be careful, because it is not always clear who is going to please whom. Each turn is a thrilling experience right to the last moment thanks to the negative time values on the time limit reel. When the negative time limit appears, the partner who spun the reels will treat his/her partner.\n \nIn this game, you can either use the provided slot machines or create your own. You can change the slot machines during the game to accommodate your taste for the softer or more daring tasks.   \n \nFor the quick start, there are five predefined erotic slot machines available, carefully created to avoid unreal combinations. You can adjust each slot machine to suit your preferences, and also to create your own.  There are many possibilities to think of and it’s up to you and your imagination which stimulating combinations you will create.\n \nThis erotic game is suitable for all couples regardless of their sexual orientation. Thus, each couple can spice-up their love life.  \n \nPleasure Machine is a game with erotic content and is for adults only. PLEASE DO NOT INSTALL IF YOU’RE UNDER 18.\n\nGame is also translated in Slovak, Czech and Polish language. You can set those languages directly in the game global settings."

What a sight!\n\nThe app has Siri Voice shortcuts, and they can be used to set your home into Away or Home state using Siri on your Watch or iPhone, as well as to display the live feeds from your cameras.\n\nThe app supports Apple Watch LTE, and can work when the iPhone is not around - as long as the watch itself has internet access (either LTE or WiFi).\n\nThe app is fully functional with an initial purchase. The in-app purchases are used only for giving a tip to the developer.\n\nWatch Cam lets you monitor all your Nest Cams from the Apple Watch or the iOS Widget.\n• From the watch face, tap on the Watch Cam complication to open the app. Swipe left and right to view life feeds from all your Nest Cams.\n• One of the watch complications shows you the snapshot from the camera of your choice, right on the watch face. The snapshot updates periodically all on its own, so you'll have a recent view of your camera any time you look at the watch. Useful when waiting for that package to arrive.\n• On your iOS device you can swipe to the widget panel to see what's on all of your cameras.\n• View the continuously updated Live Feed from the camera in the watch app, the iOS widget, or the iOS app. The feed updates with a new image approximately every second on the iOS and two seconds on the Watch - may be faster or slower, depending on your network speed.\n• Use the digital crown on the Watch to zoom in and out, or tap the screen to toggle zoom levels.\n• Use the pinch gesture on the camera views in the iOS app to zoom in and out. Single tap toggles the zoom level in the iOS app and the iOS widget.\n• Turn the device to landscape mode to increase the camera views sizes.\n• Double tap on the Live Feed view in the iOS app or the widget to launch the Nest app.\n• Set Geofence around your home to reliably set the Home and Away state when you come and go.\n\nWatch Face Complications can display the following:\n• Snapshot from the camera of your choice that updates periodically.\n• Status of all the cameras - if the camera icon is green, it means that all your cameras are online and streaming. If it's dimmed, it means that some cameras are off.\n\nYou can long-press the Watch screen for additional functions, like setting the home/away status, or turning the camera streaming on and off.\n\nWhile the app's minimalist looks betray the simplicity of its operation, what they don't show is the amount of planning, design, development and refinement that went into it, ensuring it becomes something that is enjoyable to use and experience.\n\nPlease Note: Watch Cam does not collect any of your data. Your login information, camera feeds, and any activity - all of it flows exclusively between your devices and Nest. Author of Watch Cam does not receive any of it, at any point.\nThis app and its developer are unaffiliated with Google Inc. or Google Nest. Nest is a trademark of Google Inc."

I can keep all my project counts in one place!\" - Anna706\n\n\"I do one project at a time that would require a counter. This is the first I’ve seen that is really easy! I love it!\" - nurse195829\n\n\"I am a totally blind knitter and use voiceover to read my iPhone screen. I have long wanted a row counter that was accessible to me. I found it! Works perfectly, and the sounds confirm that I have added or subtracted a row. The only thing that voiceover users want to know is that you need to double tap the pencil icon in order to make the project name text field active. This app is moving to the front page of my home screen! Thank you! Simplicity often means accessibility to me. Awesome!\" - ThaiFoodLady\n\n\"Its simplicity is great\" - hsbz. hsn \n\n\"i got it because i always forget to keep track of my stitches... it was so easy to use, i didn’t like the noise it made when you clicked it but i just turned it off. i also love how your able to choose what color you want!\" - milembh\n\n\"After trying several counter apps, this is by far by favorite.\" - H408\n\n\"I was looking for a counter app. Nothing fancy as I didn’t was one that took up a lot of memory on my device. Thus app is PERFECT. It’s super easy to use and a bit customizable too. If you are looking for a basic counter app, look no further. Thus app will meet your needs!\" - JB45840"

      "label": "Whether you are a professional Paranormal Investigator, a hobbyist or just want to have some fun, this app works like a \"Spirit Box\" reading data from your sensors and turning it into spoken words.\n\nWith a database of over a thousand commonly used words, Ghostalker will read changes in all of the sensors it can find in your device. This includes sensors for the tiniest amount of vibration, rotation, GPS, gyroscope, light, magnetic fields, proximity etc. and convert them to words which it will display and speak. This app uses the actual raw data from the sensors to determine what to say, rather than picking words at random like some other apps.\n\nLOGGING: This is the full version of the app so it logs the words spoken for you to view, save, email, delete etc. at a later time. There is also a built-in log viewer. The date and time is logged, along with the combined change in sensor readings (so you can see how big a change was picked up) and the word. The log files are in CSV format so you can import them into your favourite spreadsheet (e.g. MS Excel or Google Sheets).\n\nDICTIONARY: You can also manage your own custom dictionary of words so you can make your own special list of replies. You can flick between the in-built dictionary, your own custom dictionary or both combined (from v0.5) at any time.\n\nThis app is not designed to form complete sentences so it is up to you to interpret what it says in your own way. Top end phones and tablets tend to have more sensors than low end ones but the app is designed to work with whatever it can find. The sensitivity of sensors will also vary between devices.\n\nTIP 1: Using the custom dictionary you can have it reply with special limited words, for example 'yes', 'no' and 'maybe' when you ask it questions. Or add a series of digits and get it to pick your lottery numbers. Or add the letters of the alphabet so it can work like a Ouija board. \n\nTIP 2: Paranormal investigators believe that leaving such devices running for as long as possible will allow \"spirits\" to learn what energy is required to trigger certain words.\n\nTIP 3: If it starts to trigger words constantly you may be getting interference from something close by. Try moving the device somewhere else or tap the 'Calibrate' button to get it to tune out background variance (although you will lose some sensitivity).\n\nTIP 4: NEW - Keep lists of custom words in text files. Each word should be on its own line or separated by a space. Select all of the words and copy them to the clipboard. You can then import them into Ghostalker by pasting them from the clipboard. You can also copy word lists from the web, an email, or anywhere you can copy text.\n\nIf the app does not do what you were expecting, or there is an issue with it running on your device, please contact us for help.\n\nThere are no adverts in this software. If you would like to try the free version first (without the logging or custom dictionary functionality), it is listed under \"Ghostalker Lite\"."

Though we are not exactly sure how this process is done we know that it involves the modulation of sound waves in a manner that will change it’s characteristics on to a recording device.They may also communicate in real time (Opportunistic EVP). Simply put, spirits can change sounds in order to form speech and therefor have the ability to communicate.\n\nFeatures:\n4 sound Banks\nOptional Microphone input\nAudio effects that are fully adjustable including Echo, Reverb, Noise Gate, and Pitch.\n4 Band Equalizer\nVisual ITC feature that uses the first ever Virtual Video Feedback method.\n\nThis paranormal app is made to work similar to that of a ghost box by providing \"raw audio\" that spirits can use to form speech. This device can be put on your phone so you can have it with you, you never know when you might end up at a haunted location. You have to work on building a connection with the other side.

Purchasing the app is itself a tax deductible donation, and we greatly appreciate your support in keeping Falling Fruit online!\n\nOur global map of edible plants is not the first of its kind, but it aspires to be the world's most comprehensive. While our users contribute locations of their own, we comb the internet for pre-existing knowledge, seeking to unite the efforts of foragers, foresters, and freegans everywhere. Imported datasets range from small neighborhood foraging maps to vast professionally-compiled tree inventories. So far, this amounts to over 1,200 different edible types (most, but not all, plant species) distributed over nearly one million locations. Beyond the cultivated and commonplace to long-forgotten native plants and the exotic flavors of foreign plants, foraging in your neighborhood is a journey through time and across cultures.\n\nFalling Fruit is not associated with Fallen Fruit. Fallen Fruit can be found at fallenfruit.org."

Currently this includes an on-the-fly pitch tracker - so you can practise different ways of speaking and immediately see their effect - as well as unlimited archive space, celebrity comparison graphs, and a charting tool so you can track your progress over time.\n\nWe’re working to expand Vocular to other areas too. We want to cover things like smoothness, nasality, vocal fry, even creating a rating of how attractive your voice currently is, based on the latest research. If you want to get the most out of your vocal chords, this is the app for you."

He believes passionately that once the physical body dies, our spirit lives on. He has dedicated his life to his own spiritual development and teaching, as well as offering peace and comfort during times of loss and bereavement. “To see a group of students walk out of one of my workshops inspired, awakened, motivated, and energized is all the gratitude that I need,” John says. “If I somehow help them to start their own journey, then I’ve done my job.” \n\nAuthor of the bestsellers Power of the Soul, Born Knowing, Psychic Navigator, and 101 Ways to Jump-Start Your Intuition, John also hosted his own weekly radio show on Hay House Radio, Spirit Connections. He has become a familiar face on TV on programs such as the A&E special Mediums—We See Dead People, as well as appearing as a psychic authority on the History Channel’s Psychic History. John’s story was originally profiled on CBS’s Unsolved Mysteries. \n\nFor further information about John, to find out about his series of workshops and other events, or to sign up for his free email newsletter, visit: www.johnholland.com"

Depending on your location, the application choose the appropriate calculation method and Fiqhi school. \n\nFor an accurate location, please ensure that your location settings and your Internet connection or your GPS are enabled!\n\nNote about App features :\n-------------------------------\nIf you are familiar with Salatuk in other platforms please note that this version DOESN'T SUPPORT some features like \"Turn Phone to Silent after Athan\". Other features like \"Full Athan\" and \"Custom Athan\" are supported only when the app is ope. This is because of technical limitations. We will try to fix it once iOS system allows it.\n\nNote about Athan :\n-----------------\nSalatuk remind you that it's time for prayer with a \"4 takbeerats\" instead of full Athan. Because of technical limitations, it's possible to play full Athan only if the app is open. \n\nAlso, if you have problems to hear the notifications, please make sure to enable the following parameters in your device :\n\n1) Settings>Sounds>Alerts \n2) Settings>Notifications>Salatuk \n3) Your phone is not on mute and volume is correct\n\nNote about Prayers times :\n-----------------------------------\nPlease note that we pay attention to ensure that the prayer times of Salatuk are accurate. However, in some countries those times may be not exact. In this case, please refer to the official islamic institutions or mosques in your country and adjust manually the prayer times in the application settings.\n\nSalatuk supports currently 3 languages : Arabic, English and French.\n\nTips for a better usage\n-----------------------------\n\n1- In order to refresh the prayer alarms, make sure to open the application once a week. Please do so also when you change your location or timing (summer time).\n\n2- The prayer alarms corresponds to 2 or 4 Takbeerats. If you want to hear the complete Athan you should open the app at the moment of the Athan.\n\n**********************************************************************************\n\nتطبيق صلاتك رفيقك للحفاظ على صلاتك.\nعن طريق تحديد موقعك  تلقائيا، بإمكان هذا التطبيق أن يعلمك بأوقات الصلاة وكذلك تحديد اتجاه القبلة. تطبيق صلاتك يستعمل عددا مهما من الطرق الحسابية  المعتمدة في أغلب العالم الإسلامي. اعتمادا على موقعك، يختار التطبيق طريقة الحساب والمدرسة الفقهية المناسبة. \n\nحول خصائص التطبيق \n---------------------\nإذا كنت ممن يستعمل صلاتك على أنظمة أخرى، المرجو الانتباه إلى أن هذه النسخة لا تحتوي على بعض الخصائص مثل \"التحويل إلى الصامت\" كما أن بعض الخصائص الأخرى مثل \"الأذان الكامل\" و\"إضافة أذان من الذاكرة\" لا تشتغل إلا إذا كان التطبيق مفتوحا. يرجع ذلك إلى بعض القيود التقنية الموجودة حاليا في نظام أبل وسنحاول دعمها حالما ترفع هذه القيود.\n\n\nحول سماع الأذان \n---------------\nمن ناحية  أخرى إذا كان عندك مشكل في سماع التنبيهات، المرجو التاكد من أن الإعدادات التالية مفعلة في هاتفك : \n1) الإعدادات > الأصوات > تنبيهات التذكير\n2) الإعدادات >التنبيهات > صلاتك   \n3) هاتفك ليس في الوضع الصامت والصوت في مستوى جيد\n\nحول مواقيت الصلاة:\n-----------------\nننوه إلى أنه رغم المجهودات لتدقيق مواقيت الصلاة التي يقوم بها فريق صلاتك، إلا أنه في بعض البلدان قد تكون المواقيت غير مضبوطة بشكل تام، في هذه الحالة نرجو منكم الاعتماد على المواقيت الرسمية في بلدكم أو المسجد القريب منكم، مع العلم أنه يمكنكم تعديل الأوقات يدويا في نافذة الإعدادات.\n\nنصائح من أجل استعمال أفضل \n-------------------------\n\n1- حتى يتم تحديث إشعارات الأذان إحرص على فتح التطبيق مرة كل أسبوع على الأقل أو عندما تغير مكانك أو يتغير التوقيت في بلدك (التوقيت الصيفي)\n\n2- تطبيق صلاتك يشعرك بدخول وقت الصلاة على شكل تكبيرتين أو 4 تكبيرات. إذا أردت أن تستمع إلى الأذان كاملا المرجو أن تفتح التطبيق أثناء الأذان."

I was inspired to create this app while participating in the three year program of the Foundation for Shamanic Studies.\n\nNote: This app does not teach shamanic journey practices.

Based on ancient teachings and eternal realities, Yogananda explains that the whole physical universe, including man, is surrounded by, and made of cosmic energy. We can, through the act of our will, release tension that blocks the energy flow to our body and mind, and draw on this infinite storehouse of life-force all around us. Through daily use of these exercises we can systematically recharge our bodies with greater energy and train our minds to understand the true source of that power.\n\nThe full set of Energization Exercises is comprised of 39 individual exercises. Once you become familiar with the routine, it takes about 10–12 minutes to practice.\n\nFeatures include:\n\n- Diagrams of all of the exercises\n- Optional detailed or brief audio guide for each exercise\n- A Principles of Energization Exercises e-booklet (press the \"i\" info button in top right corner of second screen to access)\n- A counter to track your progress\n\nThe app is based on the book \"Energization Exercises\" from Crystal Clarity Publishers.\n\n“The whole purpose of true exercise is to awaken the inner source of energy which we have ignored throughout our lives.”\n                                    -- Paramhansa Yogananda"

Puddle & Pile will quickly learn your dog's toileting patterns and alert you before accidents happen.\nWhen your dog relieves, simply bring out your phone and record the action. Over just a few days Puddle & Pile will learn when your dog needs to be outside and it will bark, so you can save your floor! Consistently responding to puddles and piles alerts by giving your pooch a garden tour will help you toilet train your dog quickly.  Record every success or accident and see how quickly praise outweighs frustrations.\n\n\n- Or why not just use it to remind you even with older dogs that outside time is needed.\n- Customize the background with your favourite pooch picture. It's your dog's App!\n- Grow together with more positive times\n- Share your dog's history with others who may be looking after them.\n- Share your dog's history with your vet if there are strange patterns for an easy diagnosis.\n- Inspired by a continual puppy raiser for Guide Dogs Victoria.\n- Thank-you for the positive feedback. Please rate this app positively if you find it useful. It helps more than you may think. :-)\n- ENJOY YOUR DOG!\n\nREVIEWS\nIt works - byOttlight - Sep 26, 2015\nI've been having a problem house breaking my 4 1/2 old puppy. I started using this app and she was accident free the first day. It's very accurate nearly to the minute she has to go potty. I emailed the info to the puppy class trainer. It's very easy to use.\n\nFantastic App!  - byHot K - May 6, 2014\nI LOVE this app. I really needed something to help me make heads or tails out of mine & my new puppies day so we could have a smooth, fun house training process. Well, this app provides that! It certainly delivers what it promises & more! The app is easy to use & fun. It sorts out all the patterns of our new Sproodle & I feel less stressed. Def give this app a try if you haven't house trained a dog before, or maybe even if you have :)\n\nGreat tool!  - bymanwdaplan - Apr 24, 2014\nAmazingly accurate at predicting my dogs needs. Also, a very simple and clean (and cute) interface that makes the training process much less frustrating.\nLove this app! \n\nbyJonasfann1 - Apr 20, 2015 - Really very cool for any owner of a new puppy! LOVE using this app!!"

      "label": "VISUALIZE YOU\n\nLet’s face it. Losing weight is tough. Months of calorie counting, denial and exercise and no clear idea of what you’ll look like after all that hard work. Finally, after years of research with the Cleveland Clinic and the University of Colorado Anschutz Health and Wellness Center, comes the first scientifically accurate, photographic weight change app, Visualize You. Unlike conventional photo manipulations that stretch or pinch images, the Visualize You weight change viewer modifies the volume of your neck and face based upon clinically verified weight change dynamics. The resulting image of the new you is accurate, photorealistic and represents your specific target weight loss goal, whether modest or significant.  \n\nHOW IT WORKS\n\nIn three easy steps, the Visualize You app transforms your image to show the dramatic effects of weight loss.  Alternately, you can set a heavier target weight to see the negative effects of an unhealthy diet and lifestyle.  To get started, simply upload your photo from your library or use your smart phone to take a photo of your current self. Information guides imbedded in the app will help you take the best resulting image. After entering your height, weight, and desired target weight, define and adjust your image using the intuitive touch screen controls.  Hit the ‘next’ button and, voilà, the new you will appear on your phone, providing inspiration and motivation to reach your target weight loss goal. You can even save and send the new you image to your support team of family and friends who will encourage you to achieve your desired weight goal.\n\nACHIEVING THE NEW YOU\n\nStaying on track with weight loss and achieving your ideal weight is not easy.  It involves creating an eating plan that you can live with rather than just another diet. Regular exercise and the consumption of healthy foods can lead to a host of benefits, including increased energy, happiness, health and even a long life.  Exercise and diet are pivotal in determining a person’s overall health, and making them both a part of your lifestyle can make a dramatic difference in how you look and feel. Visualize You provides a host of weight loss topics and guides to help you reach and maintain your new you weight goal including:\n\nArthritis\nBlood Pressure & Heart\nCholesterol\nDental Issues\nDiabetes\nDigestive Issues\nEating Issues\nEmotional Issues\nHealth Issues\nJoints & Mobility\nSleep\nSocial Issues/ Self Esteem\nWhat’s in it for YOU"

The theory is that spirits can manipulate the sensors to choose the word that they wish to speak. The app sets a baseline for what is considered \"normal\" activity among the senors used. This baseline is then monitored for abnormal fluctations. To avoid having normal activity or handling disrupt the baseline we are using a modified version of a quantum fluctuation calculation that employs a new method with handling deltas. \n\nPlease note that the results of this application cannot be verified scientifically so this application is for entertainment purposes only."

So have fun. There are no rules.\n\nYou may search all plants, or use the filter to search for annuals, perennials or those grown in sun, shade or for foliage or flowers.  Scroll through any plant for useful information, swipe through hundreds of photos.  Add plants to your list of favorites, and email some of these to your friends or spouse so they will buy you the plant you actually are lusting for.  \n\nFor even more excitement, I have included videos where not only do I make a fool of myself, but may even teach you a few hints.  Have fun!\n\n\n••• About the Author •••\n\nWorld renown plantsman lecturer and author. He has traveled to gardens throughout Europe, South Africa, New Zealand, Japan, Australia, Canada, the Channel Island, and South America. He has appeared in International Horticulture conferences in Portugal, Toronto and Norway, chatted with Martha on the Martha Stewart Show and consulted with growers and nurseries around the globe. He has earned Professor Emeritus status within the Department of Horticulture at the University of Georgia. He has published 13 books, hundreds of trade journal articles for the horticulture industry, produced dozens of videos about plants for the gardener and is the author of an online course for the public.\n\nNative of Montreal, Canada, Dr. Armitage plays a mean guitar and enjoys hiking, skiing, and his weekly brutal games of squash and tennis.

The Aura Soma color-care-system® is a non intrusive, self selective, soul system.\n\n“Aura” means light, “Soma” means the body (Greek), or the being (Aramaic), or living energies (Sanskrit).　The Aura-Soma color care system connects the light to the body; it speaks of the being of light within and the living energies of light that surround us.\n\nCONSULTATION: Tap to make your selection of four Equilibrium bottles from a displayed set. Tap the bottles you’ve chosen and a message will appear.\nIn each bottle there are two color fractions. The messages of the colors are the doorways through which we understand the choice of bottles that has been made. Each color selection speaks of the superconscious recognition of the soul’s evolution, unique to that moment. – a recognition of the color code through time. \nThere is no difference between the consciousness that chooses, and the colors that are chosen.\n- First bottle: The Mission and Purpose\n- Second Bottle: The Gifts and Talents Bottle\n- Third bottle: Here and Now\n- Fourth bottle: Present Future\n\nNUMEROLOGY: Life Path Number (sometimes called the goal or lesson number) adding the birth date - relates to the subject’s circumstances rather than the person themselves. As this number is found from our birthdate, we can see how it can represent our circumstances, and what we can learn to express.\n\nLIBRARY: Includes 111 Equilibrium bottles and AURA-SOMA® New Aeon Tarot. Each bottle is compatible with numerology and tarot cards. The color therapy mode which reacts to the acceleration sensor will provide relaxation.\n\nThe Aura-Soma color-care-system® is continually being re-framed. It is about consciousness growth, bringing balance, ease and awareness to all levels of the body, mind and spirit, a means of moving towards positive well being and personal growth.\n\nLANGUAGE: English / Japanese / French / German / Italian / Spanish"

      "label": "Family tree research is becoming an ever more popular past time.  Normally all of your genealogy information is locked away on your computer at home which isn't much use when you are out and about researching local records, or visiting locations such as graveyards, ancestral homes, or family reunions.\n\nThis is where GedView comes in.  Carry around your entire family tree on your iPhone, iPod, or iPad and have all the data about your ancestors and even current descendants at your fingertips.\n\nYou can quickly check up on family relationships, dates / locations of events, and record new information.  Despite the name GedView is not just a viewing tool.  This includes taking photos, or video anywhere and anytime you like without needing to worry about a potentially costly internet connection.   If using an iPhone, or a cellular enabled iPad you can even record your current location to add to any event.\n\nIf your tree contains lots of images you can even use GedView as a slideshow, showing all the pictures related to a given event, person, source, family.  You can also play back any home movies you have in your tree.  Media support is not limited to photos/video.  Support is also included for any other file type your iPhone, iPod, or iPad is capable of opening.  This may be PDFs, Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, mp3 files.  If you have an app installed that supports a specific document type and have a document of that type in your tree you will be able to view it via GedView.\n\nDo you have some separate branches in your tree that you haven't connected yet?  GedView allows you to store multiple trees so you can easily switch to view distinct branches.\n\nUnlike other apps no specific computer application is required, nor is a subscription to any website.  Instead standard GEDCOM files can be imported,  These can be encoded as ASCII, ANSI, ANSEL, UTF-8, or UTF-16 and can be added to GedView via WiFi, downloading from a website, via iTunes, or even opened from other apps such as Mail, Safari, Dropbox etc.\n\nWhile GedView is targeted towards GEDCOM 5.5.1 it will read in any version, and will also support many custom extensions used by other genealogy applications, and because GEDCOM hasn't been added as an after thought imports are fast and efficient.\n\nYou can even export GEDCOM files for sharing with family members or other researchers, or to transfer new information to your main computer.\n\nA sample family tree containing the British monarchy is included.\n\nIf you have any problems, or suggestions please get in touch via the support email address."

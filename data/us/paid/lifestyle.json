When a response is detected by the app the words will show visually in the text box along with audible speech.\n\nWhen you have finished your session just click stop. You can also look back at the responses you received during your session by clicking on the folder button (this only works when the scanner is \"Stopped\").\n\nThe EMF Meter only works if your device has a Magnetometer Sensor.

      "label": "The FOUNDATION FOR INNER PEACE, original publisher of \"A Course in Miracles,\" has joined with CDE Solutions to produce this app as an aid to those working on their daily lessons from the Workbook of the Course. -- NOW AVAILABLE IN 5 LANGUAGES: English, French, German, Portuguese and Spanish. As a student of the Course have you ever spent time studying your lesson in the morning only to forget to review it at the suggested time intervals during the day? Have you ever wished that you had reminders, preset at the required time intervals, to jog your memory? Have you ever remembered to review a lesson but forgot what words to use? If so, then this app is for you!\n\nIn addition to providing convenient access to the full text of the 365 daily lessons from the Course's \"Workbook for Students,\" THIS APP HAS BUILT-IN REMINDER ALERTS which have been preset with specific text to be remembered for the day and the time intervals as suggested within the lessons of the Workbook. For lessons that have no suggested time intervals, you can select a time interval of your choice. You can even override Course specified intervals to time intervals of your choice that fit in with your daily schedule. The app is simple to use. To begin you would select the lesson you are currently working on from a rotating \"wheel,\" then when the wheel stops on your lesson of the day you click on \"Full Text\" and you are presented with the full text of the lesson. Once your beginning lesson has been selected you will be presented with the same lesson when you return the next day. This allows you review the previous lesson, or move on to your daily lesson. The complete Workbook, including Introductions, can be accessed from the wheel. During the day, shortened text (the words suggested within the Workbook lesson to be used as the reminder that day) is presented when the reminder alert is sounded. These words can be changed to whatever words you would prefer to use instead. In addition, you can choose what sound you’d like to hear as a reminder, when you want the reminder to start, and when you want it to end.\n\nYou purchase the app ONLY ONCE for all devices.\n\nAbout \"A Course in Miracles\":\n\nThe Course’s teaching is based on the practice of forgiveness as the key to inner peace and the remembrance of God. While the app contains the text of the complete \"Workbook for Students\", it represents only part of the Course, a unique self-study metaphysical thought system.\n\nPublished in one volume, \"A Course in Miracles\" consists of three separate sections: \"Text\", \"Workbook for Students\" and the \"Manual for Teachers\". The \"Text\" section of the Course sets forth the theoretical concepts of the Course's thought system and thus provides the necessary framework to clarify the meaning of the \"Workbook\" exercises. It is therefore important to undertake the lessons in this app in conjunction with the writings within \"A Course in Miracles\".\n\n\"A Course in Miracles\" was received in its entirety over a period of seven years by psychologist Dr. Helen Schucman through an inspired process she described as scribing. In 1975 the Foundation for Inner Peace, co-publisher of this app, was chosen by Dr. Schucman to be the publisher of the only original edition of \"A Course in Miracles\".\n\nThe \"Workbook for Students\", contained in this app, includes 365 lessons which are designed to train your mind in a systematic way to a different perception of everyone and everything in the world. As stated in the Introduction to the Workbook: “The exercises are very simple. They do not require a great deal of time, and it does not matter where you do them. They need no preparation.” You are asked only not to undertake to do more than one exercise a day. You might however choose to remain with a particularly appealing lesson for more than one day."

      "label": "Ravit is a fun app that enables you to discover inspirational patterns and yarns, update your projects and stash and browse and post to Ravelry forums from anywhere. It's super quick, and it's friendly. Ravelry on mobile has never been easier.\n\nFIND INSPIRATIONAL PATTERNS\nIf you’re not sure what you’d like to make next, Ravit lets you easily browse patterns, favorite them, download and view pattern PDFs, view project photos and browse a designer’s other patterns and pattern suggestions. \n\nAnd if you want to narrow your search, choose from dozens of filters including craft, availability, category, attributes, needles, weight and more. You can even combine multiple options with AND, NOT or OR. It's powerful, but easy.\n\nThere's so many beautiful patterns on Ravelry, and Ravit helps you find them easily.\n\nTAKE RAVELRY TO YOUR YARN STORE\nFind out which yarns you’ll need for a project. Check what yardage you need. Look in your stash to see if you’ve already got a yarn, or one that’s similar. And because Ravit is designed to work nicely on your iPhone or iPad with readable text and buttons you can tap, you won't be squinting as you find all the info you need when you're at your LYS.\n\n+ Search all yarns by keyword, filter by fiber, weight, attributes and many others, and sort by options including 'Most projects' and 'Highest rating'. Quickly view pattern suggestions and projects for a yarn.\n\n+ Access your stash offline. No wireless or cell signal in your yarn store? No problem! Your stash is cached on your device so you can search, sort and view your stash offline.\n\nSNAP, EDIT AND UPLOAD ON THE SPOT\nPerhaps you're making a project on the train to work, or relaxed on the couch at home - whenever you are inspired to share your WIPs, Ravit makes it easy to snap photos, enhance with powerful photo filters, and upload to Ravelry, all from the one app.\n\n+ Powerful Photo Editing Tools - enhance, crop, and adjust your photos before your upload and show your work in it's best possible light. You can remove blemishes, improve color balance, sharpen images and access many other pro editing tools all from within the app.\n\n+ Optimized for Ravelry - before images are uploaded, they're resized optimally for Ravelry, so you'll upload smaller photos (up to 10x smaller!) more quickly and using less data.\n\n+ More than just photos - you can update notes for your Projects, Queued Projects and Stash, as well as most of the other info such as yarns, yardage, skeins, colorways, and color for your stash, and progress, link to stash, rating, craft, and tags amongst others for your projects.\n\nIT'S ALL THE LITTLE THINGS...\nSo why use Ravit? It's all the the little, sometimes hidden touches which make Ravit shine. Here's a few of them.\n\n+ It's quick - if you tap on something, you go right there. \n\n+ Infinite scroll - smooth, continuous scrolling as you browse to find inspiration.\n\n+ Offline - whether you're commuting underground, or you're off-grid, Ravit lets you access your Projects and Stash offline.\n\n+ Clean, uncluttered interface - we want your work and the beauty of Ravelry.com to shine. \n\n+ Use up to 50%* less data in Ravit compared with your web browser. \n\n+ Squint less - The text in Ravit isn't made super small, and we're fully Dynamic Type compatible, so if you change the font size on your device, it'll change in Ravit.\n\n* Based on tests of browsing patterns, projects, stash and yarns on Ravit and Safari on the same device - YYMV! (Your Yardage May Vary)\n\nTHIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING\nRavit has many features already, but we are constantly enhancing and adding more features. We have an active group on Ravelry and we'd love to hear what you'd like to see next - join in the discussion at http://www.ravelry.com/groups/ravit\n\nRavit is not affiliated with ravelry.com. It is an independent app, developed by a husband and wife team. You can read more about why we made Ravit at http://www.enhancient.com/ravit\n\nDownload Ravit now and hop on to Ravelry."

It fully supports Apple Watch LTE, and can work when the iPhone is not around - as long as the watch itself has internet access (either LTE or WiFi).\n\n＊ The app lets you monitor and control HomeKit thermostats like Ecobee, and functions largely the same with them as it does with Nest, except for the Siri Shortcuts functionality which is not needed with HomeKit. It lets you see your thermostat info on the Watch complications, and control it using the iOS widget.\n_____________\n\n• Using Siri voice shortcuts you can control many aspects of your Nest, such as instant activation of heating or cooling, setting the temperature by saying how many degrees you want to set, increasing/decreasing the temperature, and setting the Home/Away state. Thanks to Thermo Watch, It's all finally just one casual \"Hey Siri\" away, all with informative visual and verbal feedback.\n• From the watch face, tap on the Thermo Watch complication to open the app. Spin the Digital Crown, or Swipe up/down to adjust the temperature. You can start adjusting the moment the app opens.\n• On your iOS device you can see the thermostat info on the home screen widget, you can swipe to the widget panel to adjust the temperature on the interactive widget, or you can just open the app. Again, you can start adjusting the moment the controls appear.\n• From your Apple TV, open the app, and swipe up/down on the remote to change the temperate.\n\nThe app is fully functional with an initial purchase. The in-app purchases are used only for giving a tip to the developer.\n\nThe app will let you know with a chime and a tap, that the thermostat has received and applied your command.\n\nMonitor your Thermostats and Home/Away status right from the watch face, using complications that update in the background, without having to launch the app.\n\nYou can use Siri on your iPhone, Watch, iPad, or HomePod to control any of your thermostats. Record phrases that make most sense to you, such as \"Start Heating\" or \"Make it Cooler\". If you have multiple thermostats you can control them individually, by saying for example \"Start Heating Upstairs\" or \"Start Cooling the Living Room\".\n\nVisit https://thermowatch.net/siri website for the detailed instructions of Siri operation.\n\nSet Geofence around your home to reliably set the Home and Away state when you come and go.\n\nThe app supports multiple thermostats in multiple homes - just swipe left and right on your Watch screen to access them, or see them all at the same time in the iOS Widget and the app. Fahrenheit and Celsius are both supported.\n\nBeyond that, you can press the Watch screen firmly for additional functions, like switching to a heating or cooling mode, setting the away status, choosing the active temperature sensor, or turning the fan on and off.\n\nWhile the app's minimalist looks betray the simplicity of its operation, what they don't show is the amount of planning, design, development and refinement that went into it, ensuring it becomes something that is enjoyable to use and experience.\n\nThermo Watch does not collect any of your data. Your login information, thermostat settings, and any activity - all of it flows exclusively between your devices and Nest. Author of Thermo Watch does not receive any of it, at any point.\nThis app and its developer are unaffiliated with Google Inc. or Google Nest. Nest is a trademark of Google Inc."

      "label": "The Secret to Money is an app that is designed to change the way you think about money, and to radically change the circumstances of money in your life.\n\nInspired by Rhonda Byrne's worldwide best selling phenomenon, The Secret, in this app you will develop a whole new perspective on your own personal finances and potential to live a life of abundance.\n\nThe Secret to Money is a personal development program of games and daily activities created by Rhonda Byrne herself, featuring 6 powerful Secret-inspired practices that will help you develop a wealth mindset:\n\nDESIRES\nPURCHASES\nMANIFESTED MONEY\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS\nAFFIRMATIONS\nGIVING\n\nDESIRES: In this practice, you create a list of 7 things you would buy if money were no object. This \"Secret\" list reminds you of why you want more money in your life, and what it would actually feel like to have the things you desire most.\n\nPURCHASES: In this practice, you will change your mindset about money by spending large amounts of money in your imagination. Every day, you will receive virtual checks in escalating amounts from the Bank of the Universe, as first introduced in The Secret book. Using your imagination, you “spend” each check on whatever you want or need, and record these purchases within the app. Currencies are localised for each country and set according to the language and location setting on the phone or tablet.\n\nMANIFESTED MONEY: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have manifested money today - money you have received, saved, were gifted or refunded. You will be surprised by how much \"Secret\" money you begin to manifest every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS: When it comes to money, a little bit of inspiration goes a long way towards increasing the money in your life. In this daily practice, you will receive inspiring, financially themed messages drawn from The Secret books in order to help you change the way you think about money. Each inspiration is available to share.\n\nAFFIRMATIONS: Affirmations are positive statements that you make to create a positive mindset and change your life on a particular subject. In this daily practice, you will read 25 unique affirmations of wealth and abundance inspired by The Secret to help change your money mindset.\n\nGIVING: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have given to others - charitable donations, tips, gifts and giveaways, covering the check at dinner, or buying coffee for a friend.  You will be surprised by how much you give to others every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nThe Secret to Money was designed specifically for you as your invitation to use The Secret in order to live the life of your dreams. As Rhonda says herself:\n\n\"Like many people, I was brought up with the belief that money is hard to come by, and that you have to work really hard for money. I even had the belief that I would never have much money because my family didn’t have money.\n\n\"All these beliefs came from just one belief – a belief in a lack of money.\n\n\"So, in 2004, while researching for The Secret film, I created many different money practices and invented lots of imaginary money games in order to change my belief in a lack of money to a belief in an abundance of money. I committed to these practices, and did them every day. And today, there is no lack in my life whatsoever.\n\n\"The Secret team has taken my life-changing money practices that took me from lack to abundance and put them into The Secret to Money App. The App is simple, practical, and designed to radically change the circumstances of money in your life, as it did for me.\"\n\nAvailable in English, Spanish, German, French, Japanese, Korean, Hindi and Mandarin."

With its large, highly visible font, you can check the time even from a distance. Also, in everyday life and at work, its modest matt black presence does not distract you or disrupt your productivity, even when using the app for extended periods of time. Its full-screen appearance integrates with the iPhone/iPad device body and blends into your living space ambience, as if it were a minimalist home decor item.\n\nFEATURES:\n- Switch between 12/24 hour clock\n- Switch between portrait and landscape mode\n- Option to show seconds when tapping screen\n- Brightness/dimness control inside the app\n- Show/hide background tiles\n- Enlarge/reduce to any size\n\nNOTES:\n- Your device’s Auto-Lock is disabled while this clock is active in the foreground.\n- This app does not start automatically like the Mac screensaver.\n- You cannot replace your device’s Lock Screen with this clock."

      "label": "After many years of researching sensor data for lots of different types of paranormal apps, I have concluded that the best way for Spirits to manipulate a device (or the device sensors) is by keeping it simple and universal across the whole world.\n\nThe Spirit Music Box works similar to the world famous Para4ce device, but this uses a lot more sensors and is more complex!\n\nIf any of the sensors pick up a change then the Music Box will start playing an old eerie music box song.\n\nSimply place the device in any area, click the \"Calibrate\" button then move away from the device. If you move the device after it has been calibrated you will need to recalibrate, simply click the \"Back\" button, move the device to a new area, then click \"Calibrate\" again.\n\nThere are 12 music box songs that his app randomly chooses from when it calibrates.\n\nThe sensors used are:\n\nMagnetometer - This senses Magnetic and Electromagnet fields around the device\nAccelerometer - This senses any device movement and the slightest vibrations around the device\nBarometer - Detects any change in the Ambient Air Pressure around the device\nCompass - Detects the slightest change in magnetic interference to Magnetic North\nGyroScope - Detects the slightest movement of the device\nOrientation - Detects the slightest movement to the position of the device\n\nIf your device is missing any sensors, the app will still work perfectly well without them.\n\n\n** Disclaimer **\n\nUse at your own risk, I cannot be held personally responsible for you or any outcome (paranormal or otherwise) from using this app!"

This app is moving to the front page of my home screen! Thank you! Simplicity often means accessibility to me.

From Polynesian (Tahitian, Samoan, Tongan, etc.) tatau. In Marquesan, tatu.\" Before the importation of the Polynesian word, the practice of tattooing had been described in the West as pricking, painting, or staining. Sailors on the voyage later introduced both the word and reintroduced the concept of tattooing to Europe.\n\nThis is not to be confused with the origins of the word for the military drumbeat — see military tattoo. In this case, the English word tattoo is derived from the Dutch word taptoe (OED).\n\nThe first written reference to the word tattoo (or tatau), appears in the journal of Joseph Banks (24 February 1743 – 19 June 1820), the naturalist aboard Captain Cook's ship the HMS Endeavour: \"I shall now mention the way they mark themselves indelibly, each of them is so marked by their humor or disposition\".\n\nThe word \"tattoo\" was brought to Europe by the explorer James Cook, when he returned in 1771 from his first voyage to Tahiti and New Zealand. In his narrative of the voyage, he refers to an operation called \"tattaw\". Before this it had been described as scarring, painting, or staining\n\nTattoo enthusiasts may refer to tattoos as \"ink\", \"pieces\", \"skin art\", \"tattoo art\", \"tats\", or \"work\"; to the creators as \"tattoo artists\", \"tattooers\", or \"tattooists\"; and to places where they work as \"tattoo shops\", \"tattoo studios\", or \"tattoo parlors\".\n\n\nA tattooed man's back, Japan, c. 1875\nUsage of the terms \"skin art\", \"tattoo art\", \"pieces\", and work\" is gaining greater support,[citation needed] with mainstream art galleries holding exhibitions of both conventional and custom tattoo designs. Beyond Skin, at the Museum of Croydon, is an example of this as it challenges the stereotypical view of tattoos and who has them. Copyrighted tattoo designs that are mass-produced and sent to tattoo artists are known as \"flash\", a notable instance of industrial design. Flash sheets are prominently displayed in many tattoo parlors for the purpose of providing both inspiration and ready-made tattoo images to customers.\n\nThe Japanese word irezumi means \"insertion of ink\" and can mean tattoos using tebori, the traditional Japanese hand method, a Western-style machine, or for that matter, any method of tattooing using insertion of ink. The most common word used for traditional Japanese tattoo designs is Horimono. Japanese may use the word \"tattoo\" to mean non-Japanese styles of tattooing."

Depending on your location, the application choose the appropriate calculation method and Fiqhi school. \n\nFor an accurate location, please ensure that your location settings and your Internet connection or your GPS are enabled!\n\nNote about App features :\n-------------------------------\nIf you are familiar with Salatuk in other platforms please note that this version DOESN'T SUPPORT some features like \"Turn Phone to Silent after Athan\". Other features like \"Full Athan\" and \"Custom Athan\" are supported only when the app is ope. This is because of technical limitations. We will try to fix it once iOS system allows it.\n\nNote about Athan :\n-----------------\nSalatuk remind you that it's time for prayer with a \"4 takbeerats\" instead of full Athan. Because of technical limitations, it's possible to play full Athan only if the app is open. \n\nAlso, if you have problems to hear the notifications, please make sure to enable the following parameters in your device :\n\n1) Settings>Sounds>Alerts \n2) Settings>Notifications>Salatuk \n3) Your phone is not on mute and volume is correct\n\nNote about Prayers times :\n-----------------------------------\nPlease note that we pay attention to ensure that the prayer times of Salatuk are accurate. However, in some countries those times may be not exact. In this case, please refer to the official islamic institutions or mosques in your country and adjust manually the prayer times in the application settings.\n\nSalatuk supports currently 3 languages : Arabic, English and French.\n\nTips for a better usage\n-----------------------------\n\n1- In order to refresh the prayer alarms, make sure to open the application once a week. Please do so also when you change your location or timing (summer time).\n\n2- The prayer alarms corresponds to 2 or 4 Takbeerats.

What a sight!\n\nThe app has Siri Voice shortcuts, and they can be used to set your home into Away or Home state using Siri on your Watch or iPhone, as well as to display the live feeds from your cameras.\n\nThe app supports Apple Watch LTE, and can work when the iPhone is not around - as long as the watch itself has internet access (either LTE or WiFi).\n\nThe app is fully functional with an initial purchase. The in-app purchases are used only for giving a tip to the developer.\n\nWatch Cam lets you monitor all your Nest Cams from the Apple Watch or the iOS Widget.\n• From the watch face, tap on the Watch Cam complication to open the app. Swipe left and right to view life feeds from all your Nest Cams.\n• One of the watch complications shows you the snapshot from the camera of your choice, right on the watch face. The snapshot updates periodically all on its own, so you'll have a recent view of your camera any time you look at the watch. Useful when waiting for that package to arrive.\n• On your iOS device you can swipe to the widget panel to see what's on all of your cameras.\n• View the continuously updated Live Feed from the camera in the watch app, the iOS widget, or the iOS app. The feed updates with a new image approximately every second on the iOS and two seconds on the Watch - may be faster or slower, depending on your network speed.\n• Use the digital crown on the Watch to zoom in and out, or tap the screen to toggle zoom levels.\n• Use the pinch gesture on the camera views in the iOS app to zoom in and out. Single tap toggles the zoom level in the iOS app and the iOS widget.\n• Turn the device to landscape mode to increase the camera views sizes.\n• Double tap on the Live Feed view in the iOS app or the widget to launch the Nest app.\n• Set Geofence around your home to reliably set the Home and Away state when you come and go.\n\nWatch Face Complications can display the following:\n• Snapshot from the camera of your choice that updates periodically.\n• Status of all the cameras - if the camera icon is green, it means that all your cameras are online and streaming. If it's dimmed, it means that some cameras are off.\n\nYou can long-press the Watch screen for additional functions, like setting the home/away status, or turning the camera streaming on and off.\n\nWhile the app's minimalist looks betray the simplicity of its operation, what they don't show is the amount of planning, design, development and refinement that went into it, ensuring it becomes something that is enjoyable to use and experience.\n\nPlease Note: Watch Cam does not collect any of your data. Your login information, camera feeds, and any activity - all of it flows exclusively between your devices and Nest. Author of Watch Cam does not receive any of it, at any point.\nThis app and its developer are unaffiliated with Google Inc. or Google Nest. Nest is a trademark of Google Inc."

A summary will show the length of the track, number of markers and the time it took for you to walk the track.\n\nWhen your dog walks the track Dog Track will draw a new track on the map and automatically mark the markers your dog finds. You will see the track you walked and in real time follow your dog's track.\n\nAfter you and your dog have walked the track you will see a map that shows both tracks, which marker your dog has found, track length and time. You can log weather and wind conditions and also write your own comments.\n\nDog Track requires that Location service, GPS and Mobile Data is enabled on your phone.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

Currently this includes an on-the-fly pitch tracker - so you can practise different ways of speaking and immediately see their effect - as well as unlimited archive space, celebrity comparison graphs, and a charting tool so you can track your progress over time.\n\nWe’re working to expand Vocular to other areas too.

Though we are not exactly sure how this process is done we know that it involves the modulation of sound waves in a manner that will change it’s characteristics on to a recording device.They may also communicate in real time (Opportunistic EVP). Simply put, spirits can change sounds in order to form speech and therefor have the ability to communicate.\n\nFeatures:\n4 sound Banks\nOptional Microphone input\nAudio effects that are fully adjustable including Echo, Reverb, Noise Gate, and Pitch.\n4 Band Equalizer\nVisual ITC feature that uses the first ever Virtual Video Feedback method.\n\nThis paranormal app is made to work similar to that of a ghost box by providing \"raw audio\" that spirits can use to form speech. This device can be put on your phone so you can have it with you, you never know when you might end up at a haunted location. You have to work on building a connection with the other side. This will help improve your communication. \nDisclaimer:\nThere is no guarantee you will be able to communicate with spirits or ghosts. Results may vary. Use at your own risk."

Watch live video and talk to your dog or puppy remotely from your iPhone or iPad. Keep your pet happy even if you are not at home.  Drop in every now and then to say hello, to soothe your dog from separation anxiety, or to continue with the puppy training.\n\nPICTURE IN PICTURE\nKeep an eye on your furry friend via live Picture in Picture monitoring while multitasking on your device.\n\nRECORD VIDEOS, SNAP PHOTOS\nDo not miss any important moments from your pet friend‘s life.

      "label": "The B-hyve Pro App provides landscape irrigation professionals with an easy way to manage and operate B-hyve Pro controllers from anywhere with the convenience of a smart phone or tablet.  With the intuitive layout and design of the app, it is fast and easy to connect to any B-hyve Pro controller through WiFi or, if WiFi is not available, directly through Bluetooth right at the timer location.  Once connected to WiFi, B-hyve can be set up in smart mode to assist in delivering the right amount of water to plants, saving clients water and money.\nThis is the companion App for award-winning B-hyve Pro irrigation controllers. Homeowners can download the non-Pro version of the B-hyve App at no charge.\n\n***KEY FEATURES***\nWIFI and BLUETOOTH – Because WiFi is not always available on a job site, the B-hyve app and controller allow you to set up and operate the controller using Bluetooth. Once a WiFi connection is established at a site, the owner of the WiFi router can provide a permission code that enables off-site management of the controller from anywhere in the world.\n\nEPA- AND SWAT-CERTIFIED – Having passed the rigorous EPA WaterSense and SWAT certifications, the B-hyve Pro Controller with Smart Watering is certified to use water more efficiently and is eligible for rebates in many cities or water districts across the country.\n\nFLEXIBLE SCHEDULING – You can set the controller to water in two basic ways: 1) on a fixed schedule, such as during a new landscape grow-in period; 2) with Smart Watering, and let local weather conditions determine the schedule.\n\nMULTI-SITE MANAGEMENT – You can manage and control an unlimited number of B-hyve controllers from the convenience of one application.  Once the timer is connected to the Internet, secure access can be shared in a number of different combinations using an app-generated code.\n\nCATCH CUPS – With various water savings options integrated right into the app, there are multiple ways to achieve optimum water savings with the B-hyve Pro Timer.  In addition to Smart Watering, it incorporates the award-winning catch-cup feature right into the app to deliver up to 25% more water savings over other smart controllers.\n\nALEXA – Works with Alexa.

      "label": "QuiltPaper creates graph paper for quilters. More than just a 1/4” grid — a tap does much of the ‘drafting' needed for quilt design by adding borders, sashing, cornerstones, diagonals for triangles, and more.\n\nStandard graph paper grids are included. For example, design an on-point quilt by starting with included Diagonal Paper. Make your own expensive, hard-to-find specialty papers and EPP templates: hexagon, diamond, triangle, HST & HRT templates, tumbler, polygon, eight and six point star, honeycomb (Lucy Boston), jewel, kite, brick, log cabin, square, circle, arc, and pinwheel by adding InApp purchases.\n\nQuiltPaper also makes it easy to work with inspiration images because you can place an image ‘just so’ under a grid by adjusting the image to fit!\n\nOnce a setting is complete, the design can be brought into the Paint Tool (with the inspiration image!) for coloring with solids and textures. While there is an extensive color palette available, unlimited custom color palettes can be created by — \n• Taking colors from images or live camera\n• Setting RGB or HSB codes\n• Selecting colors on the color wheel\n\nNOTE — If you are looking for a quilt block library, you will not find one here. QuiltPaper app is for quilters who use a grid to plan and design a quilt. It is worth mentioning, however, that a few in-app purchase papers use a Pattern Planner tool that offers at least a minimum level of block planning. These papers are Pinwheel, Arc, and Log Cabin.\n\nEnjoy English Paper Piecing? \nMake your own EPP templates. QuiltPaper can create shapes at the exact size you need for your project. You can even place a circle at the center of each template to cut a hole for easier paper removal. Once the template page is set, it can be — \n•Printed to cut templates by hand\n•Exported as a PDF or SVG to laser and pattern cutting machines\n\nHST & HRT paper (InApp purchase) lets you make your own at the exact size you want — \n• HST. Set overall size and seam allowance for template.\n• HRT. Set overall size and seam allowance for template with trimmed corners for easier, accurate matching during assembly (no ‘dog ears’).\n\nPURCHASE INCLUDES 3 PAPERS:\nGRID — Classic grid graph paper taken up a notch! \nDOT— Choice of 5 dot styles and 2 dot patterns.\nDIAGONAL — On-point design graph paper.\n\n— FEATURES OF ALL PAPERS —\n√  Buy once — purchase works on all devices — iPhone, iPad, iPod.\n√  Metric (cm or mm) and Inch settings for grid and page size. \n√  Paint quilt layout with color and pattern. Make your own color palettes.\n√  Place an inspiration image under any grid, then adjust size and placement.\n√  Up to four line colors on a grid.\n√  Put multiple grids on a page to plan block designs, assembly, etc.\n√  Title grid with choice of font, size, bold or italic, and color.\n√  Print on standard sized page (such as 8.5x11 or A4) or set a custom size.\n√  Avoid the headache of scaling a design by setting the page at the quilt actual size by using ‘Custom’ page size setting.\n√  Library of Quick Pick templates offer inspiration  and a short cut to creating layouts.\n√  Print or share grids as a PDF, PNG or SVG to other apps for further editing — even as templates to laser or pattern cutting machines.\n√  Share painted grids as a PNG or PDF. \n√  Work up close using pinch-n-zoom gesture.\n√  Place a center-point on most papers. \n\nIN-APP PURCHASES unlock specialty papers: \nTriangle\nHST & HRT\nTumbler\nDiamond\nPolygon (especially helpful to make shapes for EPP)\nHexagon\nHoneycomb (Lucy Boston)\n8 point star (Lone Star)\n6 point star\nLog Cabin\nJewel\nJewel Ring\nKite\nBrick\nSquare\nCircle\nArc\nPinwheel\n\n• ‘All Papers Forever’ bundle. For the price of five papers get them all! \nCredit is given for earlier purchases. On purchase of a fifth paper the bundle is instantly added.\n\nDon’t see the paper you need?

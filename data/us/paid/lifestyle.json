When a response is detected by the app the words will show visually in the text box along with audible speech.\n\nWhen you have finished your session just click stop. You can also look back at the responses you received during your session by clicking on the folder button (this only works when the scanner is \"Stopped\").\n\nThe EMF Meter only works if your device has a Magnetometer Sensor. If not then the EMF Meter won't be displayed. Please check the compatibility of your phone / tablet.\n\n** Disclaimer **\nUse at your own risk.

      "label": "The FOUNDATION FOR INNER PEACE, original publisher of \"A Course in Miracles,\" has joined with CDE Solutions to produce this app as an aid to those working on their daily lessons from the Workbook of the Course. -- NOW AVAILABLE IN 5 LANGUAGES: English, French, German, Portuguese and Spanish. As a student of the Course have you ever spent time studying your lesson in the morning only to forget to review it at the suggested time intervals during the day? Have you ever wished that you had reminders, preset at the required time intervals, to jog your memory? Have you ever remembered to review a lesson but forgot what words to use? If so, then this app is for you!\n\nIn addition to providing convenient access to the full text of the 365 daily lessons from the Course's \"Workbook for Students,\" THIS APP HAS BUILT-IN REMINDER ALERTS which have been preset with specific text to be remembered for the day and the time intervals as suggested within the lessons of the Workbook. For lessons that have no suggested time intervals, you can select a time interval of your choice. You can even override Course specified intervals to time intervals of your choice that fit in with your daily schedule. The app is simple to use. To begin you would select the lesson you are currently working on from a rotating \"wheel,\" then when the wheel stops on your lesson of the day you click on \"Full Text\" and you are presented with the full text of the lesson. Once your beginning lesson has been selected you will be presented with the same lesson when you return the next day. This allows you review the previous lesson, or move on to your daily lesson. The complete Workbook, including Introductions, can be accessed from the wheel. During the day, shortened text (the words suggested within the Workbook lesson to be used as the reminder that day) is presented when the reminder alert is sounded. These words can be changed to whatever words you would prefer to use instead. In addition, you can choose what sound you’d like to hear as a reminder, when you want the reminder to start, and when you want it to end.\n\nYou purchase the app ONLY ONCE for all devices.\n\nAbout \"A Course in Miracles\":\n\nThe Course’s teaching is based on the practice of forgiveness as the key to inner peace and the remembrance of God. While the app contains the text of the complete \"Workbook for Students\", it represents only part of the Course, a unique self-study metaphysical thought system.\n\nPublished in one volume, \"A Course in Miracles\" consists of three separate sections: \"Text\", \"Workbook for Students\" and the \"Manual for Teachers\". The \"Text\" section of the Course sets forth the theoretical concepts of the Course's thought system and thus provides the necessary framework to clarify the meaning of the \"Workbook\" exercises. It is therefore important to undertake the lessons in this app in conjunction with the writings within \"A Course in Miracles\".\n\n\"A Course in Miracles\" was received in its entirety over a period of seven years by psychologist Dr. Helen Schucman through an inspired process she described as scribing. In 1975 the Foundation for Inner Peace, co-publisher of this app, was chosen by Dr. Schucman to be the publisher of the only original edition of \"A Course in Miracles\".\n\nThe \"Workbook for Students\", contained in this app, includes 365 lessons which are designed to train your mind in a systematic way to a different perception of everyone and everything in the world. As stated in the Introduction to the Workbook: “The exercises are very simple. They do not require a great deal of time, and it does not matter where you do them. They need no preparation.” You are asked only not to undertake to do more than one exercise a day. You might however choose to remain with a particularly appealing lesson for more than one day."

      "label": "Apple Watch, Nest Thermostat, and Siri. Together at last.\n\n＊ The app has Siri Voice shortcuts for seamless Siri control of your Nest, from the iPhone, Watch, iPad, and HomePod. It fully supports Apple Watch LTE, and can work when the iPhone is not around - as long as the watch itself has internet access (either LTE or WiFi).\n\n＊ The app lets you monitor and control HomeKit thermostats like Ecobee, and functions largely the same with them as it does with Nest, except for the Siri Shortcuts functionality which is not needed with HomeKit. It lets you see your thermostat info on the Watch complications, and control it using the iOS widget.\n_____________\n\n• Using Siri voice shortcuts you can control many aspects of your Nest, such as instant activation of heating or cooling, setting the temperature by saying how many degrees you want to set, increasing/decreasing the temperature, and setting the Home/Away state. Thanks to Thermo Watch, It's all finally just one casual \"Hey Siri\" away, all with informative visual and verbal feedback.\n• From the watch face, tap on the Thermo Watch complication to open the app. Spin the Digital Crown, or Swipe up/down to adjust the temperature. You can start adjusting the moment the app opens.\n• On your iOS device you can see the thermostat info on the home screen widget, you can swipe to the widget panel to adjust the temperature on the interactive widget, or you can just open the app. Again, you can start adjusting the moment the controls appear.\n• From your Apple TV, open the app, and swipe up/down on the remote to change the temperate.\n\nThe app is fully functional with an initial purchase. The in-app purchases are used only for giving a tip to the developer.\n\nThe app will let you know with a chime and a tap, that the thermostat has received and applied your command.\n\nMonitor your Thermostats and Home/Away status right from the watch face, using complications that update in the background, without having to launch the app.\n\nYou can use Siri on your iPhone, Watch, iPad, or HomePod to control any of your thermostats. Record phrases that make most sense to you, such as \"Start Heating\" or \"Make it Cooler\". If you have multiple thermostats you can control them individually, by saying for example \"Start Heating Upstairs\" or \"Start Cooling the Living Room\".\n\nVisit https://thermowatch.net/siri website for the detailed instructions of Siri operation.\n\nSet Geofence around your home to reliably set the Home and Away state when you come and go.\n\nThe app supports multiple thermostats in multiple homes - just swipe left and right on your Watch screen to access them, or see them all at the same time in the iOS Widget and the app. Fahrenheit and Celsius are both supported.\n\nBeyond that, you can press the Watch screen firmly for additional functions, like switching to a heating or cooling mode, setting the away status, choosing the active temperature sensor, or turning the fan on and off.\n\nWhile the app's minimalist looks betray the simplicity of its operation, what they don't show is the amount of planning, design, development and refinement that went into it, ensuring it becomes something that is enjoyable to use and experience.\n\nThermo Watch does not collect any of your data. Your login information, thermostat settings, and any activity - all of it flows exclusively between your devices and Nest. Author of Thermo Watch does not receive any of it, at any point.\nThis app and its developer are unaffiliated with Google Inc. or Google Nest. Nest is a trademark of Google Inc."

On Mac, Fliqlo has long been popular as a screensaver module with the same design since its first release in 2002, and this iOS/iPadOS app is also made with exactly the same design. With its large, highly visible font, you can check the time even from a distance. Also, in everyday life and at work, its modest matt black presence does not distract you or disrupt your productivity, even when using the app for extended periods of time. Its full-screen appearance integrates with the iPhone/iPad device body and blends into your living space ambience, as if it were a minimalist home decor item.\n\nFEATURES:\n- Switch between 12/24 hour clock\n- Switch between portrait and landscape mode\n- Option to show seconds when tapping screen\n- Brightness/dimness control inside the app\n- Show/hide background tiles\n- Enlarge/reduce to any size\n\nNOTES:\n- Your device’s Auto-Lock is disabled while this clock is active in the foreground.\n- This app does not start automatically like the Mac screensaver.\n- You cannot replace your device’s Lock Screen with this clock."

      "label": "Ravit is a fun app that enables you to discover inspirational patterns and yarns, update your projects and stash and browse and post to Ravelry forums from anywhere. It's super quick, and it's friendly. Ravelry on mobile has never been easier.\n\nFIND INSPIRATIONAL PATTERNS\nIf you’re not sure what you’d like to make next, Ravit lets you easily browse patterns, favorite them, download and view pattern PDFs, view project photos and browse a designer’s other patterns and pattern suggestions. \n\nAnd if you want to narrow your search, choose from dozens of filters including craft, availability, category, attributes, needles, weight and more. You can even combine multiple options with AND, NOT or OR. It's powerful, but easy.\n\nThere's so many beautiful patterns on Ravelry, and Ravit helps you find them easily.\n\nTAKE RAVELRY TO YOUR YARN STORE\nFind out which yarns you’ll need for a project. Check what yardage you need. Look in your stash to see if you’ve already got a yarn, or one that’s similar. And because Ravit is designed to work nicely on your iPhone or iPad with readable text and buttons you can tap, you won't be squinting as you find all the info you need when you're at your LYS.\n\n+ Search all yarns by keyword, filter by fiber, weight, attributes and many others, and sort by options including 'Most projects' and 'Highest rating'. Quickly view pattern suggestions and projects for a yarn.\n\n+ Access your stash offline. No wireless or cell signal in your yarn store? No problem! Your stash is cached on your device so you can search, sort and view your stash offline.\n\nSNAP, EDIT AND UPLOAD ON THE SPOT\nPerhaps you're making a project on the train to work, or relaxed on the couch at home - whenever you are inspired to share your WIPs, Ravit makes it easy to snap photos, enhance with powerful photo filters, and upload to Ravelry, all from the one app.\n\n+ Powerful Photo Editing Tools - enhance, crop, and adjust your photos before your upload and show your work in it's best possible light. You can remove blemishes, improve color balance, sharpen images and access many other pro editing tools all from within the app.\n\n+ Optimized for Ravelry - before images are uploaded, they're resized optimally for Ravelry, so you'll upload smaller photos (up to 10x smaller!) more quickly and using less data.\n\n+ More than just photos - you can update notes for your Projects, Queued Projects and Stash, as well as most of the other info such as yarns, yardage, skeins, colorways, and color for your stash, and progress, link to stash, rating, craft, and tags amongst others for your projects.\n\nIT'S ALL THE LITTLE THINGS...\nSo why use Ravit? It's all the the little, sometimes hidden touches which make Ravit shine. Here's a few of them.\n\n+ It's quick - if you tap on something, you go right there. \n\n+ Infinite scroll - smooth, continuous scrolling as you browse to find inspiration.\n\n+ Offline - whether you're commuting underground, or you're off-grid, Ravit lets you access your Projects and Stash offline.\n\n+ Clean, uncluttered interface - we want your work and the beauty of Ravelry.com to shine. \n\n+ Use up to 50%* less data in Ravit compared with your web browser. \n\n+ Squint less - The text in Ravit isn't made super small, and we're fully Dynamic Type compatible, so if you change the font size on your device, it'll change in Ravit.\n\n* Based on tests of browsing patterns, projects, stash and yarns on Ravit and Safari on the same device - YYMV! (Your Yardage May Vary)\n\nTHIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING\nRavit has many features already, but we are constantly enhancing and adding more features. We have an active group on Ravelry and we'd love to hear what you'd like to see next - join in the discussion at http://www.ravelry.com/groups/ravit\n\nRavit is not affiliated with ravelry.com. It is an independent app, developed by a husband and wife team. You can read more about why we made Ravit at http://www.enhancient.com/ravit\n\nDownload Ravit now and hop on to Ravelry."

      "label": "The Secret to Money is an app that is designed to change the way you think about money, and to radically change the circumstances of money in your life.\n\nInspired by Rhonda Byrne's worldwide best selling phenomenon, The Secret, in this app you will develop a whole new perspective on your own personal finances and potential to live a life of abundance.\n\nThe Secret to Money is a personal development program of games and daily activities created by Rhonda Byrne herself, featuring 6 powerful Secret-inspired practices that will help you develop a wealth mindset:\n\nDESIRES\nPURCHASES\nMANIFESTED MONEY\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS\nAFFIRMATIONS\nGIVING\n\nDESIRES: In this practice, you create a list of 7 things you would buy if money were no object. This \"Secret\" list reminds you of why you want more money in your life, and what it would actually feel like to have the things you desire most.\n\nPURCHASES: In this practice, you will change your mindset about money by spending large amounts of money in your imagination. Every day, you will receive virtual checks in escalating amounts from the Bank of the Universe, as first introduced in The Secret book. Using your imagination, you “spend” each check on whatever you want or need, and record these purchases within the app. Currencies are localised for each country and set according to the language and location setting on the phone or tablet.\n\nMANIFESTED MONEY: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have manifested money today - money you have received, saved, were gifted or refunded. You will be surprised by how much \"Secret\" money you begin to manifest every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS: When it comes to money, a little bit of inspiration goes a long way towards increasing the money in your life. In this daily practice, you will receive inspiring, financially themed messages drawn from The Secret books in order to help you change the way you think about money. Each inspiration is available to share.\n\nAFFIRMATIONS: Affirmations are positive statements that you make to create a positive mindset and change your life on a particular subject. In this daily practice, you will read 25 unique affirmations of wealth and abundance inspired by The Secret to help change your money mindset.\n\nGIVING: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have given to others - charitable donations, tips, gifts and giveaways, covering the check at dinner, or buying coffee for a friend.  You will be surprised by how much you give to others every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nThe Secret to Money was designed specifically for you as your invitation to use The Secret in order to live the life of your dreams. As Rhonda says herself:\n\n\"Like many people, I was brought up with the belief that money is hard to come by, and that you have to work really hard for money. I even had the belief that I would never have much money because my family didn’t have money.\n\n\"All these beliefs came from just one belief – a belief in a lack of money.\n\n\"So, in 2004, while researching for The Secret film, I created many different money practices and invented lots of imaginary money games in order to change my belief in a lack of money to a belief in an abundance of money. I committed to these practices, and did them every day. And today, there is no lack in my life whatsoever.\n\n\"The Secret team has taken my life-changing money practices that took me from lack to abundance and put them into The Secret to Money App. The App is simple, practical, and designed to radically change the circumstances of money in your life, as it did for me.\"\n\nAvailable in English, Spanish, German, French, Japanese, Korean, Hindi and Mandarin."

From Polynesian (Tahitian, Samoan, Tongan, etc.) tatau. In Marquesan, tatu.\" Before the importation of the Polynesian word, the practice of tattooing had been described in the West as pricking, painting, or staining. Sailors on the voyage later introduced both the word and reintroduced the concept of tattooing to Europe.\n\nThis is not to be confused with the origins of the word for the military drumbeat — see military tattoo. In this case, the English word tattoo is derived from the Dutch word taptoe (OED).\n\nThe first written reference to the word tattoo (or tatau), appears in the journal of Joseph Banks (24 February 1743 – 19 June 1820), the naturalist aboard Captain Cook's ship the HMS Endeavour: \"I shall now mention the way they mark themselves indelibly, each of them is so marked by their humor or disposition\".\n\nThe word \"tattoo\" was brought to Europe by the explorer James Cook, when he returned in 1771 from his first voyage to Tahiti and New Zealand. In his narrative of the voyage, he refers to an operation called \"tattaw\". Before this it had been described as scarring, painting, or staining\n\nTattoo enthusiasts may refer to tattoos as \"ink\", \"pieces\", \"skin art\", \"tattoo art\", \"tats\", or \"work\"; to the creators as \"tattoo artists\", \"tattooers\", or \"tattooists\"; and to places where they work as \"tattoo shops\", \"tattoo studios\", or \"tattoo parlors\".\n\n\nA tattooed man's back, Japan, c. 1875\nUsage of the terms \"skin art\", \"tattoo art\", \"pieces\", and work\" is gaining greater support,[citation needed] with mainstream art galleries holding exhibitions of both conventional and custom tattoo designs. Beyond Skin, at the Museum of Croydon, is an example of this as it challenges the stereotypical view of tattoos and who has them. Copyrighted tattoo designs that are mass-produced and sent to tattoo artists are known as \"flash\", a notable instance of industrial design. Flash sheets are prominently displayed in many tattoo parlors for the purpose of providing both inspiration and ready-made tattoo images to customers.\n\nThe Japanese word irezumi means \"insertion of ink\" and can mean tattoos using tebori, the traditional Japanese hand method, a Western-style machine, or for that matter, any method of tattooing using insertion of ink. The most common word used for traditional Japanese tattoo designs is Horimono. Japanese may use the word \"tattoo\" to mean non-Japanese styles of tattooing."

What a sight!\n\nThe app has Siri Voice shortcuts, and they can be used to set your home into Away or Home state using Siri on your Watch or iPhone, as well as to display the live feeds from your cameras.\n\nThe app supports Apple Watch LTE, and can work when the iPhone is not around - as long as the watch itself has internet access (either LTE or WiFi).\n\nThe app is fully functional with an initial purchase. The in-app purchases are used only for giving a tip to the developer.\n\nWatch Cam lets you monitor all your Nest Cams from the Apple Watch or the iOS Widget.\n• From the watch face, tap on the Watch Cam complication to open the app. Swipe left and right to view life feeds from all your Nest Cams.\n• One of the watch complications shows you the snapshot from the camera of your choice, right on the watch face. The snapshot updates periodically all on its own, so you'll have a recent view of your camera any time you look at the watch. Useful when waiting for that package to arrive.\n• On your iOS device you can swipe to the widget panel to see what's on all of your cameras.\n• View the continuously updated Live Feed from the camera in the watch app, the iOS widget, or the iOS app. The feed updates with a new image approximately every second on the iOS and two seconds on the Watch - may be faster or slower, depending on your network speed.\n• Use the digital crown on the Watch to zoom in and out, or tap the screen to toggle zoom levels.\n• Use the pinch gesture on the camera views in the iOS app to zoom in and out. Single tap toggles the zoom level in the iOS app and the iOS widget.\n• Turn the device to landscape mode to increase the camera views sizes.\n• Double tap on the Live Feed view in the iOS app or the widget to launch the Nest app.\n• Set Geofence around your home to reliably set the Home and Away state when you come and go.\n\nWatch Face Complications can display the following:\n• Snapshot from the camera of your choice that updates periodically.\n• Status of all the cameras - if the camera icon is green, it means that all your cameras are online and streaming. If it's dimmed, it means that some cameras are off.\n\nYou can long-press the Watch screen for additional functions, like setting the home/away status, or turning the camera streaming on and off.\n\nWhile the app's minimalist looks betray the simplicity of its operation, what they don't show is the amount of planning, design, development and refinement that went into it, ensuring it becomes something that is enjoyable to use and experience.\n\nPlease Note: Watch Cam does not collect any of your data. Your login information, camera feeds, and any activity - all of it flows exclusively between your devices and Nest. Author of Watch Cam does not receive any of it, at any point.\nThis app and its developer are unaffiliated with Google Inc. or Google Nest. Nest is a trademark of Google Inc."

      "label": "Words---words of new perspectives, words of an enlightening perspective, words that were once known but somehow forgotten---that's what these Well-being cards are about.\nWords don't teach; life experience teaches. But with these Abraham-Hicks words fresh in your mind, your every life experience will now be more meaningful to you. And since nothing is more imporant than feeling good, nothing is more valuable than these processes that will allow more of your natural Well-being to flow.\nHave fun with these cards. Let these words inspire thoughts that will attract to you more of that which evokes your greatest joy.\"\n\nFEATURES:\n- Browse The Teachings of Abraham Well-Being Cards anywhere, anytime on your iOS device*\n- Save cards to review at any time*\n- Email cards to yourself or share with a friend*\n\nAbout the Author:\nExcited about the clarity and practicality of the translated word from the Beings who call themselves Abraham, Esther and Jerry Hicks began disclosing their amazing Abraham experience to a handful of close business associates in 1986.\nRecognizing the practical results being received by themselves and by those people who were asking practical questions and then applying Abraham’s answers to their own situations, Esther and Jerry made a deliberate decision to allow the teachings of Abraham to become available to an ever-widening circle of seekers of how to live a happier life.\n\nUsing their San Antonio, Texas, conference center as their base, Jerry and Esther have traveled to approximately 50 cities a year since 1989, presenting interactive Law of Attraction workshops to those leaders who gather to participate in this expanding stream of progressive thought. And although worldwide attention has been given to this philosophy of Well-Being by Leading Edge thinkers and teachers who have, in turn, incorporated many of Abraham’s Law of Attraction concepts into their best-selling books, scripts, lectures, and so forth, the primary spread of this material has been from person to person—as individuals begin to discover the value of this form of spiritual practicality in their personal life experiences.\n\nIn November 2011, Jerry made his transition into Non-Physical, and now Esther continues to conduct the Abraham workshops with the help of her physical friends and co-workers and, of course, with the Non-Physical help of Abraham and Jerry.\nPeople are able to access Abraham directly by attending the seminars in person or by participating in the online live streaming of most events. There is also an extensive YouTube library of Abraham videos.\nAbraham—a group of uplifting Non-Physical teachers—present their Broader Perspective through Esther Hicks. And as they speak to our level of comprehension through a series of loving, allowing, brilliant, yet comprehensively simple essays in print and in sound, they guide us to a clear connection with our loving Inner Being, and to uplifting self-empowerment from our Total Self.\n\nOfficial Hay House licensed App: www.HayHouse.com®"

      "label": "QuiltPaper creates graph paper for quilters. More than just a 1/4” grid — a tap does much of the ‘drafting' needed for quilt design by adding borders, sashing, cornerstones, diagonals for triangles, and more.\n\nStandard graph paper grids are included. For example, design an on-point quilt by starting with included Diagonal Paper. Make your own expensive, hard-to-find specialty papers and EPP templates: hexagon, diamond, triangle, HST & HRT templates, tumbler, polygon, eight and six point star, honeycomb (Lucy Boston), jewel, kite, brick, log cabin, square, circle, arc, and pinwheel by adding InApp purchases.\n\nQuiltPaper also makes it easy to work with inspiration images because you can place an image ‘just so’ under a grid by adjusting the image to fit!\n\nOnce a setting is complete, the design can be brought into the Paint Tool (with the inspiration image!) for coloring with solids and textures. While there is an extensive color palette available, unlimited custom color palettes can be created by — \n• Taking colors from images or live camera\n• Setting RGB or HSB codes\n• Selecting colors on the color wheel\n\nNOTE — If you are looking for a quilt block library, you will not find one here. QuiltPaper app is for quilters who use a grid to plan and design a quilt. It is worth mentioning, however, that a few in-app purchase papers use a Pattern Planner tool that offers at least a minimum level of block planning. These papers are Pinwheel, Arc, and Log Cabin.\n\nEnjoy English Paper Piecing? \nMake your own EPP templates. QuiltPaper can create shapes at the exact size you need for your project. You can even place a circle at the center of each template to cut a hole for easier paper removal. Once the template page is set, it can be — \n•Printed to cut templates by hand\n•Exported as a PDF or SVG to laser and pattern cutting machines\n\nHST & HRT paper (InApp purchase) lets you make your own at the exact size you want — \n• HST. Set overall size and seam allowance for template.\n• HRT. Set overall size and seam allowance for template with trimmed corners for easier, accurate matching during assembly (no ‘dog ears’).\n\nPURCHASE INCLUDES 3 PAPERS:\nGRID — Classic grid graph paper taken up a notch! \nDOT— Choice of 5 dot styles and 2 dot patterns.\nDIAGONAL — On-point design graph paper.\n\n— FEATURES OF ALL PAPERS —\n√  Buy once — purchase works on all devices — iPhone, iPad, iPod.\n√  Metric (cm or mm) and Inch settings for grid and page size. \n√  Paint quilt layout with color and pattern. Make your own color palettes.\n√  Place an inspiration image under any grid, then adjust size and placement.\n√  Up to four line colors on a grid.\n√  Put multiple grids on a page to plan block designs, assembly, etc.\n√  Title grid with choice of font, size, bold or italic, and color.\n√  Print on standard sized page (such as 8.5x11 or A4) or set a custom size.\n√  Avoid the headache of scaling a design by setting the page at the quilt actual size by using ‘Custom’ page size setting.\n√  Library of Quick Pick templates offer inspiration  and a short cut to creating layouts.\n√  Print or share grids as a PDF, PNG or SVG to other apps for further editing — even as templates to laser or pattern cutting machines.\n√  Share painted grids as a PNG or PDF. \n√  Work up close using pinch-n-zoom gesture.\n√  Place a center-point on most papers. \n\nIN-APP PURCHASES unlock specialty papers: \nTriangle\nHST & HRT\nTumbler\nDiamond\nPolygon (especially helpful to make shapes for EPP)\nHexagon\nHoneycomb (Lucy Boston)\n8 point star (Lone Star)\n6 point star\nLog Cabin\nJewel\nJewel Ring\nKite\nBrick\nSquare\nCircle\nArc\nPinwheel\n\n• ‘All Papers Forever’ bundle.

Nothing is stored in \"the cloud\" where it could be hacked. \n\nThe Vault 4th Step Inventory App allows you to enter your inventory information in a logical step by step way, then saves the information in an inventory spreadsheet that is laid out much like many of the 4th Step guides that you can find on the internet (like Joe and Charlie’s).  The difference is that the Vault app lets you work on your 4th step anywhere, anytime that you are free and in a safe place, NOT just when you are free at your home with your notebook.  It is Vault Code protected at all times, so whether it is on your nightstand or at the coffee shop, NO ONE can access your inventory but you. \n\nWe decided (through much discussion) to minimize all instructions on HOW to do a 4th Step. As alcoholics, we had no shortage of opinions on what each of us believed were the best instructions. We decided to use the original text from the Big Book for the actual questions for you to answer, instead of rewording them as we saw some of the 4th Step \"guides\" do. \n\nYour sponsor may want you to write out (with pen and paper) your 4th step. If that is the case, you may still utilize the app to collect your inventory information, then after printing it out, copy it over by hand.  \n\nThis app is not AA reviewed or approved. AA does not endorse or approve anything or anyone. All quotes are from the 1st edition of the Big Book.  This app was created by members for members. Thanks to their generous support this app is FREE to anyone world-wide. Remember: Our primary purpose is to stay sober, and help another alcoholic.\n\nThanks,\n\nTwelve Step Apps\nwww.12StepApps.org"

      "label": "After many years of researching sensor data for lots of different types of paranormal apps, I have concluded that the best way for Spirits to manipulate a device (or the device sensors) is by keeping it simple and universal across the whole world.\n\nThe Spirit Music Box works similar to the world famous Para4ce device, but this uses a lot more sensors and is more complex!\n\nIf any of the sensors pick up a change then the Music Box will start playing an old eerie music box song.\n\nSimply place the device in any area, click the \"Calibrate\" button then move away from the device. If you move the device after it has been calibrated you will need to recalibrate, simply click the \"Back\" button, move the device to a new area, then click \"Calibrate\" again.\n\nThere are 12 music box songs that his app randomly chooses from when it calibrates.\n\nThe sensors used are:\n\nMagnetometer - This senses Magnetic and Electromagnet fields around the device\nAccelerometer - This senses any device movement and the slightest vibrations around the device\nBarometer - Detects any change in the Ambient Air Pressure around the device\nCompass - Detects the slightest change in magnetic interference to Magnetic North\nGyroScope - Detects the slightest movement of the device\nOrientation - Detects the slightest movement to the position of the device\n\nIf your device is missing any sensors, the app will still work perfectly well without them.\n\n\n** Disclaimer **\n\nUse at your own risk, I cannot be held personally responsible for you or any outcome (paranormal or otherwise) from using this app!"

When its wisdom is sought with sincerity and sensitivity, this ancient Chinese oracle will promote success and good fortune and impart balance and perspective to your life. Its lasting popularity lies in the profound lessons it teaches about how reliance on one's higher qualities leads to life's greatest rewards: well-being, understanding, and peace of mind.  \n\nNow available as an elegantly designed and easy to use iOS app, it is both highly accessible to new users and a revelation to those long familiar with the text. Throw your own coins, or let the app cast for you, and make the wisdom of the sages your own. Includes a journal for recording your questions, results, and thoughts.\n\nBrian Browne Walker is the author of celebrated contemporary translations of the I Ching, Tao te Ching, Hua hu Ching, Wei wu Wei Ching, and Art of War which are published by Harper and St. Martin's Press and translated into over a dozen languages around the world. His \"I Ching, or Book of Changes\", long beloved for its clarity and accessibility, has received five star reviews on Amazon consistently for over a decade."

      "label": "Want to display or send SSTV transmissions, without using a bulky computer? SSTV Pad lets you decode and display Ham (Amateur) Radio SSTV (Slow Scan TV) transmissions. Just connect your device to an HF radio (or even set it next to the radio's speaker), tune in an SSTV frequency, and watch the pictures. SSTV Pad decodes all of the popular SSTV modes, including Robot, Scottie, Martin, and more. Some modes are receive only. \n\nDecoding of SSTV transmissions begins automatically as soon as the start of image audio signals are detected, and the image format is automatically selected. Manual control is also available for use when receiving conditions are poor. Timing signals (phase and skew) can be adjusted to compensate for mismatches with the sending station. \n\nReceived images can be saved - including automatically as they are received. You can leave the app running unattended, and come back to view all the received images. You can review saved images, as well as send them via email, and use iTunes file sharing to transfer them to your computer. You can even share them on your Facebook page, or tweet them to your followers, directly from the app! (iOS 6 and later)\n\nYou can also transmit images, taken from your saved photos or taken with your device's camera. Text, such as your callsign, can be added to the sent image.\n\nBuy your copy right now, and start decoding and displaying SSTV transmissions in minutes. Just set your iPhone or iPad next to the radio speaker, and watch the pictures come rolling in.\n\nNote: If you cannot see the transmit button, go to the Accessibility settings for your device and turn Button Shapes OFF. It makes the buttons too large so you cannot see them all. \n\nAlso, It is very important to have a well tuned signal of good quality, and make sure you get the audio from your radio to your device without adding additional distortion, or auto start and mode detect will not work optimally. Please see this page for tips on using the app and connecting your radio: http://www.blackcatsystems.com/ipad/iPad_SSTV_Pad_FAQ.html\n\nYou can also use Bluetooth audio devices to feed audio into your device. Please be sure to use a good quality Bluetooth device, that does not distort the audio.\n\nModes supported for reception (not all modes can be transmitted):\nB&W 8 sec\nB&W 12 sec\nB&W 24 sec\nB&W 36 sec \nMartin M1\nMartin M1\nMartin M2\nMartin M3\nMartin M4\nMP73\" \nMP115 \nMP140 \nMP175\nMR73 \nMR90\nMR115 \nMR140 \nMR175 \nPD 50\nPD 90 \nPD 120 \nPD 160\nPD 180\nPD 240\nPD 290 \nRobot 12C\nRobot 24C\nRobot 36C\nRobot 72C\nSC-1 32 sec\nSC-1 16 sec\nSC-1 8 sec\nSC-2-60\nSC-2-120\nSC-2-180\nScottie S1\nScottie S2\nScottie S3\nScottie S4\nScottie DX"

Depending on your location, the application choose the appropriate calculation method and Fiqhi school. \n\nFor an accurate location, please ensure that your location settings and your Internet connection or your GPS are enabled!\n\nNote about App features :\n-------------------------------\nIf you are familiar with Salatuk in other platforms please note that this version DOESN'T SUPPORT some features like \"Turn Phone to Silent after Athan\". Other features like \"Full Athan\" and \"Custom Athan\" are supported only when the app is ope. This is because of technical limitations. We will try to fix it once iOS system allows it.\n\nNote about Athan :\n-----------------\nSalatuk remind you that it's time for prayer with a \"4 takbeerats\" instead of full Athan. Because of technical limitations, it's possible to play full Athan only if the app is open. \n\nAlso, if you have problems to hear the notifications, please make sure to enable the following parameters in your device :\n\n1) Settings>Sounds>Alerts \n2) Settings>Notifications>Salatuk \n3) Your phone is not on mute and volume is correct\n\nNote about Prayers times :\n-----------------------------------\nPlease note that we pay attention to ensure that the prayer times of Salatuk are accurate. However, in some countries those times may be not exact. In this case, please refer to the official islamic institutions or mosques in your country and adjust manually the prayer times in the application settings.\n\nSalatuk supports currently 3 languages : Arabic, English and French.\n\nTips for a better usage\n-----------------------------\n\n1- In order to refresh the prayer alarms, make sure to open the application once a week. Please do so also when you change your location or timing (summer time).\n\n2- The prayer alarms corresponds to 2 or 4 Takbeerats. If you want to hear the complete Athan you should open the app at the moment of the Athan.\n\n**********************************************************************************\n\nتطبيق صلاتك رفيقك للحفاظ على صلاتك.\nعن طريق تحديد موقعك  تلقائيا، بإمكان هذا التطبيق أن يعلمك بأوقات الصلاة وكذلك تحديد اتجاه القبلة. تطبيق صلاتك يستعمل عددا مهما من الطرق الحسابية  المعتمدة في أغلب العالم الإسلامي. اعتمادا على موقعك، يختار التطبيق طريقة الحساب والمدرسة الفقهية المناسبة. \n\nحول خصائص التطبيق \n---------------------\nإذا كنت ممن يستعمل صلاتك على أنظمة أخرى، المرجو الانتباه إلى أن هذه النسخة لا تحتوي على بعض الخصائص مثل \"التحويل إلى الصامت\" كما أن بعض الخصائص الأخرى مثل \"الأذان الكامل\" و\"إضافة أذان من الذاكرة\" لا تشتغل إلا إذا كان التطبيق مفتوحا. يرجع ذلك إلى بعض القيود التقنية الموجودة حاليا في نظام أبل وسنحاول دعمها حالما ترفع هذه القيود.\n\n\nحول سماع الأذان \n---------------\nمن ناحية  أخرى إذا كان عندك مشكل في سماع التنبيهات، المرجو التاكد من أن الإعدادات التالية مفعلة في هاتفك : \n1) الإعدادات > الأصوات > تنبيهات التذكير\n2) الإعدادات >التنبيهات > صلاتك   \n3) هاتفك ليس في الوضع الصامت والصوت في مستوى جيد\n\nحول مواقيت الصلاة:\n-----------------\nننوه إلى أنه رغم المجهودات لتدقيق مواقيت الصلاة التي يقوم بها فريق صلاتك، إلا أنه في بعض البلدان قد تكون المواقيت غير مضبوطة بشكل تام، في هذه الحالة نرجو منكم الاعتماد على المواقيت الرسمية في بلدكم أو المسجد القريب منكم، مع العلم أنه يمكنكم تعديل الأوقات يدويا في نافذة الإعدادات.\n\nنصائح من أجل استعمال أفضل \n-------------------------\n\n1- حتى يتم تحديث إشعارات الأذان إحرص على فتح التطبيق مرة كل أسبوع على الأقل أو عندما تغير مكانك أو يتغير التوقيت في بلدك (التوقيت الصيفي)\n\n2- تطبيق صلاتك يشعرك بدخول وقت الصلاة على شكل تكبيرتين أو 4 تكبيرات. إذا أردت أن تستمع إلى الأذان كاملا المرجو أن تفتح التطبيق أثناء الأذان."

You will experience an enhancing of your personal power, which may, at first, seem illogical or even magical, as the Energy Stream from which these cards have come dovetails with the true essence of your own being.\n\nAs you return for frequent visits to these beautiful cards, you will begin to notice a definite closing of the gap between where you are and where you want to be on all subjects that are important to you.\nFEATURES:\n- Browse Ask And It Is Given cards anywhere, anytime on your iOS device*\n- Save cards to review at any time*\n- Email cards to yourself or share with a friend*\n\nAbout the Author:\nExcited about the clarity and practicality of the translated word from the Beings who call themselves Abraham, Esther and Jerry Hicks began disclosing their amazing Abraham experience to a handful of close business associates in 1986.\nRecognizing the practical results being received by themselves and by those people who were asking practical questions and then applying Abraham’s answers to their own situations, Esther and Jerry made a deliberate decision to allow the teachings of Abraham to become available to an ever-widening circle of seekers of how to live a happier life.\n\nUsing their San Antonio, Texas, conference center as their base, Jerry and Esther have traveled to approximately 50 cities a year since 1989, presenting interactive Law of Attraction workshops to those leaders who gather to participate in this expanding stream of progressive thought. And although worldwide attention has been given to this philosophy of Well-Being by Leading Edge thinkers and teachers who have, in turn, incorporated many of Abraham’s Law of Attraction concepts into their best-selling books, scripts, lectures, and so forth, the primary spread of this material has been from person to person—as individuals begin to discover the value of this form of spiritual practicality in their personal life experiences.\n\nIn November 2011, Jerry made his transition into Non-Physical, and now Esther continues to conduct the Abraham workshops with the help of her physical friends and co-workers and, of course, with the Non-Physical help of Abraham and Jerry.\nPeople are able to access Abraham directly by attending the seminars in person or by participating in the online live streaming of most events. There is also an extensive YouTube library of Abraham videos.\nAbraham—a group of uplifting Non-Physical teachers—present their Broader Perspective through Esther Hicks. And as they speak to our level of comprehension through a series of loving, allowing, brilliant, yet comprehensively simple essays in print and in sound, they guide us to a clear connection with our loving Inner Being, and to uplifting self-empowerment from our Total Self."

      "label": "\"A beautiful new set of cards that helps access the deep knowledge only available through the Vortex. As Esther herself explains:\n\n'Dear Friends, It is always satisfying for me to be able to tap into the Vibration of Abraham and to translate their empowering message into our current time and space. I really believe that this deck of cards not only contains everything necessary to attract and maintain wonderful relationships, but it also explains everything that we would ever need to understand about living our lives here in these bodies at this time. Every time I reflect upon the depth of understanding that is reflected in these cards, I am restored to my true nature. This deck of cards is my most precious possession. With love, Esther.'  \n\nFEATURES:\n- Browse Getting into the cards anywhere, anytime on your device\n- Save cards to review at any time\n- Email cards to yourself or share with a friend\n\nAbout the Author:\nExcited about the clarity and practicality of the translated word from the Beings who call themselves Abraham, Esther and Jerry Hicks began disclosing their amazing Abraham experience to a handful of close business associates in 1986.\nRecognizing the practical results being received by themselves and by those people who were asking practical questions and then applying Abraham’s answers to their own situations, Esther and Jerry made a deliberate decision to allow the teachings of Abraham to become available to an ever-widening circle of seekers of how to live a happier life.\n\nUsing their San Antonio, Texas, conference center as their base, Jerry and Esther have traveled to approximately 50 cities a year since 1989, presenting interactive Law of Attraction workshops to those leaders who gather to participate in this expanding stream of progressive thought. And although worldwide attention has been given to this philosophy of Well-Being by Leading Edge thinkers and teachers who have, in turn, incorporated many of Abraham’s Law of Attraction concepts into their best-selling books, scripts, lectures, and so forth, the primary spread of this material has been from person to person—as individuals begin to discover the value of this form of spiritual practicality in their personal life experiences.\n\nIn November 2011, Jerry made his transition into Non-Physical, and now Esther continues to conduct the Abraham workshops with the help of her physical friends and co-workers and, of course, with the Non-Physical help of Abraham and Jerry.\nPeople are able to access Abraham directly by attending the seminars in person or by participating in the online live streaming of most events. There is also an extensive YouTube library of Abraham videos.\nAbraham—a group of uplifting Non-Physical teachers—present their Broader Perspective through Esther Hicks. And as they speak to our level of comprehension through a series of loving, allowing, brilliant, yet comprehensively simple essays in print and in sound, they guide us to a clear connection with our loving Inner Being, and to uplifting self-empowerment from our Total Self.\n\nOfficial Hay House licensed iOS App: www.HayHouse.com®\""

      "label": "Susan Miller’s Moonlight App features:\n\n• Know the times Moon is Void of Course at your current location and as you travel. \n\n• Explains the 8 phases of the moon (new moon, quarter moon, full moon, balsamic moon and, so forth), what each phase means, and how to take advantage of each phase by timing your actions accordingly.\n\n• It takes the moon 2.5 days to travel through one sign, so the app’s simple calendar reveals which zodiac sign the moon is traveling in for each day and the exact time it changes signs. Some signs that the moon travels through are especially favorable for certain actions—find out the details.\n\n• This app has no subscription—it is a one-time purchase. You get all the daily information you need through 2050.\n\nYou have heard the buzz on social media about “moon void of course” or a “void moon” (both have the same meaning). You may be curious about whether you should pay attention to when the moon is void of course. By knowing when a void moon is upcoming, you can schedule actions to avoid those periods to create the most successful outcome possible. It is an app you will use quite a bit—you will want to check it every morning. \n\nSome days the moon never goes void, other days the moon will go void for a few minutes, and still other days the moon will be void for several hours—possibly for the entire day or, in rare cases, for several days. Every day is unique, so the void is never repeated in the same way, the reason you need Susan’s Moonlight app. \n\nIf you schedule a meeting when the moon is void, it will either be cancelled, or the meeting will come to nothing. Things will go on as they have before with no change. You should not schedule a first date or a wedding during a moon void period, nor should you sign a contract, have a job interview, or meet with the press during a void moon, as examples. It would not be a good idea to buy an airline ticket during a void moon, for you may have to exchange it later. If your action is vital, avoid the void. \n\nThis is an aspect that affects everyone uniformly, similar to Mercury retrograde.\n\nWith Susan Miller’s new appealing app, Moonlight, void of course periods are easy to find, understand, and navigate. The information is written in Susan Miller’s signature warm, optimistic style, and she uses no astro-babble language to confuse you. Until now, knowing when the moon is void required looking up the moon’s void of course periods on tables that are listed by Greenwich Mean Time and converting to your location. With Moonlight, the answer is a snap on Susan Miller’s app.\n\nWhat is the moon void of course, and when does it happen?\n\nThe void of course period of the moon begins when the moon has finished meeting with the other planets and has made her last EXACT major aspect to a planet or the Sun. Just as importantly, the moon must still be moving within the same zodiac sign as she was when she started receiving the planets. Once she has met with them all and is finished, the moon will go void of course. \n\nTo be precise, the moon may make an aspect to another planet. It could be a conjunction, square, trine, sextile, or opposition. These are the aspects that were outlined by the ancient Egyptian astrologer Ptolemy. Ptolemy is considered the father of the Western astrology we use today, and we call these aforementioned aspects “Ptolemaic” aspects. You need not be concerned about knowing what these aspects mean—Susan Miller does the work for you.\n\nAfter the moon has communicated with other planets each month, the moon rests, and as said, that ushers in the void period. As she rests, the moon cannot lend any of her considerable powers to you. That’s not good for any of us. We need all the help we can get from the graceful moon on a daily basis."

It's very easy to use.\n\nFantastic App!  - byHot K - May 6, 2014\nI LOVE this app. I really needed something to help me make heads or tails out of mine & my new puppies day so we could have a smooth, fun house training process.

      "label": "This app teaches you to 'receive' Morse code.\n\nIt starts with two letters and automatically adds more when it understands that you are ready.\n\nThis is the easiest and most efficient way to learn Morse code as the app focuses on the practice you need next, instead of wasting your time with stuff you already know or confusing you with stuff that you still don’t.\n\nThe original idea comes from Ward K9OX (http://c2.com/morse/).\n\nBy default the app uses the 'Koch' method letter sequence and starts with the first two letters: K and M. But you can use any of the methods available and find the one that suits more your likings. There's also a training program for the top 40 words used during a CW QSO.\n\nAround each letter you have a circle chart showing how high is your error score. It starts from 100% (full circle) and lowers as you start guessing letters right and increases when you are wrong or you take too much time to recognise them.\n\nTo start the training, simply press the PLAY button on the top right of the display.\n\nAt this point the app will start playing tones. Press the one that you think corresponds to the tone. If you are wrong, the app will let you know by playing an 'error' sound. If you are right, the app will continue by picking up another letter or word. Once you'll become good enough with the active letters, the app will enable a new one following the method selected.\n\nYou can decide to put the training lesson on hold by pressing the PAUSE button. Or stop it by pressing the STOP button. If you want to have an automatic stop after a certain amount of minutes, you can set the SESSION TIME in the settings.\n\nWhile not training, you can tap on any key or word and listen to its tone to start to get used to it even outside of the training session.\n\nYou can access the SETTINGS by tapping the 'hamburger icon' on the top left.\n\nYou can look at your top 10 scores by tapping BEST SCORES in the left menu.\n\nImportant: you can use the app in both landscape and portrait mode!\n\nEnjoy learning Morse code!"

      "label": "Simply the best. Whether you're new to the I Ching or have used the book as an oracle, an aid to creativity, or a mirror of your subconscious, you'll love the clarity of writing, the intuition in the design, and the simplicity of use of this digital I Ching or Yi Jing. The modern, no-nonsense interface delivers new users straight to the basics: you ask a question, the I-Ching answers. For old souls who know the book well this app holds a wealth of features for deeper research. There's a journal where you can save and search your questions and readings, a notes area where you can record any length of text as context, a lookup library organized by number and trigram.  You can recreate any I Ching reading using decimal notation.  Original Chinese text included in an alternative selectable library at no additional charge. There are no ads, no subscriptions, no in-app purchases.   \n\nThe I Ching software engine emulates precisely the ancient yarrow stalk method, which was slightly more likely to cast yang than yin. A changing yin line is very rare using stalks,  but of equal probability to changing yang using coins. The ancient divination method uses stalks rather than coins. \n\nIf you prefer to count your own stalks or cast your own coins there's a manual hexagram builder to make your task easier. \n\nThe wisdom and philosophy of the ancient Chinese texts blend seamlessly with commentaries  that gently mix a dash of modern poetry, a pinch of humor, and cultural grace notes from the worlds of art, music, divination, and literature to bring you what many daily users have called the very best I-Ching app available. \n---------\nAmong my favourite reviews: \n\n\"Of all the versions I've used, your renderings of the Book of Changes are my heart-felt favorites. They have inspired me, made me laugh and cry and everything in between.\"\n\n“Pretty profound! This Iching app gave me spot-on advice. I've never paid for an app before, but I had a strong urge to get this one. I'm impressed! Not to sound all new-age but I totally laughed out loud at the reading it gave me, it was like it was sitting here looking over my shoulder and telling me exactly what I needed to know about my grumpy husband. P.S. Grumpy husband called and apologized right when I finished reading my reading.\"\n\n\"Carl Jung would have been happy to have this Yi Jing on his phone - great to use, unfussy, untechy, respectful of the original. The journal feature is great for storing readings and referring back. Well done!\"\n---------\nAll of us sometimes need a sympathetic ear and wise guidance, whether it's in matters of romance or finance: the I-Ching can become a companion along life’s journey like no other. It's a book that helps you explore questions and, if you're lucky, find answers: Whether you believe it's because the book is an oracle or the answers are simply unearthed from your subconscious -- the book's true magic lies in its ability to be a helpful guide (sometimes astoundingly so) to all these different forms of curiosity.   \n\nFollowing the tradition of Baynes and countless interpreters of the original texts, I've written commentaries which borrow words and inspiration from a multitude of sources; Bob Dylan, Lao Tzu, Doctor Who, the Tarot, T.S. Eliot, King Kong, John Lennon, the Grateful Dead and Martin Luther King all make cameo appearances. The language, unlike so many translations, makes every attempt to be gender-neutral.\n\nI wanted the sparest interface possible. No fake parchment backgrounds, no gimmicky images of bamboo or cartoon sages with oracles and winning lottery numbers. I tried not to imitate materials in the real world, but to let this app be its own thing, at home in its digital divination space. \n\nI strived to create a quiet, reflective, slowed down experience in an environment that normally shouts.\n\nI hope you enjoy using this I-Ching app as much as I enjoy crafting it, improving it, and hearing from people who have found it helpful in their lives."

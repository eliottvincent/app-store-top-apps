When a response is detected by the app the words will show visually in the text box along with audible speech.\n\nWhen you have finished your session just click stop. You can also look back at the responses you received during your session by clicking on the folder button (this only works when the scanner is \"Stopped\").\n\nThe EMF Meter only works if your device has a Magnetometer Sensor. If not then the EMF Meter won't be displayed. Please check the compatibility of your phone / tablet.\n\n** Disclaimer **\nUse at your own risk.

You can have a baby monitor with unlimited gear that can be used anywhere without worrying about a weak WiFi signal.\n\nACTIVITY LOG\nBaby Monitor 3G allows you to check, how often was your baby awake, discover its sleeping patterns and replay sounds from current or any previous monitoring.\n\nNIGHT MODE\nThis feature turns the app into a night mode so you can comfortably check your phone placed on the nightstand even during the night without any unnecessary distraction.\n\nEVERY NOISE\nAre you not sure what the little sound you barely hear is? Sensitize the sound for a moment so you can hear every tiny sound from your baby’s room.\n\nTALK TO YOUR BABY\nSimply press a button and speak. Your child will be always one tap away from you.\n\nLULLABIES\nYou can soothe your baby to sleep by playing them some calming music. Lullabies can be imported from the music library or Baby Dreambox app.\n\nNIGHT LIGHT\nSmart night light with adjustable intensity makes it possible to view your baby, even when it’s dark.\n\nPERSONALISATION\nMake Baby Monitor 3G truly yours. You can set it up with the name of your baby, and the app looks differently depending on whether you have a baby boy or baby girl.\n\nSECURE AND RELIABLE\nReliability and privacy are our biggest concerns. You always know the battery level of the baby station, and stability of the internet connection is carefully monitored. In the unlikely event, something goes amiss, you’re notified immediately.\n\nNote about privacy\nWe respect your privacy and that’s why we do not store any data transferred through Baby Monitor 3G or any personal information. The entire connection is encrypted by industry standard SSL. You can find out more details at babymonitor3G.com/privacy\n\nTo see how video works and find more information, go to http://babymonitor3g.com\n\nPlease send us your feedback to support@tappytaps.com. We love to implement new features based on your ideas!"

You can remove blemishes, improve color balance, sharpen images and access many other pro editing tools all from within the app.\n\n+ Optimized for Ravelry - before images are uploaded, they're resized optimally for Ravelry, so you'll upload smaller photos (up to 10x smaller!) more quickly and using less data.\n\n+ More than just photos - you can update notes for your Projects, Queued Projects and Stash, as well as most of the other info such as yarns, yardage, skeins, colorways, and color for your stash, and progress, link to stash, rating, craft, and tags amongst others for your projects.\n\nIT'S ALL THE LITTLE THINGS...\nSo why use Ravit? It's all the the little, sometimes hidden touches which make Ravit shine. Here's a few of them.\n\n+ It's quick - if you tap on something, you go right there. \n\n+ Infinite scroll - smooth, continuous scrolling as you browse to find inspiration.\n\n+ Offline - whether you're commuting underground, or you're off-grid, Ravit lets you access your Projects and Stash offline.\n\n+ Clean, uncluttered interface - we want your work and the beauty of Ravelry.com to shine. \n\n+ Use up to 50%* less data in Ravit compared with your web browser. \n\n+ Squint less - The text in Ravit isn't made super small, and we're fully Dynamic Type compatible, so if you change the font size on your device, it'll change in Ravit.\n\n* Based on tests of browsing patterns, projects, stash and yarns on Ravit and Safari on the same device - YYMV! (Your Yardage May Vary)\n\nTHIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING\nRavit has many features already, but we are constantly enhancing and adding more features.

On Mac, Fliqlo has long been popular as a screensaver module with the same design since its first release in 2002, and this iOS/iPadOS app is also made with exactly the same design. With its large, highly visible font, you can check the time even from a distance. Also, in everyday life and at work, its modest matt black presence does not distract you or disrupt your productivity, even when using the app for extended periods of time. Its full-screen appearance integrates with the iPhone/iPad device body and blends into your living space ambience, as if it were a minimalist home decor item.\n\nFEATURES:\n- Switch between 12/24 hour clock\n- Switch between portrait and landscape mode\n- Option to show seconds when tapping screen\n- Brightness/dimness control inside the app\n- Show/hide background tiles\n- Enlarge/reduce to any size\n\nNOTES:\n- Your device’s Auto-Lock is disabled while this clock is active in the foreground.\n- This app does not start automatically like the Mac screensaver.\n- You cannot replace your device’s Lock Screen with this clock."

      "label": "Apple Watch, Nest Thermostat, and Siri. Together at last.\n\n＊ The app has Siri Voice shortcuts for seamless Siri control of your Nest, from the iPhone, Watch, iPad, and HomePod. It fully supports Apple Watch LTE, and can work when the iPhone is not around - as long as the watch itself has internet access (either LTE or WiFi).\n\n＊ The app lets you monitor and control HomeKit thermostats like Ecobee, and functions largely the same with them as it does with Nest, except for the Siri Shortcuts functionality which is not needed with HomeKit. It lets you see your thermostat info on the Watch complications, and control it using the iOS widget.\n_____________\n\n• Using Siri voice shortcuts you can control many aspects of your Nest, such as instant activation of heating or cooling, setting the temperature by saying how many degrees you want to set, increasing/decreasing the temperature, and setting the Home/Away state. Thanks to Thermo Watch, It's all finally just one casual \"Hey Siri\" away, all with informative visual and verbal feedback.\n• From the watch face, tap on the Thermo Watch complication to open the app. Spin the Digital Crown, or Swipe up/down to adjust the temperature. You can start adjusting the moment the app opens.\n• On your iOS device you can see the thermostat info on the home screen widget, you can swipe to the widget panel to adjust the temperature on the interactive widget, or you can just open the app. Again, you can start adjusting the moment the controls appear.\n• From your Apple TV, open the app, and swipe up/down on the remote to change the temperate.\n\nThe app is fully functional with an initial purchase. The in-app purchases are used only for giving a tip to the developer.\n\nThe app will let you know with a chime and a tap, that the thermostat has received and applied your command.\n\nMonitor your Thermostats and Home/Away status right from the watch face, using complications that update in the background, without having to launch the app.\n\nYou can use Siri on your iPhone, Watch, iPad, or HomePod to control any of your thermostats. Record phrases that make most sense to you, such as \"Start Heating\" or \"Make it Cooler\". If you have multiple thermostats you can control them individually, by saying for example \"Start Heating Upstairs\" or \"Start Cooling the Living Room\".\n\nVisit https://thermowatch.net/siri website for the detailed instructions of Siri operation.\n\nSet Geofence around your home to reliably set the Home and Away state when you come and go.\n\nThe app supports multiple thermostats in multiple homes - just swipe left and right on your Watch screen to access them, or see them all at the same time in the iOS Widget and the app. Fahrenheit and Celsius are both supported.\n\nBeyond that, you can press the Watch screen firmly for additional functions, like switching to a heating or cooling mode, setting the away status, choosing the active temperature sensor, or turning the fan on and off.\n\nWhile the app's minimalist looks betray the simplicity of its operation, what they don't show is the amount of planning, design, development and refinement that went into it, ensuring it becomes something that is enjoyable to use and experience.\n\nThermo Watch does not collect any of your data. Your login information, thermostat settings, and any activity - all of it flows exclusively between your devices and Nest. Author of Thermo Watch does not receive any of it, at any point.\nThis app and its developer are unaffiliated with Google Inc. or Google Nest. Nest is a trademark of Google Inc."

If you move the device after it has been calibrated you will need to recalibrate, simply click the \"Back\" button, move the device to a new area, then click \"Calibrate\" again.\n\nThere are 12 music box songs that his app randomly chooses from when it calibrates.\n\nThe sensors used are:\n\nMagnetometer - This senses Magnetic and Electromagnet fields around the device\nAccelerometer - This senses any device movement and the slightest vibrations around the device\nBarometer - Detects any change in the Ambient Air Pressure around the device\nCompass - Detects the slightest change in magnetic interference to Magnetic North\nGyroScope - Detects the slightest movement of the device\nOrientation - Detects the slightest movement to the position of the device\n\nIf your device is missing any sensors, the app will still work perfectly well without them.\n\n\n** Disclaimer **\n\nUse at your own risk, I cannot be held personally responsible for you or any outcome (paranormal or otherwise) from using this app!"

This \"Secret\" list reminds you of why you want more money in your life, and what it would actually feel like to have the things you desire most.\n\nPURCHASES: In this practice, you will change your mindset about money by spending large amounts of money in your imagination. Every day, you will receive virtual checks in escalating amounts from the Bank of the Universe, as first introduced in The Secret book. Using your imagination, you “spend” each check on whatever you want or need, and record these purchases within the app. Currencies are localised for each country and set according to the language and location setting on the phone or tablet.\n\nMANIFESTED MONEY: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have manifested money today - money you have received, saved, were gifted or refunded. You will be surprised by how much \"Secret\" money you begin to manifest every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS: When it comes to money, a little bit of inspiration goes a long way towards increasing the money in your life. In this daily practice, you will receive inspiring, financially themed messages drawn from The Secret books in order to help you change the way you think about money. Each inspiration is available to share.\n\nAFFIRMATIONS: Affirmations are positive statements that you make to create a positive mindset and change your life on a particular subject. In this daily practice, you will read 25 unique affirmations of wealth and abundance inspired by The Secret to help change your money mindset.\n\nGIVING: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have given to others - charitable donations, tips, gifts and giveaways, covering the check at dinner, or buying coffee for a friend.  You will be surprised by how much you give to others every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nThe Secret to Money was designed specifically for you as your invitation to use The Secret in order to live the life of your dreams. As Rhonda says herself:\n\n\"Like many people, I was brought up with the belief that money is hard to come by, and that you have to work really hard for money. I even had the belief that I would never have much money because my family didn’t have money.\n\n\"All these beliefs came from just one belief – a belief in a lack of money.\n\n\"So, in 2004, while researching for The Secret film, I created many different money practices and invented lots of imaginary money games in order to change my belief in a lack of money to a belief in an abundance of money. I committed to these practices, and did them every day. And today, there is no lack in my life whatsoever.\n\n\"The Secret team has taken my life-changing money practices that took me from lack to abundance and put them into The Secret to Money App. The App is simple, practical, and designed to radically change the circumstances of money in your life, as it did for me.\"\n\nAvailable in English, Spanish, German, French, Japanese, Korean, Hindi and Mandarin."

From Polynesian (Tahitian, Samoan, Tongan, etc.) tatau. In Marquesan, tatu.\" Before the importation of the Polynesian word, the practice of tattooing had been described in the West as pricking, painting, or staining. Sailors on the voyage later introduced both the word and reintroduced the concept of tattooing to Europe.\n\nThis is not to be confused with the origins of the word for the military drumbeat — see military tattoo. In this case, the English word tattoo is derived from the Dutch word taptoe (OED).\n\nThe first written reference to the word tattoo (or tatau), appears in the journal of Joseph Banks (24 February 1743 – 19 June 1820), the naturalist aboard Captain Cook's ship the HMS Endeavour: \"I shall now mention the way they mark themselves indelibly, each of them is so marked by their humor or disposition\".\n\nThe word \"tattoo\" was brought to Europe by the explorer James Cook, when he returned in 1771 from his first voyage to Tahiti and New Zealand. In his narrative of the voyage, he refers to an operation called \"tattaw\". Before this it had been described as scarring, painting, or staining\n\nTattoo enthusiasts may refer to tattoos as \"ink\", \"pieces\", \"skin art\", \"tattoo art\", \"tats\", or \"work\"; to the creators as \"tattoo artists\", \"tattooers\", or \"tattooists\"; and to places where they work as \"tattoo shops\", \"tattoo studios\", or \"tattoo parlors\".\n\n\nA tattooed man's back, Japan, c. 1875\nUsage of the terms \"skin art\", \"tattoo art\", \"pieces\", and work\" is gaining greater support,[citation needed] with mainstream art galleries holding exhibitions of both conventional and custom tattoo designs. Beyond Skin, at the Museum of Croydon, is an example of this as it challenges the stereotypical view of tattoos and who has them. Copyrighted tattoo designs that are mass-produced and sent to tattoo artists are known as \"flash\", a notable instance of industrial design. Flash sheets are prominently displayed in many tattoo parlors for the purpose of providing both inspiration and ready-made tattoo images to customers.\n\nThe Japanese word irezumi means \"insertion of ink\" and can mean tattoos using tebori, the traditional Japanese hand method, a Western-style machine, or for that matter, any method of tattooing using insertion of ink. The most common word used for traditional Japanese tattoo designs is Horimono. Japanese may use the word \"tattoo\" to mean non-Japanese styles of tattooing."

While our users contribute locations of their own, we comb the internet for pre-existing knowledge, seeking to unite the efforts of foragers, foresters, and freegans everywhere. Imported datasets range from small neighborhood foraging maps to vast professionally-compiled tree inventories. So far, this amounts to over 1,200 different edible types (most, but not all, plant species) distributed over nearly one million locations. Beyond the cultivated and commonplace to long-forgotten native plants and the exotic flavors of foreign plants, foraging in your neighborhood is a journey through time and across cultures.\n\nFalling Fruit is not associated with Fallen Fruit.

      "label": "The FOUNDATION FOR INNER PEACE, original publisher of \"A Course in Miracles,\" has joined with CDE Solutions to produce this app as an aid to those working on their daily lessons from the Workbook of the Course. -- NOW AVAILABLE IN 5 LANGUAGES: English, French, German, Portuguese and Spanish. As a student of the Course have you ever spent time studying your lesson in the morning only to forget to review it at the suggested time intervals during the day? Have you ever wished that you had reminders, preset at the required time intervals, to jog your memory? Have you ever remembered to review a lesson but forgot what words to use? If so, then this app is for you!\n\nIn addition to providing convenient access to the full text of the 365 daily lessons from the Course's \"Workbook for Students,\" THIS APP HAS BUILT-IN REMINDER ALERTS which have been preset with specific text to be remembered for the day and the time intervals as suggested within the lessons of the Workbook. For lessons that have no suggested time intervals, you can select a time interval of your choice. You can even override Course specified intervals to time intervals of your choice that fit in with your daily schedule. The app is simple to use. To begin you would select the lesson you are currently working on from a rotating \"wheel,\" then when the wheel stops on your lesson of the day you click on \"Full Text\" and you are presented with the full text of the lesson. Once your beginning lesson has been selected you will be presented with the same lesson when you return the next day. This allows you review the previous lesson, or move on to your daily lesson. The complete Workbook, including Introductions, can be accessed from the wheel. During the day, shortened text (the words suggested within the Workbook lesson to be used as the reminder that day) is presented when the reminder alert is sounded. These words can be changed to whatever words you would prefer to use instead. In addition, you can choose what sound you’d like to hear as a reminder, when you want the reminder to start, and when you want it to end.\n\nYou purchase the app ONLY ONCE for all devices.\n\nAbout \"A Course in Miracles\":\n\nThe Course’s teaching is based on the practice of forgiveness as the key to inner peace and the remembrance of God. While the app contains the text of the complete \"Workbook for Students\", it represents only part of the Course, a unique self-study metaphysical thought system.\n\nPublished in one volume, \"A Course in Miracles\" consists of three separate sections: \"Text\", \"Workbook for Students\" and the \"Manual for Teachers\". The \"Text\" section of the Course sets forth the theoretical concepts of the Course's thought system and thus provides the necessary framework to clarify the meaning of the \"Workbook\" exercises. It is therefore important to undertake the lessons in this app in conjunction with the writings within \"A Course in Miracles\".\n\n\"A Course in Miracles\" was received in its entirety over a period of seven years by psychologist Dr. Helen Schucman through an inspired process she described as scribing. In 1975 the Foundation for Inner Peace, co-publisher of this app, was chosen by Dr. Schucman to be the publisher of the only original edition of \"A Course in Miracles\".\n\nThe \"Workbook for Students\", contained in this app, includes 365 lessons which are designed to train your mind in a systematic way to a different perception of everyone and everything in the world. As stated in the Introduction to the Workbook: “The exercises are very simple. They do not require a great deal of time, and it does not matter where you do them. They need no preparation.” You are asked only not to undertake to do more than one exercise a day. You might however choose to remain with a particularly appealing lesson for more than one day."

      "label": "7 Advanced Binaural Dream Induction Programs in One App!  Dream Inducer combines soothing ambient sounds with powerful binaural sequences to synchronize your brainwaves with frequencies associated with 7 different levels of dreaming. * Universal iOS App for iPhone/Pad * Headphones or Earbuds must be worn for binaural tones to be effective.\n\n* Each program includes a sleep induction phase and then introduces progressively higher frequency Alpha, Beta, and Theta dream sequences to stimulate increasingly vivid dreams.\n\n* To combine Brainwaves and Ambience with Audio from Another App use the 'Ambience + Other App' background mode.\n\n* To use just Brainwaves and Audio from Another App use the \"Other App\" option for the Background Mode.\n\n** How Binaural Brainwave Entrainment Works **\nThrough the process of brainwave entrainment human brainwave frequencies can be synchronized with a  frequency associated with a target mental state.  These Brainwave frequencies are too low for the human ear to hear, however, these low-frequencies can be perceived by the human brain if two different audible frequencies are played separately into each ear with headphones or earbuds.  For example, the human ear can't directly perceive the 2 Hz Delta-wave frequency associated with deep sleep, but if you wear headphones with one side playing a 135 Hz tone and the other playing a 137 Hz tone your brain will perceive the 2 Hz difference between those frequencies as a periodic beat.  As you listen, your brainwaves will begin to match that frequency, inducing the associated mental state.\n\nDream Inducer improves upon basic binaural techniques by layering multiple signals and then assembling these into sequences of programs that combine to create extremely unique experiences."

Sick of being frustrated at your beloved friend? Remove this one frustration and love having your dog more! Puddle & Pile will quickly learn your dog's toileting patterns and alert you before accidents happen.\nWhen your dog relieves, simply bring out your phone and record the action. Over just a few days Puddle & Pile will learn when your dog needs to be outside and it will bark, so you can save your floor! Consistently responding to puddles and piles alerts by giving your pooch a garden tour will help you toilet train your dog quickly.  Record every success or accident and see how quickly praise outweighs frustrations.\n\n\n- Or why not just use it to remind you even with older dogs that outside time is needed.\n- Customize the background with your favourite pooch picture. It's your dog's App!\n- Grow together with more positive times\n- Share your dog's history with others who may be looking after them.\n- Share your dog's history with your vet if there are strange patterns for an easy diagnosis.\n- Inspired by a continual puppy raiser for Guide Dogs Victoria.\n- Thank-you for the positive feedback. Please rate this app positively if you find it useful. It helps more than you may think. :-)\n- ENJOY YOUR DOG!\n\nREVIEWS\nIt works - byOttlight - Sep 26, 2015\nI've been having a problem house breaking my 4 1/2 old puppy. I started using this app and she was accident free the first day. It's very accurate nearly to the minute she has to go potty. I emailed the info to the puppy class trainer. It's very easy to use.\n\nFantastic App!  - byHot K - May 6, 2014\nI LOVE this app. I really needed something to help me make heads or tails out of mine & my new puppies day so we could have a smooth, fun house training process. Well, this app provides that! It certainly delivers what it promises & more! The app is easy to use & fun. It sorts out all the patterns of our new Sproodle & I feel less stressed. Def give this app a try if you haven't house trained a dog before, or maybe even if you have :)\n\nGreat tool!  - bymanwdaplan - Apr 24, 2014\nAmazingly accurate at predicting my dogs needs. Also, a very simple and clean (and cute) interface that makes the training process much less frustrating.\nLove this app! \n\nbyJonasfann1 - Apr 20, 2015 - Really very cool for any owner of a new puppy! LOVE using this app!!"

The theory is that spirits can manipulate the sensors to choose the word that they wish to speak. The app sets a baseline for what is considered \"normal\" activity among the senors used. This baseline is then monitored for abnormal fluctations.

What a sight!\n\nThe app has Siri Voice shortcuts, and they can be used to set your home into Away or Home state using Siri on your Watch or iPhone, as well as to display the live feeds from your cameras.\n\nThe app supports Apple Watch LTE, and can work when the iPhone is not around - as long as the watch itself has internet access (either LTE or WiFi).\n\nThe app is fully functional with an initial purchase. The in-app purchases are used only for giving a tip to the developer.\n\nWatch Cam lets you monitor all your Nest Cams from the Apple Watch or the iOS Widget.\n• From the watch face, tap on the Watch Cam complication to open the app. Swipe left and right to view life feeds from all your Nest Cams.\n• One of the watch complications shows you the snapshot from the camera of your choice, right on the watch face. The snapshot updates periodically all on its own, so you'll have a recent view of your camera any time you look at the watch. Useful when waiting for that package to arrive.\n• On your iOS device you can swipe to the widget panel to see what's on all of your cameras.\n• View the continuously updated Live Feed from the camera in the watch app, the iOS widget, or the iOS app. The feed updates with a new image approximately every second on the iOS and two seconds on the Watch - may be faster or slower, depending on your network speed.\n• Use the digital crown on the Watch to zoom in and out, or tap the screen to toggle zoom levels.\n• Use the pinch gesture on the camera views in the iOS app to zoom in and out. Single tap toggles the zoom level in the iOS app and the iOS widget.\n• Turn the device to landscape mode to increase the camera views sizes.\n• Double tap on the Live Feed view in the iOS app or the widget to launch the Nest app.\n• Set Geofence around your home to reliably set the Home and Away state when you come and go.\n\nWatch Face Complications can display the following:\n• Snapshot from the camera of your choice that updates periodically.\n• Status of all the cameras - if the camera icon is green, it means that all your cameras are online and streaming. If it's dimmed, it means that some cameras are off.\n\nYou can long-press the Watch screen for additional functions, like setting the home/away status, or turning the camera streaming on and off.\n\nWhile the app's minimalist looks betray the simplicity of its operation, what they don't show is the amount of planning, design, development and refinement that went into it, ensuring it becomes something that is enjoyable to use and experience.\n\nPlease Note: Watch Cam does not collect any of your data. Your login information, camera feeds, and any activity - all of it flows exclusively between your devices and Nest. Author of Watch Cam does not receive any of it, at any point.\nThis app and its developer are unaffiliated with Google Inc. or Google Nest. Nest is a trademark of Google Inc."

It also provides a description for each phase, sign and mansion. You can navigate through the information in various ways — say, phase-by-phase, day-by-day or month-by-month - whatever is more convenient for you. \n\nPhases show you the energy of the day, signs — the mood of the day, while the void-of-course periods might tell you when it is better not to do certain things. Mansions were used by different cultures from the time immemorial, they tell for what a particular day is good or not so good.\n\nTo calculate the times, iLuna uses the time zone of the device on which it runs, so if your iPhone or iPod touch shows your current time correctly, iLuna's information is precise too.\n\nOnce any of the events reported by iLuna happens, you will get a notification, provided you allowed the app to send you notifications."

      "label": "Take note of life with Chronicle, a simple journaling app that offers more than bound sheets without overcomplicating the writing experience. \n\nFocused writing. Multiple photos per entry that you can move, resize, rotate - your words flow around them. A recent New York Magazine article cites research showing people experienced improvement in \"physical and mental well-being. They were happier, less depressed and less anxious\" after writing about emotional or stressful events for a few days.\n\nStart writing more, today. Reliable storage, autosave, and passcode lock protect your words; share or read them on your computer with PDF, text, and email export. You can also create backups and save them to other apps such as Dropbox, Drive, and Evernote.\n\nYour journal will never run out of pages, but you can manage different topics or years in separate journals with the notebooks add-on.\n\nTake a break from social networks. Write comfortably knowing you can find anything you wrote with built-in search. Search results include relevant snippets of text so you can easily find the exact entry you’re looking for.\n\nAccording to a Harvard Business School paper, taking 15 minutes to reflect on your work at end of the workday can boost job performance (the study's journaling group performed 22.8% better on a test than the control group that simply continued working).\n\nStart keeping a journal or diary. Organize chapters for a novel. Jot down notes and ideas. You can always export what you’ve written for safekeeping. \n\nWHAT OTHERS SAY\n\n* \"A great app - probably my favourite app on my new iPad actually.

Tap for a fullscreen, zoomable version.\n* Customize your journal's page color\n* Crisp PDF export preserves layout and photo placement\n* Export your entire journal as a plain text file\n* Fast search that provides context around keywords\n* Support for Dynamic Type means text is never too small to read\n* Extended keyboard makes it easy to insert timestamps into your writing\n* Turn word count on to see a total as you type\n* Optimized scrolling; scroll back a whole year in a few seconds\n* Set a password to protect your journal entries\n* Export single entries via email, with photos embedded\n* Quick launch. Chronicle remembers the last entry you were on.\n* Arrange your photos by dragging them; rotate with two fingers\n* Autosave and undo while you're writing\n\nEXTRA JOURNALS\n\nIf you need a way to organize your writing, get the Notebooks add-on with in-app purchase. The cover is styled based on your text settings within the notebook. Unlimited notebooks you can drag and reorder.\n\nACCESSIBLE\n\nNo need to squint. In addition to being able to adjust the journal's font size, you can change the system's Text Size from the Settings app to make the UI text in Chronicle easy to read. I've also added accessibility and VoiceOver improvements.\n\n\nThank you for all of the emails with compliments and suggestions!

Need to repeat the same count a number of times? This app let's you do exactly that!\nWorking on multiple projects simultaneously? No problem, just create multiple projects, and give each of them their own name. \nPrefer to work in silence? Use the option to turn of the tap-sound, easy! \nDon't like the color theme of the app? Change it, there are many different options to choose from, and if you become a supporter of the app, the icon will also take on the color you select!\nOh, and don't worry about your screen turning off, as it will stay on while you are using the app, without draining your battery!\nUse the widget on the today view for maximum convenience!\nIf you have suggestions or complaints, use the email button top-right in the app to contact me directly.\n\n____________________\nWhat others said:\n\"If you need a simple counter, this is the app for you. It’s simple and easy to use. I’ve tried others but keep coming back to this one.\" - Lunanator\n\n\"It’s so simple but perfect. I can keep all my project counts in one place!\" - Anna706\n\n\"I do one project at a time that would require a counter. This is the first I’ve seen that is really easy! I love it!\" - nurse195829\n\n\"I am a totally blind knitter and use voiceover to read my iPhone screen. I have long wanted a row counter that was accessible to me. I found it! Works perfectly, and the sounds confirm that I have added or subtracted a row.

Depending on your location, the application choose the appropriate calculation method and Fiqhi school. \n\nFor an accurate location, please ensure that your location settings and your Internet connection or your GPS are enabled!\n\nNote about App features :\n-------------------------------\nIf you are familiar with Salatuk in other platforms please note that this version DOESN'T SUPPORT some features like \"Turn Phone to Silent after Athan\". Other features like \"Full Athan\" and \"Custom Athan\" are supported only when the app is ope. This is because of technical limitations. We will try to fix it once iOS system allows it.\n\nNote about Athan :\n-----------------\nSalatuk remind you that it's time for prayer with a \"4 takbeerats\" instead of full Athan. Because of technical limitations, it's possible to play full Athan only if the app is open. \n\nAlso, if you have problems to hear the notifications, please make sure to enable the following parameters in your device :\n\n1) Settings>Sounds>Alerts \n2) Settings>Notifications>Salatuk \n3) Your phone is not on mute and volume is correct\n\nNote about Prayers times :\n-----------------------------------\nPlease note that we pay attention to ensure that the prayer times of Salatuk are accurate. However, in some countries those times may be not exact. In this case, please refer to the official islamic institutions or mosques in your country and adjust manually the prayer times in the application settings.\n\nSalatuk supports currently 3 languages : Arabic, English and French.\n\nTips for a better usage\n-----------------------------\n\n1- In order to refresh the prayer alarms, make sure to open the application once a week. Please do so also when you change your location or timing (summer time).\n\n2- The prayer alarms corresponds to 2 or 4 Takbeerats. If you want to hear the complete Athan you should open the app at the moment of the Athan.\n\n**********************************************************************************\n\nتطبيق صلاتك رفيقك للحفاظ على صلاتك.\nعن طريق تحديد موقعك  تلقائيا، بإمكان هذا التطبيق أن يعلمك بأوقات الصلاة وكذلك تحديد اتجاه القبلة. تطبيق صلاتك يستعمل عددا مهما من الطرق الحسابية  المعتمدة في أغلب العالم الإسلامي. اعتمادا على موقعك، يختار التطبيق طريقة الحساب والمدرسة الفقهية المناسبة. \n\nحول خصائص التطبيق \n---------------------\nإذا كنت ممن يستعمل صلاتك على أنظمة أخرى، المرجو الانتباه إلى أن هذه النسخة لا تحتوي على بعض الخصائص مثل \"التحويل إلى الصامت\" كما أن بعض الخصائص الأخرى مثل \"الأذان الكامل\" و\"إضافة أذان من الذاكرة\" لا تشتغل إلا إذا كان التطبيق مفتوحا. يرجع ذلك إلى بعض القيود التقنية الموجودة حاليا في نظام أبل وسنحاول دعمها حالما ترفع هذه القيود.\n\n\nحول سماع الأذان \n---------------\nمن ناحية  أخرى إذا كان عندك مشكل في سماع التنبيهات، المرجو التاكد من أن الإعدادات التالية مفعلة في هاتفك : \n1) الإعدادات > الأصوات > تنبيهات التذكير\n2) الإعدادات >التنبيهات > صلاتك   \n3) هاتفك ليس في الوضع الصامت والصوت في مستوى جيد\n\nحول مواقيت الصلاة:\n-----------------\nننوه إلى أنه رغم المجهودات لتدقيق مواقيت الصلاة التي يقوم بها فريق صلاتك، إلا أنه في بعض البلدان قد تكون المواقيت غير مضبوطة بشكل تام، في هذه الحالة نرجو منكم الاعتماد على المواقيت الرسمية في بلدكم أو المسجد القريب منكم، مع العلم أنه يمكنكم تعديل الأوقات يدويا في نافذة الإعدادات.\n\nنصائح من أجل استعمال أفضل \n-------------------------\n\n1- حتى يتم تحديث إشعارات الأذان إحرص على فتح التطبيق مرة كل أسبوع على الأقل أو عندما تغير مكانك أو يتغير التوقيت في بلدك (التوقيت الصيفي)\n\n2- تطبيق صلاتك يشعرك بدخول وقت الصلاة على شكل تكبيرتين أو 4 تكبيرات. إذا أردت أن تستمع إلى الأذان كاملا المرجو أن تفتح التطبيق أثناء الأذان."

EVP theory suggests that we can communicate with spirits or otherworldly entities on a recording device. The method that these spirits seem to be using is known as Sound Manipulation (Transform EVP). Though we are not exactly sure how this process is done we know that it involves the modulation of sound waves in a manner that will change it’s characteristics on to a recording device.They may also communicate in real time (Opportunistic EVP). Simply put, spirits can change sounds in order to form speech and therefor have the ability to communicate.\n\nFeatures:\n4 sound Banks\nOptional Microphone input\nAudio effects that are fully adjustable including Echo, Reverb, Noise Gate, and Pitch.\n4 Band Equalizer\nVisual ITC feature that uses the first ever Virtual Video Feedback method.\n\nThis paranormal app is made to work similar to that of a ghost box by providing \"raw audio\" that spirits can use to form speech. This device can be put on your phone so you can have it with you, you never know when you might end up at a haunted location. You have to work on building a connection with the other side. This will help improve your communication. \nDisclaimer:\nThere is no guarantee you will be able to communicate with spirits or ghosts. Results may vary. Use at your own risk."

When its wisdom is sought with sincerity and sensitivity, this ancient Chinese oracle will promote success and good fortune and impart balance and perspective to your life. Its lasting popularity lies in the profound lessons it teaches about how reliance on one's higher qualities leads to life's greatest rewards: well-being, understanding, and peace of mind.  \n\nNow available as an elegantly designed and easy to use iOS app, it is both highly accessible to new users and a revelation to those long familiar with the text. Throw your own coins, or let the app cast for you, and make the wisdom of the sages your own. Includes a journal for recording your questions, results, and thoughts.\n\nBrian Browne Walker is the author of celebrated contemporary translations of the I Ching, Tao te Ching, Hua hu Ching, Wei wu Wei Ching, and Art of War which are published by Harper and St. Martin's Press and translated into over a dozen languages around the world. His \"I Ching, or Book of Changes\", long beloved for its clarity and accessibility, has received five star reviews on Amazon consistently for over a decade."

      "label": "The pendulum is used by many people who wish to enhance their ability to access their intuition. A common way to use the pendulum is to specify a few different movements to signify the answer to a question as 'yes', 'no', or 'maybe'.\n\nThis common technique is very useful but is limited if what you want to know is which choice among many is the correct one. For example, if you wanted to choose a color, you have to ask about every color in turn which could be very tedious.\n\nSome people have created paper charts to help with this problem. The chart has an array of choices, and the swing of the pendulum points to one of the choices. So you could put about a dozen colors on a chart and get a general color with one pendulum decision. To increase the color options, you could have color ranges on one chart that in turn indicate another chart with those colors as separate choices. There are books available that have charts that are hierarchical to serve this purpose. But using chart books is expensive and inconvenient. \n\nPendulum Charts Pro is an app that expands the power of dowsing with pendulums by providing comprehensive and interactive charts.\n\nThe number of choices you can make with one pendulum decision expands from yes,no, maybe to many distinct choices. With interactive charts, you can choose additional charts, thus enabling you to pick one choice from up to thousands of possibilities with just a few pendulum decisions. \n\nFor example, the Color Chart allows you to pick a color from over 1,400 choices in just 2 or 3 pendulum decisions.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nIn depth instructions on how to use a pendulum and use the app.\n\nBUILT-IN PENDULUM:\nWhile it is recommended one use a regular pendulum, the app has a built-in pendulum that may be used as an alternative. It works by detecting small changes in how level the device is.\n\nBUILT-IN CHARTS:\nYes/No & Numbers - yes, no, no answer, degrees of positive/negative, percentage.\nChakras - 7 primary chakras with descriptions of each\nDate & Time - Determine a specific date and/or time\nColor - over 1,400 colors\nLetters - choose letters, numbers and punctuation\nAmount - choose a specific in one of 16 different types of measurement\nYes Clockwise - yes, no, maybe, no answer\nYes Counterclockwise - yes, no, maybe, no answer.\nHawkin's Consciousness Map - levels of consciousness\nPeople - create lists of people, can draw from Contacts\nBaby Names - over 7,000 names\nLetting Go - process charts for letting go of unwanted patterns\nI Ching - do readings using the ancient Chinese Book of Changes\nBach Flowers - find the best Flower Remedies for out of balance emotional states\n\nCUSTOM CHARTS:\nYou can create your own custom charts. Also you can customize the colors in the built-in charts.  \n\nJOURNAL:\nKeep a record of your pendulum readings.\n\nFREE VERSION AVAILABLE\nPendulum Charts Lite is a free version that includes the basic features of the app.\nIt has a subset of the built-in charts listed above. Also it does not include the journal or the ability to add and edit charts."

      "label": "If you're involved with Christmas or Breeding Bird Counts, the boundaries of your count circle are always of interest, and sometimes unclear. Count Circle includes the complete National Audubon database of CBCs, with a total of 2883 different count circles in 93 different states and territories including Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean, South America, and Antarctica (updated as of December 2018).  Lookup and display any count circle on an interactive map, and find out exactly what is (and is not) included in the circle. The software also displays your current location, so you can determine precisely if you are inside or outside the count circle as you are doing your count.\n\nYou can also use Count Circle just to view the different circles, to help you decide which ones you might like to participate in. Display all the circles in your state with one click.\n\nIf you have reason to believe the database is in error, Count Circle lets you set the center of the circle, then update the database, and even, if you choose to do so, report the revision directly to National Audubon, who then review the update.\n\nYou can also create and save your own circles, and, combined with the ability to display multiple existing circles, this provides the perfect way to position a potential new circle so that it doesn't overlap existing circles. You can even choose the radius (in miles or kilometers) if you want to use something other than the \"standard\" 7.5 mile radius used for the CBC. A great addition for \"patch challenges\"!\n\nNote: some reviewers have noted errors in the count circle locations. The data in the app is the latest data direct from the National Audubon Society. Any errors in location stem from that database, NOT from the app! This is precisely why the app includes a feature that lets you report such errors directly to Audubon, so that Audubon can correct such errors in future updates of their database.\n\nNote: Notwithstanding the information in the previous paragraph, Count Circle is not affiliated with nor endorsed by the National Audubon Society. Christmas Bird Count is a trademark of the National Audubon Society."

I was inspired to create this app while participating in the three year program of the Foundation for Shamanic Studies.\n\nNote: This app does not teach shamanic journey practices. Visit the Mindful Bear website for links to shamanic educators, books, and practitioners."

      "label": "Osho describes Gautama Buddha as the greatest breakthrough in the evolution of human consciousness because his discovery of meditation shifted the focus away from praying to a god toward meditation; toward becoming alert to the potential of each human being for godliness. \n\nThe 52 cards in this deck comprise a thoughtful guide to understanding the Buddha’s important contribution to human enlightenment.  \n\nEach card contains a sutra, a commentary by Osho, and a beautiful image of a Buddha statue. \n\nReaders can first enjoy the words as poetry and allow them to evoke an intuitive, emotional response; they can then read Osho’s corresponding entry.\n\nA 53rd card, called Sammasati, represents the last word spoken by Buddha and an inspiring reminder of the readers’ own Buddhahood.\n\nIndividual sutras include Only Love Dispels Hate, Beyond Judgments, Neither Praise nor Blame, Conquer Yourself, Beyond Sorrow, Awake Forever and Shining the Way.\n\nThe app features the following:\n\n- All Cards\n- Sutra\n- Osho’s commentary on the Sutra\n- Discover the Buddha\n- Guide\n- Help\n- Share via Facebook and Twitter\n- Retina display enhanced\n- Save cards to favorites\n- Can be used off-line\n- Set your own notification time for daily readings \n\nThank you for continued feedback; please email mobile@osho.net so we  can continue improving. If you enjoy the app please leave us a store rating.\n\nABOUT OSHO\n\nOsho is a contemporary mystic whose life and teachings have influenced millions of people of all ages, and from all walks of life.  His often provocative and challenging teachings generate today more and more interest and his readership is dramatically expanding around the world in more than fifty languages. People can easily recognize the wisdom of his insights, and their relevance to our lives and to the issues we are facing today.  The Sunday Times in London named Osho as one of the \"1,000 Makers of the 20th Century\". He is known around the world for his revolutionary contribution to meditation – the science of inner transformation – with the unique approach of his \"OSHO Active Meditations\" acknowledging the accelerated pace of contemporary life and bringing meditation into modern life."

      "label": "Susan Miller’s Moonlight App features:\n\n• Know the times Moon is Void of Course at your current location and as you travel. \n\n• Explains the 8 phases of the moon (new moon, quarter moon, full moon, balsamic moon and, so forth), what each phase means, and how to take advantage of each phase by timing your actions accordingly.\n\n• It takes the moon 2.5 days to travel through one sign, so the app’s simple calendar reveals which zodiac sign the moon is traveling in for each day and the exact time it changes signs. Some signs that the moon travels through are especially favorable for certain actions—find out the details.\n\n• This app has no subscription—it is a one-time purchase. You get all the daily information you need through 2050.\n\nYou have heard the buzz on social media about “moon void of course” or a “void moon” (both have the same meaning). You may be curious about whether you should pay attention to when the moon is void of course. By knowing when a void moon is upcoming, you can schedule actions to avoid those periods to create the most successful outcome possible. It is an app you will use quite a bit—you will want to check it every morning. \n\nSome days the moon never goes void, other days the moon will go void for a few minutes, and still other days the moon will be void for several hours—possibly for the entire day or, in rare cases, for several days. Every day is unique, so the void is never repeated in the same way, the reason you need Susan’s Moonlight app. \n\nIf you schedule a meeting when the moon is void, it will either be cancelled, or the meeting will come to nothing. Things will go on as they have before with no change. You should not schedule a first date or a wedding during a moon void period, nor should you sign a contract, have a job interview, or meet with the press during a void moon, as examples. It would not be a good idea to buy an airline ticket during a void moon, for you may have to exchange it later. If your action is vital, avoid the void. \n\nThis is an aspect that affects everyone uniformly, similar to Mercury retrograde.\n\nWith Susan Miller’s new appealing app, Moonlight, void of course periods are easy to find, understand, and navigate. The information is written in Susan Miller’s signature warm, optimistic style, and she uses no astro-babble language to confuse you. Until now, knowing when the moon is void required looking up the moon’s void of course periods on tables that are listed by Greenwich Mean Time and converting to your location. With Moonlight, the answer is a snap on Susan Miller’s app.\n\nWhat is the moon void of course, and when does it happen?\n\nThe void of course period of the moon begins when the moon has finished meeting with the other planets and has made her last EXACT major aspect to a planet or the Sun. Just as importantly, the moon must still be moving within the same zodiac sign as she was when she started receiving the planets. Once she has met with them all and is finished, the moon will go void of course. \n\nTo be precise, the moon may make an aspect to another planet. It could be a conjunction, square, trine, sextile, or opposition. These are the aspects that were outlined by the ancient Egyptian astrologer Ptolemy. Ptolemy is considered the father of the Western astrology we use today, and we call these aforementioned aspects “Ptolemaic” aspects. You need not be concerned about knowing what these aspects mean—Susan Miller does the work for you.\n\nAfter the moon has communicated with other planets each month, the moon rests, and as said, that ushers in the void period. As she rests, the moon cannot lend any of her considerable powers to you. That’s not good for any of us. We need all the help we can get from the graceful moon on a daily basis."

Good luck.\"\n\n-- That's what I believe for this app.\n\n## Suggest new scenes\nWant to suggest new scenes? Visit @lightshue on Instagram and let me know!

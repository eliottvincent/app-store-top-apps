Just click start and begin asking your questions. When a response is detected by the app the words will show visually in the text box along with audible speech. When you have finished your session just click stop.

      "label": "Apple Watch, Nest Thermostat, and Siri. Together at last.\n\n＊ The app has Siri Voice shortcuts for seamless Siri control of your Nest, from the iPhone, Watch, iPad, and HomePod. It fully supports Apple Watch LTE, and can work when the iPhone is not around - as long as the watch itself has internet access (either LTE or WiFi).\n\n＊ The app lets you monitor and control HomeKit thermostats like Ecobee, and functions largely the same with them as it does with Nest, except for the Siri Shortcuts functionality which is not needed with HomeKit. It lets you see your thermostat info on the Watch complications, and control it using the iOS widget.\n_____________\n\n• Using Siri voice shortcuts you can control many aspects of your Nest, such as instant activation of heating or cooling, setting the temperature by saying how many degrees you want to set, increasing/decreasing the temperature, and setting the Home/Away state. Thanks to Thermo Watch, It's all finally just one casual \"Hey Siri\" away, all with informative visual and verbal feedback.\n• From the watch face, tap on the Thermo Watch complication to open the app. Spin the Digital Crown, or Swipe up/down to adjust the temperature. You can start adjusting the moment the app opens.\n• On your iOS device you can see the thermostat info on the home screen widget, you can swipe to the widget panel to adjust the temperature on the interactive widget, or you can just open the app. Again, you can start adjusting the moment the controls appear.\n• From your Apple TV, open the app, and swipe up/down on the remote to change the temperate.\n\nThe app is fully functional with an initial purchase. The in-app purchases are used only for giving a tip to the developer.\n\nThe app will let you know with a chime and a tap, that the thermostat has received and applied your command.\n\nMonitor your Thermostats and Home/Away status right from the watch face, using complications that update in the background, without having to launch the app.\n\nYou can use Siri on your iPhone, Watch, iPad, or HomePod to control any of your thermostats. Record phrases that make most sense to you, such as \"Start Heating\" or \"Make it Cooler\". If you have multiple thermostats you can control them individually, by saying for example \"Start Heating Upstairs\" or \"Start Cooling the Living Room\".\n\nVisit https://thermowatch.net/siri website for the detailed instructions of Siri operation.\n\nSet Geofence around your home to reliably set the Home and Away state when you come and go.\n\nThe app supports multiple thermostats in multiple homes - just swipe left and right on your Watch screen to access them, or see them all at the same time in the iOS Widget and the app. Fahrenheit and Celsius are both supported.\n\nBeyond that, you can press the Watch screen firmly for additional functions, like switching to a heating or cooling mode, setting the away status, choosing the active temperature sensor, or turning the fan on and off.\n\nWhile the app's minimalist looks betray the simplicity of its operation, what they don't show is the amount of planning, design, development and refinement that went into it, ensuring it becomes something that is enjoyable to use and experience.\n\nThermo Watch does not collect any of your data. Your login information, thermostat settings, and any activity - all of it flows exclusively between your devices and Nest. Author of Thermo Watch does not receive any of it, at any point.\nThis app and its developer are unaffiliated with Google Inc. or Google Nest. Nest is a trademark of Google Inc."

      "label": "Ravit is a fun app that enables you to discover inspirational patterns and yarns, update your projects and stash and browse and post to Ravelry forums from anywhere. It's super quick, and it's friendly. Ravelry on mobile has never been easier.\n\nFIND INSPIRATIONAL PATTERNS\nIf you’re not sure what you’d like to make next, Ravit lets you easily browse patterns, favorite them, download and view pattern PDFs, view project photos and browse a designer’s other patterns and pattern suggestions. \n\nAnd if you want to narrow your search, choose from dozens of filters including craft, availability, category, attributes, needles, weight and more. You can even combine multiple options with AND, NOT or OR. It's powerful, but easy.\n\nThere's so many beautiful patterns on Ravelry, and Ravit helps you find them easily.\n\nTAKE RAVELRY TO YOUR YARN STORE\nFind out which yarns you’ll need for a project. Check what yardage you need. Look in your stash to see if you’ve already got a yarn, or one that’s similar. And because Ravit is designed to work nicely on your iPhone or iPad with readable text and buttons you can tap, you won't be squinting as you find all the info you need when you're at your LYS.\n\n+ Search all yarns by keyword, filter by fiber, weight, attributes and many others, and sort by options including 'Most projects' and 'Highest rating'. Quickly view pattern suggestions and projects for a yarn.\n\n+ Access your stash offline. No wireless or cell signal in your yarn store? No problem! Your stash is cached on your device so you can search, sort and view your stash offline.\n\nSNAP, EDIT AND UPLOAD ON THE SPOT\nPerhaps you're making a project on the train to work, or relaxed on the couch at home - whenever you are inspired to share your WIPs, Ravit makes it easy to snap photos, enhance with powerful photo filters, and upload to Ravelry, all from the one app.\n\n+ Powerful Photo Editing Tools - enhance, crop, and adjust your photos before your upload and show your work in it's best possible light. You can remove blemishes, improve color balance, sharpen images and access many other pro editing tools all from within the app.\n\n+ Optimized for Ravelry - before images are uploaded, they're resized optimally for Ravelry, so you'll upload smaller photos (up to 10x smaller!) more quickly and using less data.\n\n+ More than just photos - you can update notes for your Projects, Queued Projects and Stash, as well as most of the other info such as yarns, yardage, skeins, colorways, and color for your stash, and progress, link to stash, rating, craft, and tags amongst others for your projects.\n\nIT'S ALL THE LITTLE THINGS...\nSo why use Ravit? It's all the the little, sometimes hidden touches which make Ravit shine. Here's a few of them.\n\n+ It's quick - if you tap on something, you go right there. \n\n+ Infinite scroll - smooth, continuous scrolling as you browse to find inspiration.\n\n+ Offline - whether you're commuting underground, or you're off-grid, Ravit lets you access your Projects and Stash offline.\n\n+ Clean, uncluttered interface - we want your work and the beauty of Ravelry.com to shine. \n\n+ Use up to 50%* less data in Ravit compared with your web browser. \n\n+ Squint less - The text in Ravit isn't made super small, and we're fully Dynamic Type compatible, so if you change the font size on your device, it'll change in Ravit.\n\n* Based on tests of browsing patterns, projects, stash and yarns on Ravit and Safari on the same device - YYMV! (Your Yardage May Vary)\n\nTHIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING\nRavit has many features already, but we are constantly enhancing and adding more features. We have an active group on Ravelry and we'd love to hear what you'd like to see next - join in the discussion at http://www.ravelry.com/groups/ravit\n\nRavit is not affiliated with ravelry.com. It is an independent app, developed by a husband and wife team. You can read more about why we made Ravit at http://www.enhancient.com/ravit\n\nDownload Ravit now and hop on to Ravelry."

What a sight!\n\nThe app has Siri Voice shortcuts, and they can be used to set your home into Away or Home state using Siri on your Watch or iPhone, as well as to display the live feeds from your cameras.\n\nThe app supports Apple Watch LTE, and can work when the iPhone is not around - as long as the watch itself has internet access (either LTE or WiFi).\n\nThe app is fully functional with an initial purchase. The in-app purchases are used only for giving a tip to the developer.\n\nWatch Cam lets you monitor all your Nest Cams from the Apple Watch or the iOS Widget.\n• From the watch face, tap on the Watch Cam complication to open the app. Swipe left and right to view life feeds from all your Nest Cams.\n• One of the watch complications shows you the snapshot from the camera of your choice, right on the watch face. The snapshot updates periodically all on its own, so you'll have a recent view of your camera any time you look at the watch. Useful when waiting for that package to arrive.\n• On your iOS device you can swipe to the widget panel to see what's on all of your cameras.\n• View the continuously updated Live Feed from the camera in the watch app, the iOS widget, or the iOS app. The feed updates with a new image approximately every second on the iOS and two seconds on the Watch - may be faster or slower, depending on your network speed.\n• Use the digital crown on the Watch to zoom in and out, or tap the screen to toggle zoom levels.\n• Use the pinch gesture on the camera views in the iOS app to zoom in and out. Single tap toggles the zoom level in the iOS app and the iOS widget.\n• Turn the device to landscape mode to increase the camera views sizes.\n• Double tap on the Live Feed view in the iOS app or the widget to launch the Nest app.\n• Set Geofence around your home to reliably set the Home and Away state when you come and go.\n\nWatch Face Complications can display the following:\n• Snapshot from the camera of your choice that updates periodically.\n• Status of all the cameras - if the camera icon is green, it means that all your cameras are online and streaming. If it's dimmed, it means that some cameras are off.\n\nYou can long-press the Watch screen for additional functions, like setting the home/away status, or turning the camera streaming on and off.\n\nWhile the app's minimalist looks betray the simplicity of its operation, what they don't show is the amount of planning, design, development and refinement that went into it, ensuring it becomes something that is enjoyable to use and experience.\n\nPlease Note: Watch Cam does not collect any of your data. Your login information, camera feeds, and any activity - all of it flows exclusively between your devices and Nest. Author of Watch Cam does not receive any of it, at any point.\nThis app and its developer are unaffiliated with Google Inc. or Google Nest. Nest is a trademark of Google Inc."

      "label": "The Secret to Money is an app that is designed to change the way you think about money, and to radically change the circumstances of money in your life.\n\nInspired by Rhonda Byrne's worldwide best selling phenomenon, The Secret, in this app you will develop a whole new perspective on your own personal finances and potential to live a life of abundance.\n\nThe Secret to Money is a personal development program of games and daily activities created by Rhonda Byrne herself, featuring 6 powerful Secret-inspired practices that will help you develop a wealth mindset:\n\nDESIRES\nPURCHASES\nMANIFESTED MONEY\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS\nAFFIRMATIONS\nGIVING\n\nDESIRES: In this practice, you create a list of 7 things you would buy if money were no object. This \"Secret\" list reminds you of why you want more money in your life, and what it would actually feel like to have the things you desire most.\n\nPURCHASES: In this practice, you will change your mindset about money by spending large amounts of money in your imagination. Every day, you will receive virtual checks in escalating amounts from the Bank of the Universe, as first introduced in The Secret book. Using your imagination, you “spend” each check on whatever you want or need, and record these purchases within the app. Currencies are localised for each country and set according to the language and location setting on the phone or tablet.\n\nMANIFESTED MONEY: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have manifested money today - money you have received, saved, were gifted or refunded. You will be surprised by how much \"Secret\" money you begin to manifest every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS: When it comes to money, a little bit of inspiration goes a long way towards increasing the money in your life. In this daily practice, you will receive inspiring, financially themed messages drawn from The Secret books in order to help you change the way you think about money. Each inspiration is available to share.\n\nAFFIRMATIONS: Affirmations are positive statements that you make to create a positive mindset and change your life on a particular subject. In this daily practice, you will read 25 unique affirmations of wealth and abundance inspired by The Secret to help change your money mindset.\n\nGIVING: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have given to others - charitable donations, tips, gifts and giveaways, covering the check at dinner, or buying coffee for a friend.  You will be surprised by how much you give to others every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nThe Secret to Money was designed specifically for you as your invitation to use The Secret in order to live the life of your dreams. As Rhonda says herself:\n\n\"Like many people, I was brought up with the belief that money is hard to come by, and that you have to work really hard for money. I even had the belief that I would never have much money because my family didn’t have money.\n\n\"All these beliefs came from just one belief – a belief in a lack of money.\n\n\"So, in 2004, while researching for The Secret film, I created many different money practices and invented lots of imaginary money games in order to change my belief in a lack of money to a belief in an abundance of money. I committed to these practices, and did them every day. And today, there is no lack in my life whatsoever.\n\n\"The Secret team has taken my life-changing money practices that took me from lack to abundance and put them into The Secret to Money App. The App is simple, practical, and designed to radically change the circumstances of money in your life, as it did for me.\"\n\nAvailable in English, Spanish, German, French, Japanese, Korean, Hindi and Mandarin."

Nothing is stored in \"the cloud\" where it could be hacked. \n\nThe Vault 4th Step Inventory App allows you to enter your inventory information in a logical step by step way, then saves the information in an inventory spreadsheet that is laid out much like many of the 4th Step guides that you can find on the internet (like Joe and Charlie’s).  The difference is that the Vault app lets you work on your 4th step anywhere, anytime that you are free and in a safe place, NOT just when you are free at your home with your notebook.  It is Vault Code protected at all times, so whether it is on your nightstand or at the coffee shop, NO ONE can access your inventory but you. \n\nWe decided (through much discussion) to minimize all instructions on HOW to do a 4th Step. As alcoholics, we had no shortage of opinions on what each of us believed were the best instructions. We decided to use the original text from the Big Book for the actual questions for you to answer, instead of rewording them as we saw some of the 4th Step \"guides\" do. \n\nYour sponsor may want you to write out (with pen and paper) your 4th step. If that is the case, you may still utilize the app to collect your inventory information, then after printing it out, copy it over by hand.  \n\nThis app is not AA reviewed or approved. AA does not endorse or approve anything or anyone. All quotes are from the 1st edition of the Big Book.  This app was created by members for members. Thanks to their generous support this app is FREE to anyone world-wide. Remember: Our primary purpose is to stay sober, and help another alcoholic.\n\nThanks,\n\nTwelve Step Apps\nwww.12StepApps.org"

      "label": "Pleasure Machine is a simple erotic game for couples with slot machine interface, and is ideal for heating up your foreplay.\n \nThe erotic slot machine features three rotating reels with displayed parts of the human body, erotic activities and time limits. By starting the slot machine, the first partner sets all three reels in motion. After the reels come to a halt, he/she can already look forward to the sweet prize - a random erotic experience being the combination of the activity, at which bodypart to be performed, and for how long. The partners take turns and so after the activity is over the other partner pushes the SPIN button and awaits his/her erotic price.\n \nBut be careful, because it is not always clear who is going to please whom. Each turn is a thrilling experience right to the last moment thanks to the negative time values on the time limit reel. When the negative time limit appears, the partner who spun the reels will treat his/her partner.\n \nIn this game, you can either use the provided slot machines or create your own. You can change the slot machines during the game to accommodate your taste for the softer or more daring tasks.   \n \nFor the quick start, there are five predefined erotic slot machines available, carefully created to avoid unreal combinations. You can adjust each slot machine to suit your preferences, and also to create your own.  There are many possibilities to think of and it’s up to you and your imagination which stimulating combinations you will create.\n \nThis erotic game is suitable for all couples regardless of their sexual orientation. Thus, each couple can spice-up their love life.  \n \nPleasure Machine is a game with erotic content and is for adults only. PLEASE DO NOT INSTALL IF YOU’RE UNDER 18.\n\nGame is also translated in Slovak, Czech and Polish language. You can set those languages directly in the game global settings."

Normally all of your genealogy information is locked away on your computer at home which isn't much use when you are out and about researching local records, or visiting locations such as graveyards, ancestral homes, or family reunions.\n\nThis is where GedView comes in.  Carry around your entire family tree on your iPhone, iPod, or iPad and have all the data about your ancestors and even current descendants at your fingertips.\n\nYou can quickly check up on family relationships, dates / locations of events, and record new information.  Despite the name GedView is not just a viewing tool.  This includes taking photos, or video anywhere and anytime you like without needing to worry about a potentially costly internet connection.   If using an iPhone, or a cellular enabled iPad you can even record your current location to add to any event.\n\nIf your tree contains lots of images you can even use GedView as a slideshow, showing all the pictures related to a given event, person, source, family.  You can also play back any home movies you have in your tree.  Media support is not limited to photos/video.  Support is also included for any other file type your iPhone, iPod, or iPad is capable of opening.  This may be PDFs, Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, mp3 files.  If you have an app installed that supports a specific document type and have a document of that type in your tree you will be able to view it via GedView.\n\nDo you have some separate branches in your tree that you haven't connected yet?  GedView allows you to store multiple trees so you can easily switch to view distinct branches.\n\nUnlike other apps no specific computer application is required, nor is a subscription to any website.  Instead standard GEDCOM files can be imported,  These can be encoded as ASCII, ANSI, ANSEL, UTF-8, or UTF-16 and can be added to GedView via WiFi, downloading from a website, via iTunes, or even opened from other apps such as Mail, Safari, Dropbox etc.\n\nWhile GedView is targeted towards GEDCOM 5.5.1 it will read in any version, and will also support many custom extensions used by other genealogy applications, and because GEDCOM hasn't been added as an after thought imports are fast and efficient.\n\nYou can even export GEDCOM files for sharing with family members or other researchers, or to transfer new information to your main computer.\n\nA sample family tree containing the British monarchy is included.\n\nIf you have any problems, or suggestions please get in touch via the support email address."

There are also options for duration and tempo (slow, medium, fast) for each journey track.\n\nThis shamanic drumming application features Frauke Rotwein, who has been\npracticing shamanism since 1992. She offers classes, workshops, and private sessions, and is a shamanic healer at Omega Institute in Rhinebeck, NY. She has produced 3 popular shamanic drumming CDs, and a book with CD entitled \"An Introduction to Shamanic Journeying\"."

I love it!\" - nurse195829\n\n\"I am a totally blind knitter and use voiceover to read my iPhone screen. I have long wanted a row counter that was accessible to me. I found it! Works perfectly, and the sounds confirm that I have added or subtracted a row. The only thing that voiceover users want to know is that you need to double tap the pencil icon in order to make the project name text field active. This app is moving to the front page of my home screen! Thank you! Simplicity often means accessibility to me. Awesome!\" - ThaiFoodLady\n\n\"Its simplicity is great\" - hsbz. hsn \n\n\"i got it because i always forget to keep track of my stitches... it was so easy to use, i didn’t like the noise it made when you clicked it but i just turned it off. i also love how your able to choose what color you want!\" - milembh\n\n\"After trying several counter apps, this is by far by favorite.\" - H408\n\n\"I was looking for a counter app. Nothing fancy as I didn’t was one that took up a lot of memory on my device. Thus app is PERFECT. It’s super easy to use and a bit customizable too. If you are looking for a basic counter app, look no further. Thus app will meet your needs!\" - JB45840"

Depending on your location, the application choose the appropriate calculation method and Fiqhi school. \n\nFor an accurate location, please ensure that your location settings and your Internet connection or your GPS are enabled!\n\nNote about App features :\n-------------------------------\nIf you are familiar with Salatuk in other platforms please note that this version DOESN'T SUPPORT some features like \"Turn Phone to Silent after Athan\". Other features like \"Full Athan\" and \"Custom Athan\" are supported only when the app is ope. This is because of technical limitations. We will try to fix it once iOS system allows it.\n\nNote about Athan :\n-----------------\nSalatuk remind you that it's time for prayer with a \"4 takbeerats\" instead of full Athan. Because of technical limitations, it's possible to play full Athan only if the app is open. \n\nAlso, if you have problems to hear the notifications, please make sure to enable the following parameters in your device :\n\n1) Settings>Sounds>Alerts \n2) Settings>Notifications>Salatuk \n3) Your phone is not on mute and volume is correct\n\nNote about Prayers times :\n-----------------------------------\nPlease note that we pay attention to ensure that the prayer times of Salatuk are accurate. However, in some countries those times may be not exact. In this case, please refer to the official islamic institutions or mosques in your country and adjust manually the prayer times in the application settings.\n\nSalatuk supports currently 3 languages : Arabic, English and French.\n\nTips for a better usage\n-----------------------------\n\n1- In order to refresh the prayer alarms, make sure to open the application once a week. Please do so also when you change your location or timing (summer time).\n\n2- The prayer alarms corresponds to 2 or 4 Takbeerats.

Sick of being frustrated at your beloved friend? Remove this one frustration and love having your dog more! Puddle & Pile will quickly learn your dog's toileting patterns and alert you before accidents happen.\nWhen your dog relieves, simply bring out your phone and record the action. Over just a few days Puddle & Pile will learn when your dog needs to be outside and it will bark, so you can save your floor! Consistently responding to puddles and piles alerts by giving your pooch a garden tour will help you toilet train your dog quickly.  Record every success or accident and see how quickly praise outweighs frustrations.\n\n\n- Or why not just use it to remind you even with older dogs that outside time is needed.\n- Customize the background with your favourite pooch picture. It's your dog's App!\n- Grow together with more positive times\n- Share your dog's history with others who may be looking after them.\n- Share your dog's history with your vet if there are strange patterns for an easy diagnosis.\n- Inspired by a continual puppy raiser for Guide Dogs Victoria.\n- Thank-you for the positive feedback. Please rate this app positively if you find it useful. It helps more than you may think. :-)\n- ENJOY YOUR DOG!\n\nREVIEWS\nIt works - byOttlight - Sep 26, 2015\nI've been having a problem house breaking my 4 1/2 old puppy. I started using this app and she was accident free the first day. It's very accurate nearly to the minute she has to go potty. I emailed the info to the puppy class trainer. It's very easy to use.\n\nFantastic App!  - byHot K - May 6, 2014\nI LOVE this app. I really needed something to help me make heads or tails out of mine & my new puppies day so we could have a smooth, fun house training process. Well, this app provides that! It certainly delivers what it promises & more! The app is easy to use & fun. It sorts out all the patterns of our new Sproodle & I feel less stressed. Def give this app a try if you haven't house trained a dog before, or maybe even if you have :)\n\nGreat tool!  - bymanwdaplan - Apr 24, 2014\nAmazingly accurate at predicting my dogs needs. Also, a very simple and clean (and cute) interface that makes the training process much less frustrating.\nLove this app! \n\nbyJonasfann1 - Apr 20, 2015 - Really very cool for any owner of a new puppy! LOVE using this app!!"

      "label": "Susan Miller’s Moonlight App features:\n\n• Know the times Moon is Void of Course at your current location and as you travel. \n\n• Explains the 8 phases of the moon (new moon, quarter moon, full moon, balsamic moon and, so forth), what each phase means, and how to take advantage of each phase by timing your actions accordingly.\n\n• It takes the moon 2.5 days to travel through one sign, so the app’s simple calendar reveals which zodiac sign the moon is traveling in for each day and the exact time it changes signs. Some signs that the moon travels through are especially favorable for certain actions—find out the details.\n\n• This app has no subscription—it is a one-time purchase. You get all the daily information you need through 2050.\n\nYou have heard the buzz on social media about “moon void of course” or a “void moon” (both have the same meaning). You may be curious about whether you should pay attention to when the moon is void of course. By knowing when a void moon is upcoming, you can schedule actions to avoid those periods to create the most successful outcome possible. It is an app you will use quite a bit—you will want to check it every morning. \n\nSome days the moon never goes void, other days the moon will go void for a few minutes, and still other days the moon will be void for several hours—possibly for the entire day or, in rare cases, for several days. Every day is unique, so the void is never repeated in the same way, the reason you need Susan’s Moonlight app. \n\nIf you schedule a meeting when the moon is void, it will either be cancelled, or the meeting will come to nothing. Things will go on as they have before with no change. You should not schedule a first date or a wedding during a moon void period, nor should you sign a contract, have a job interview, or meet with the press during a void moon, as examples. It would not be a good idea to buy an airline ticket during a void moon, for you may have to exchange it later. If your action is vital, avoid the void. \n\nThis is an aspect that affects everyone uniformly, similar to Mercury retrograde.\n\nWith Susan Miller’s new appealing app, Moonlight, void of course periods are easy to find, understand, and navigate. The information is written in Susan Miller’s signature warm, optimistic style, and she uses no astro-babble language to confuse you. Until now, knowing when the moon is void required looking up the moon’s void of course periods on tables that are listed by Greenwich Mean Time and converting to your location. With Moonlight, the answer is a snap on Susan Miller’s app.\n\nWhat is the moon void of course, and when does it happen?\n\nThe void of course period of the moon begins when the moon has finished meeting with the other planets and has made her last EXACT major aspect to a planet or the Sun. Just as importantly, the moon must still be moving within the same zodiac sign as she was when she started receiving the planets. Once she has met with them all and is finished, the moon will go void of course. \n\nTo be precise, the moon may make an aspect to another planet. It could be a conjunction, square, trine, sextile, or opposition. These are the aspects that were outlined by the ancient Egyptian astrologer Ptolemy. Ptolemy is considered the father of the Western astrology we use today, and we call these aforementioned aspects “Ptolemaic” aspects. You need not be concerned about knowing what these aspects mean—Susan Miller does the work for you.\n\nAfter the moon has communicated with other planets each month, the moon rests, and as said, that ushers in the void period. As she rests, the moon cannot lend any of her considerable powers to you. That’s not good for any of us. We need all the help we can get from the graceful moon on a daily basis."

      "label": "The FOUNDATION FOR INNER PEACE, original publisher of \"A Course in Miracles,\" has joined with CDE Solutions to produce this app as an aid to those working on their daily lessons from the Workbook of the Course. -- NOW AVAILABLE IN 5 LANGUAGES: English, French, German, Portuguese and Spanish. As a student of the Course have you ever spent time studying your lesson in the morning only to forget to review it at the suggested time intervals during the day? Have you ever wished that you had reminders, preset at the required time intervals, to jog your memory? Have you ever remembered to review a lesson but forgot what words to use? If so, then this app is for you!\n\nIn addition to providing convenient access to the full text of the 365 daily lessons from the Course's \"Workbook for Students,\" THIS APP HAS BUILT-IN REMINDER ALERTS which have been preset with specific text to be remembered for the day and the time intervals as suggested within the lessons of the Workbook. For lessons that have no suggested time intervals, you can select a time interval of your choice. You can even override Course specified intervals to time intervals of your choice that fit in with your daily schedule. The app is simple to use. To begin you would select the lesson you are currently working on from a rotating \"wheel,\" then when the wheel stops on your lesson of the day you click on \"Full Text\" and you are presented with the full text of the lesson. Once your beginning lesson has been selected you will be presented with the same lesson when you return the next day. This allows you review the previous lesson, or move on to your daily lesson. The complete Workbook, including Introductions, can be accessed from the wheel. During the day, shortened text (the words suggested within the Workbook lesson to be used as the reminder that day) is presented when the reminder alert is sounded. These words can be changed to whatever words you would prefer to use instead. In addition, you can choose what sound you’d like to hear as a reminder, when you want the reminder to start, and when you want it to end.\n\nYou purchase the app ONLY ONCE for all devices.\n\nAbout \"A Course in Miracles\":\n\nThe Course’s teaching is based on the practice of forgiveness as the key to inner peace and the remembrance of God. While the app contains the text of the complete \"Workbook for Students\", it represents only part of the Course, a unique self-study metaphysical thought system.\n\nPublished in one volume, \"A Course in Miracles\" consists of three separate sections: \"Text\", \"Workbook for Students\" and the \"Manual for Teachers\". The \"Text\" section of the Course sets forth the theoretical concepts of the Course's thought system and thus provides the necessary framework to clarify the meaning of the \"Workbook\" exercises. It is therefore important to undertake the lessons in this app in conjunction with the writings within \"A Course in Miracles\".\n\n\"A Course in Miracles\" was received in its entirety over a period of seven years by psychologist Dr. Helen Schucman through an inspired process she described as scribing. In 1975 the Foundation for Inner Peace, co-publisher of this app, was chosen by Dr. Schucman to be the publisher of the only original edition of \"A Course in Miracles\".\n\nThe \"Workbook for Students\", contained in this app, includes 365 lessons which are designed to train your mind in a systematic way to a different perception of everyone and everything in the world. As stated in the Introduction to the Workbook: “The exercises are very simple. They do not require a great deal of time, and it does not matter where you do them. They need no preparation.” You are asked only not to undertake to do more than one exercise a day. You might however choose to remain with a particularly appealing lesson for more than one day."

Now featuring pro quality reverb, the famous \"Hindi\" based bank D, upgraded audio engine now recording mono wav 44.1 files, a whole new mode, reversed playback and more.\n\nThe learning curve for 3.0 is pretty steep for the new user.\nYou can also get help from me and over 1,000 other users worldwide at: www.facebook.com/groups/echovoxusers\n\nDEMO VIDEO IS IN PRODUCTION.\n\nPLEASE NOTE THIS SOFTWARE IS CPU INTENSIVE AND RUNS BEST ON NEWER DEVICES. \n\nECHOVOX System all-in-one Echo based Real Time EVP recording system from the creator of SpiritVox.\n\nEchoVox is a real-time amplified recording system used to create a bed of random chaotic noise using random phonetics, microphone input and a natural loop recording echo. Delay time can be set from anywhere to 0-10 seconds. This means what you are hearing is the actual audio being recorded to disk in real-time, as it happens.\n\nEcho has been shown to contribute to EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomenon)\n\nNote: The Echo is not a digital effect added to the sound. It is a loop of the actual recording. An external/BlueTooth speaker is recommended for the best results, also the louder the better.\n\nFEATURES:\nECHO WITHOUT RECORDING\n6 CHANNELS OF RANDOM PHONETIC AUDIO\n4 SOUND BANKS.\nSTUDIO QUALITY REVERB\n44.1 WAV REAL-TIME AUDIO RECORDING\nNEW \"BURST\" MODE*\nNEW AUTO BLEND/AUTO SHUFFLE\nMULTIPLE DELAY SETTINGS\nMIC GAIN INPUT CONTROL\nPLAY,FF,REW,SLOW,SPEED UP,REVERSE AUDIO FILES WITHIN APP FOR REVIEW\nUPLOAD TO SOUNDCLOUD\nFILE BROWSER\nNAME SESSION AT START\nCUSTOM REVERB PRESETS (.ievrp) CAN BE SAVED AND TRADED.\n\n*Random burst of random sounds from random banks for a random amount of time\n\n\nCONTROLS:\nEach channel has independent playback speed control + on/off.\n\nMic gain controls microphone input volume\n\n\"Auto Blend\" \"Shuffle\" blends across the 6 random audio channels\n\nEcho starts recording to disk.\n\nTHEORY: This is the result of years of experiments in the field, it is still a work in progress. The echo is actually a chaotic loop of the chopped up vocal samples and environmental sounds. A virtual soup of sound and frequencies impossible to predict.\n\nThis system has been used and tested WORLDWIDE. On live television in India and South America. Featured on televisions \"Ghost Trail\" and \"Seekers\" and more. EchoVox is simply the #1 most trusted and widely used app by both pro's and \"armchair\" paranormal investigators.\n\nEchovox is used by Barry Fitzgerald of TV's Ghost Hunters International and Bill Murphy of TV's Fact or Faked Paranormal files, Chris Flemming of Psychic Kids and Robb Demarest of Ghost Hunters International and other leaders in the paranormal field.\n\nEchoVox is NOT just an app, it is not a toy. \n\nIt is for use by serious investigators and is not for the casual user.\n\nThe best way to learn more about EchoVox:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/bigbeardaudio\n\nJOIN THE FB GROUP: www.facebook.com/groups/echovoxusers\n\nI support my work 100% and want to help you learn to use this correctly and help with any issues.

It also provides a description for each phase, sign and mansion. You can navigate through the information in various ways — say, phase-by-phase, day-by-day or month-by-month - whatever is more convenient for you. \n\nPhases show you the energy of the day, signs — the mood of the day, while the void-of-course periods might tell you when it is better not to do certain things. Mansions were used by different cultures from the time immemorial, they tell for what a particular day is good or not so good.\n\nTo calculate the times, iLuna uses the time zone of the device on which it runs, so if your iPhone or iPod touch shows your current time correctly, iLuna's information is precise too.\n\nOnce any of the events reported by iLuna happens, you will get a notification, provided you allowed the app to send you notifications."

      "label": "Want to display or send SSTV transmissions, without using a bulky computer? SSTV Pad lets you decode and display Ham (Amateur) Radio SSTV (Slow Scan TV) transmissions. Just connect your device to an HF radio (or even set it next to the radio's speaker), tune in an SSTV frequency, and watch the pictures. SSTV Pad decodes all of the popular SSTV modes, including Robot, Scottie, Martin, and more. Some modes are receive only. \n\nDecoding of SSTV transmissions begins automatically as soon as the start of image audio signals are detected, and the image format is automatically selected. Manual control is also available for use when receiving conditions are poor. Timing signals (phase and skew) can be adjusted to compensate for mismatches with the sending station. \n\nReceived images can be saved - including automatically as they are received. You can leave the app running unattended, and come back to view all the received images. You can review saved images, as well as send them via email, and use iTunes file sharing to transfer them to your computer. You can even share them on your Facebook page, or tweet them to your followers, directly from the app! (iOS 6 and later)\n\nYou can also transmit images, taken from your saved photos or taken with your device's camera. Text, such as your callsign, can be added to the sent image.\n\nBuy your copy right now, and start decoding and displaying SSTV transmissions in minutes. Just set your iPhone or iPad next to the radio speaker, and watch the pictures come rolling in.\n\nNote: If you cannot see the transmit button, go to the Accessibility settings for your device and turn Button Shapes OFF. It makes the buttons too large so you cannot see them all. \n\nAlso, It is very important to have a well tuned signal of good quality, and make sure you get the audio from your radio to your device without adding additional distortion, or auto start and mode detect will not work optimally. Please see this page for tips on using the app and connecting your radio: http://www.blackcatsystems.com/ipad/iPad_SSTV_Pad_FAQ.html\n\nYou can also use Bluetooth audio devices to feed audio into your device. Please be sure to use a good quality Bluetooth device, that does not distort the audio.\n\nModes supported for reception (not all modes can be transmitted):\nB&W 8 sec\nB&W 12 sec\nB&W 24 sec\nB&W 36 sec \nMartin M1\nMartin M1\nMartin M2\nMartin M3\nMartin M4\nMP73\" \nMP115 \nMP140 \nMP175\nMR73 \nMR90\nMR115 \nMR140 \nMR175 \nPD 50\nPD 90 \nPD 120 \nPD 160\nPD 180\nPD 240\nPD 290 \nRobot 12C\nRobot 24C\nRobot 36C\nRobot 72C\nSC-1 32 sec\nSC-1 16 sec\nSC-1 8 sec\nSC-2-60\nSC-2-120\nSC-2-180\nScottie S1\nScottie S2\nScottie S3\nScottie S4\nScottie DX"

      "label": "QuiltPaper creates graph paper for quilters. More than just a 1/4” grid — a tap does much of the ‘drafting' needed for quilt design by adding borders, sashing, cornerstones, diagonals for triangles, and more.\n\nStandard graph paper grids are included. For example, design an on-point quilt by starting with included Diagonal Paper. Make your own expensive, hard-to-find specialty papers and EPP templates: hexagon, diamond, triangle, HST & HRT templates, tumbler, polygon, eight and six point star, honeycomb (Lucy Boston), jewel, kite, brick, log cabin, square, circle, arc, and pinwheel by adding InApp purchases.\n\nQuiltPaper also makes it easy to work with inspiration images because you can place an image ‘just so’ under a grid by adjusting the image to fit!\n\nOnce a setting is complete, the design can be brought into the Paint Tool (with the inspiration image!) for coloring with solids and textures. While there is an extensive color palette available, unlimited custom color palettes can be created by — \n• Taking colors from images or live camera\n• Setting RGB or HSB codes\n• Selecting colors on the color wheel\n\nNOTE — If you are looking for a quilt block library, you will not find one here. QuiltPaper app is for quilters who use a grid to plan and design a quilt. It is worth mentioning, however, that a few in-app purchase papers use a Pattern Planner tool that offers at least a minimum level of block planning. These papers are Pinwheel, Arc, and Log Cabin.\n\nEnjoy English Paper Piecing? \nMake your own EPP templates. QuiltPaper can create shapes at the exact size you need for your project. You can even place a circle at the center of each template to cut a hole for easier paper removal. Once the template page is set, it can be — \n•Printed to cut templates by hand\n•Exported as a PDF or SVG to laser and pattern cutting machines\n\nHST & HRT paper (InApp purchase) lets you make your own at the exact size you want — \n• HST. Set overall size and seam allowance for template.\n• HRT. Set overall size and seam allowance for template with trimmed corners for easier, accurate matching during assembly (no ‘dog ears’).\n\nPURCHASE INCLUDES 3 PAPERS:\nGRID — Classic grid graph paper taken up a notch! \nDOT— Choice of 5 dot styles and 2 dot patterns.\nDIAGONAL — On-point design graph paper.\n\n— FEATURES OF ALL PAPERS —\n√  Buy once — purchase works on all devices — iPhone, iPad, iPod.\n√  Metric (cm or mm) and Inch settings for grid and page size. \n√  Paint quilt layout with color and pattern. Make your own color palettes.\n√  Place an inspiration image under any grid, then adjust size and placement.\n√  Up to four line colors on a grid.\n√  Put multiple grids on a page to plan block designs, assembly, etc.\n√  Title grid with choice of font, size, bold or italic, and color.\n√  Print on standard sized page (such as 8.5x11 or A4) or set a custom size.\n√  Avoid the headache of scaling a design by setting the page at the quilt actual size by using ‘Custom’ page size setting.\n√  Library of Quick Pick templates offer inspiration  and a short cut to creating layouts.\n√  Print or share grids as a PDF, PNG or SVG to other apps for further editing — even as templates to laser or pattern cutting machines.\n√  Share painted grids as a PNG or PDF. \n√  Work up close using pinch-n-zoom gesture.\n√  Place a center-point on most papers. \n\nIN-APP PURCHASES unlock specialty papers: \nTriangle\nHST & HRT\nTumbler\nDiamond\nPolygon (especially helpful to make shapes for EPP)\nHexagon\nHoneycomb (Lucy Boston)\n8 point star (Lone Star)\n6 point star\nLog Cabin\nJewel\nKite\nBrick\nSquare\nCircle\nArc\nPinwheel\n\n• ‘All Papers Forever’ bundle. For the price of five papers get them all! \nCredit is given for earlier purchases. On purchase of a fifth paper the bundle is instantly added.\n\nDon’t see the paper you need?

From Polynesian (Tahitian, Samoan, Tongan, etc.) tatau. In Marquesan, tatu.\" Before the importation of the Polynesian word, the practice of tattooing had been described in the West as pricking, painting, or staining. Sailors on the voyage later introduced both the word and reintroduced the concept of tattooing to Europe.\n\nThis is not to be confused with the origins of the word for the military drumbeat — see military tattoo. In this case, the English word tattoo is derived from the Dutch word taptoe (OED).\n\nThe first written reference to the word tattoo (or tatau), appears in the journal of Joseph Banks (24 February 1743 – 19 June 1820), the naturalist aboard Captain Cook's ship the HMS Endeavour: \"I shall now mention the way they mark themselves indelibly, each of them is so marked by their humor or disposition\".\n\nThe word \"tattoo\" was brought to Europe by the explorer James Cook, when he returned in 1771 from his first voyage to Tahiti and New Zealand. In his narrative of the voyage, he refers to an operation called \"tattaw\". Before this it had been described as scarring, painting, or staining\n\nTattoo enthusiasts may refer to tattoos as \"ink\", \"pieces\", \"skin art\", \"tattoo art\", \"tats\", or \"work\"; to the creators as \"tattoo artists\", \"tattooers\", or \"tattooists\"; and to places where they work as \"tattoo shops\", \"tattoo studios\", or \"tattoo parlors\".\n\n\nA tattooed man's back, Japan, c. 1875\nUsage of the terms \"skin art\", \"tattoo art\", \"pieces\", and work\" is gaining greater support,[citation needed] with mainstream art galleries holding exhibitions of both conventional and custom tattoo designs. Beyond Skin, at the Museum of Croydon, is an example of this as it challenges the stereotypical view of tattoos and who has them. Copyrighted tattoo designs that are mass-produced and sent to tattoo artists are known as \"flash\", a notable instance of industrial design. Flash sheets are prominently displayed in many tattoo parlors for the purpose of providing both inspiration and ready-made tattoo images to customers.\n\nThe Japanese word irezumi means \"insertion of ink\" and can mean tattoos using tebori, the traditional Japanese hand method, a Western-style machine, or for that matter, any method of tattooing using insertion of ink. The most common word used for traditional Japanese tattoo designs is Horimono. Japanese may use the word \"tattoo\" to mean non-Japanese styles of tattooing."

      "label": "Learn the Energization Exercises to awaken your inner source of energy!\n\nParamhansa Yogananda, author of Autobiography of a Yogi, created these exercises. Based on ancient teachings and eternal realities, Yogananda explains that the whole physical universe, including man, is surrounded by, and made of cosmic energy. We can, through the act of our will, release tension that blocks the energy flow to our body and mind, and draw on this infinite storehouse of life-force all around us. Through daily use of these exercises we can systematically recharge our bodies with greater energy and train our minds to understand the true source of that power.\n\nThe full set of Energization Exercises is comprised of 39 individual exercises. Once you become familiar with the routine, it takes about 10–12 minutes to practice.\n\nFeatures include:\n\n- Diagrams of all of the exercises\n- Optional detailed or brief audio guide for each exercise\n- A Principles of Energization Exercises e-booklet (press the \"i\" info button in top right corner of second screen to access)\n- A counter to track your progress\n\nThe app is based on the book \"Energization Exercises\" from Crystal Clarity Publishers.\n\n“The whole purpose of true exercise is to awaken the inner source of energy which we have ignored throughout our lives.”\n                                    -- Paramhansa Yogananda"

To sign up for a Light DJ subscription, including a 7-day free trial for new users, search for LIGHT DJ ENTERTAINMENT EFFECTS in the App Store! ***\n\nMUSIC VISUALIZER: Create the ultimate music listening experience. The app listens to your music and changes the effects based on the mood of the song. Lights get active during intense parts of a song and flowy with softer melodies and magically change colors at just the right moment. Special controls for Nanoleaf allow you to control rotation and fill angle to match your Nanoleaf panel orientation.\n\nSTROBE MAKER: Strobe your lights with 5 different types of effects with the Matrix Strobe Maker. Tap and swipe using using multitouch and 3D Touch (on supported models).\n\nBEAT-SYNCED EFFECTS: Use the Super SceneMaker controller for looping effects that sync to the beat of your music. Each of the 100+ effects can be customized with your favorite colors. Just turn on your lights and let the SceneMaker run all night long. Control the speed of your lights with precision manual tempo controls or auto beat detection using your device's built-in microphone.\n\nHUE ENTERTAINMENT: Using a Hue Entertainment area you'll enjoy higher quality effects; all of Light DJ's effects respond faster and with better sync. Send waves of color across your room with the updated Groove Wave effect, or strobe faster with the Matrix controller.\n\nEFFECT MAKER: Create your own looping special effects with our powerful Effects Maker. Share your custom-made effects and effect sheets with your friends using AirDrop.\n\nIPAD VERSION: The iPad app offers a DJ Controller-inspired design for ultimate live-performance lighting control. Configurable sheets allow you to setup your effects and colors in advance, and big push-buttons make rapid changes easy.\n\nMULTI-BRIDGE SUPPORT: Combine lights from two or more bridges using the legacy effects or control multiple simultaneous entertainment areas.\n\nABLETON LINK & MIDI SUPPORT: Seamlessly sync tempo with other apps & devices using Ableton Link or MIDI Clock Sync. Control effects by sending Program Change codes over MIDI.\n\n--- Light DJ vs Light DJ Pro ---\nWant the full experience without having to worry about renewing your subscription?

You'll get the same benefits as a Light DJ Pro Subscription user without having to keep paying:\n-Full use of all of the app's controllers and effects\n-Universal access & cloud sync\n-Continual updates to support new hardware and features\n-Direct email technical support (I respond to every email!)\n-For more details see lightdjapp.com/blog\n\nVisit lightdjapp.com for support or check out video previews at instagram.com/LightDJ\n\nThis app requires hardware from one of these vendors:\n- Philips Hue : meethue.com\n- LIFX : lifx.com\n- Nanoleaf Light Panels (Aurora, Canvas, Shapes, Elements) : nanoleaf.me\n\n---------------------\n\nHi, I'm Kevin, the creator of Light DJ Pro.

      "label": "Simple!\n\navAltimeter is a digital, aviation-oriented altimeter. It is the only altimeter app which has the Kollsman adjustment so you can adjust the altimeter to the current barometer setting, or to 29.92 inches of mercury for the pressure altitude. Need a quick backup for your panel? avAltimeter uses the latest Apple and Bosch technology built into the iPhone 6 and later models. Earlier models of the iPhone and iPads before iPad Air 2 or Mini 4 do not have the required pressure sensing hardware and do not work. All iPad Pro models work too!\n\nSmart!\n\navAltimeter calculates the temperature sensitive Density Altitude. Based on the Density Altitude, the app also calculates True Airspeed as a function of Indicated Airspeed. avAltimeter calculates a rough estimate of the increased required Take-Off distance from that at seal level from increased Density Altitude as well.\n\nIncreased Safety!\n\nKnow your oxygen requirements. avAltimeter tracks your altitude and provides a warning to use oxygen when you exceed FAA mandated limits.\n\nCustomizable!\n\navAltimeter is customizable. Choose Imperial or Metric units. Set the Altimeter Setting through a popup Kollsman window or by directly setting the field altitude.  The field altitude can be set manually or automatically by GPS. Select Day or Night  illumination. Turn the audio alarms for oxygen on or off. Improve the take-off performance estimate by selecting your propellor type: constant speed or fixed pitch.\n\nSensitive!\n\nThe Bosch sensor chip built in to the iPhone 6 and later is sensitive to changes in altitude of three feet or less and has an estimated range from -1500 feet to over 20,000 feet.\n\nUnique!\n\nUnlike other aviation apps, avAltimeter uses actual barometric pressure to calculate altitude, not a GPS estimate. The barometer is only available in iPhone 6 and later or the iPad iPad Air 2, Mini 4 as well as all iPad Pro!\n\nLegal Disclaimer\n\nThis is an app, not an FAA approved flight instrument. It has not been certified as meeting the relevant TSO specifications. This app can not be used as a primary flight instrument."

      "label": "The Spirit Talker works in a similar way to the world famous Ovilus device.\n\nIt produces words and speech based on what the sensors in your phone are detecting.\n\nThe theory behind this app is that spirits might be able to manipulate the device to say and show relevant words and responses to questions being asked during a paranormal investigation. \n\nThe Spirit Talker is a modern form of ITC (Instrumental Trans Communication) and is very simple to use.\n\nJust click start and begin asking your questions. When a response is detected by the app the words will show visually in the text box along with audible speech.\n\nWhen you have finished your session just click stop. You can also look back at the responses you received during your session by clicking on the folder button (this only works when the scanner is \"Stopped\").\n\nThe EMF Meter only works if your device has a Magnetometer Sensor. If not then the EMF Meter won't be displayed. Please check the compatibility of your phone / tablet.\n\n** Disclaimer **\nUse at your own risk.

      "label": "The Secret to Money is an app that is designed to change the way you think about money, and to radically change the circumstances of money in your life.\n\nInspired by Rhonda Byrne's worldwide best selling phenomenon, The Secret, in this app you will develop a whole new perspective on your own personal finances and potential to live a life of abundance.\n\nThe Secret to Money is a personal development program of games and daily activities created by Rhonda Byrne herself, featuring 6 powerful Secret-inspired practices that will help you develop a wealth mindset:\n\nDESIRES\nPURCHASES\nMANIFESTED MONEY\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS\nAFFIRMATIONS\nGIVING\n\nDESIRES: In this practice, you create a list of 7 things you would buy if money were no object. This \"Secret\" list reminds you of why you want more money in your life, and what it would actually feel like to have the things you desire most.\n\nPURCHASES: In this practice, you will change your mindset about money by spending large amounts of money in your imagination. Every day, you will receive virtual checks in escalating amounts from the Bank of the Universe, as first introduced in The Secret book. Using your imagination, you “spend” each check on whatever you want or need, and record these purchases within the app. Currencies are localised for each country and set according to the language and location setting on the phone or tablet.\n\nMANIFESTED MONEY: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have manifested money today - money you have received, saved, were gifted or refunded. You will be surprised by how much \"Secret\" money you begin to manifest every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS: When it comes to money, a little bit of inspiration goes a long way towards increasing the money in your life. In this daily practice, you will receive inspiring, financially themed messages drawn from The Secret books in order to help you change the way you think about money. Each inspiration is available to share.\n\nAFFIRMATIONS: Affirmations are positive statements that you make to create a positive mindset and change your life on a particular subject. In this daily practice, you will read 25 unique affirmations of wealth and abundance inspired by The Secret to help change your money mindset.\n\nGIVING: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have given to others - charitable donations, tips, gifts and giveaways, covering the check at dinner, or buying coffee for a friend.  You will be surprised by how much you give to others every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nThe Secret to Money was designed specifically for you as your invitation to use The Secret in order to live the life of your dreams. As Rhonda says herself:\n\n\"Like many people, I was brought up with the belief that money is hard to come by, and that you have to work really hard for money. I even had the belief that I would never have much money because my family didn’t have money.\n\n\"All these beliefs came from just one belief – a belief in a lack of money.\n\n\"So, in 2004, while researching for The Secret film, I created many different money practices and invented lots of imaginary money games in order to change my belief in a lack of money to a belief in an abundance of money. I committed to these practices, and did them every day. And today, there is no lack in my life whatsoever.\n\n\"The Secret team has taken my life-changing money practices that took me from lack to abundance and put them into The Secret to Money App. The App is simple, practical, and designed to radically change the circumstances of money in your life, as it did for me.\"\n\nAvailable in English, Spanish, German, French, Japanese, Korean, Hindi and Mandarin."

      "label": "Ravit is a fun app that enables you to discover inspirational patterns and yarns, update your projects and stash and browse and post to Ravelry forums from anywhere. It's super quick, and it's friendly. Ravelry on mobile has never been easier.\n\nFIND INSPIRATIONAL PATTERNS\nIf you’re not sure what you’d like to make next, Ravit lets you easily browse patterns, favorite them, download and view pattern PDFs, view project photos and browse a designer’s other patterns and pattern suggestions. \n\nAnd if you want to narrow your search, choose from dozens of filters including craft, availability, category, attributes, needles, weight and more. You can even combine multiple options with AND, NOT or OR. It's powerful, but easy.\n\nThere's so many beautiful patterns on Ravelry, and Ravit helps you find them easily.\n\nTAKE RAVELRY TO YOUR YARN STORE\nFind out which yarns you’ll need for a project. Check what yardage you need. Look in your stash to see if you’ve already got a yarn, or one that’s similar. And because Ravit is designed to work nicely on your iPhone or iPad with readable text and buttons you can tap, you won't be squinting as you find all the info you need when you're at your LYS.\n\n+ Search all yarns by keyword, filter by fiber, weight, attributes and many others, and sort by options including 'Most projects' and 'Highest rating'. Quickly view pattern suggestions and projects for a yarn.\n\n+ Access your stash offline. No wireless or cell signal in your yarn store? No problem! Your stash is cached on your device so you can search, sort and view your stash offline.\n\nSNAP, EDIT AND UPLOAD ON THE SPOT\nPerhaps you're making a project on the train to work, or relaxed on the couch at home - whenever you are inspired to share your WIPs, Ravit makes it easy to snap photos, enhance with powerful photo filters, and upload to Ravelry, all from the one app.\n\n+ Powerful Photo Editing Tools - enhance, crop, and adjust your photos before your upload and show your work in it's best possible light. You can remove blemishes, improve color balance, sharpen images and access many other pro editing tools all from within the app.\n\n+ Optimized for Ravelry - before images are uploaded, they're resized optimally for Ravelry, so you'll upload smaller photos (up to 10x smaller!) more quickly and using less data.\n\n+ More than just photos - you can update notes for your Projects, Queued Projects and Stash, as well as most of the other info such as yarns, yardage, skeins, colorways, and color for your stash, and progress, link to stash, rating, craft, and tags amongst others for your projects.\n\nIT'S ALL THE LITTLE THINGS...\nSo why use Ravit? It's all the the little, sometimes hidden touches which make Ravit shine. Here's a few of them.\n\n+ It's quick - if you tap on something, you go right there. \n\n+ Infinite scroll - smooth, continuous scrolling as you browse to find inspiration.\n\n+ Offline - whether you're commuting underground, or you're off-grid, Ravit lets you access your Projects and Stash offline.\n\n+ Clean, uncluttered interface - we want your work and the beauty of Ravelry.com to shine. \n\n+ Use up to 50%* less data in Ravit compared with your web browser. \n\n+ Squint less - The text in Ravit isn't made super small, and we're fully Dynamic Type compatible, so if you change the font size on your device, it'll change in Ravit.\n\n* Based on tests of browsing patterns, projects, stash and yarns on Ravit and Safari on the same device - YYMV! (Your Yardage May Vary)\n\nTHIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING\nRavit has many features already, but we are constantly enhancing and adding more features. We have an active group on Ravelry and we'd love to hear what you'd like to see next - join in the discussion at http://www.ravelry.com/groups/ravit\n\nRavit is not affiliated with ravelry.com. It is an independent app, developed by a husband and wife team. You can read more about why we made Ravit at http://www.enhancient.com/ravit\n\nDownload Ravit now and hop on to Ravelry."

      "label": "Apple Watch, Nest Thermostat, and Siri. Together at last.\n\n＊ The app has Siri Voice shortcuts for seamless Siri control of your Nest, from the iPhone, Watch, iPad, and HomePod. It fully supports Apple Watch LTE, and can work when the iPhone is not around - as long as the watch itself has internet access (either LTE or WiFi).\n\n＊ The app lets you monitor and control HomeKit thermostats like Ecobee, and functions largely the same with them as it does with Nest, except for the Siri Shortcuts functionality which is not needed with HomeKit. It lets you see your thermostat info on the Watch complications, and control it using the iOS widget.\n_____________\n\n• Using Siri voice shortcuts you can control many aspects of your Nest, such as instant activation of heating or cooling, setting the temperature by saying how many degrees you want to set, increasing/decreasing the temperature, and setting the Home/Away state. Thanks to Thermo Watch, It's all finally just one casual \"Hey Siri\" away, all with informative visual and verbal feedback.\n• From the watch face, tap on the Thermo Watch complication to open the app. Spin the Digital Crown, or Swipe up/down to adjust the temperature. You can start adjusting the moment the app opens.\n• On your iOS device you can see the thermostat info on the home screen widget, you can swipe to the widget panel to adjust the temperature on the interactive widget, or you can just open the app. Again, you can start adjusting the moment the controls appear.\n• From your Apple TV, open the app, and swipe up/down on the remote to change the temperate.\n\nThe app is fully functional with an initial purchase. The in-app purchases are used only for giving a tip to the developer.\n\nThe app will let you know with a chime and a tap, that the thermostat has received and applied your command.\n\nMonitor your Thermostats and Home/Away status right from the watch face, using complications that update in the background, without having to launch the app.\n\nYou can use Siri on your iPhone, Watch, iPad, or HomePod to control any of your thermostats. Record phrases that make most sense to you, such as \"Start Heating\" or \"Make it Cooler\". If you have multiple thermostats you can control them individually, by saying for example \"Start Heating Upstairs\" or \"Start Cooling the Living Room\".\n\nVisit https://thermowatch.net/siri website for the detailed instructions of Siri operation.\n\nSet Geofence around your home to reliably set the Home and Away state when you come and go.\n\nThe app supports multiple thermostats in multiple homes - just swipe left and right on your Watch screen to access them, or see them all at the same time in the iOS Widget and the app. Fahrenheit and Celsius are both supported.\n\nBeyond that, you can press the Watch screen firmly for additional functions, like switching to a heating or cooling mode, setting the away status, choosing the active temperature sensor, or turning the fan on and off.\n\nWhile the app's minimalist looks betray the simplicity of its operation, what they don't show is the amount of planning, design, development and refinement that went into it, ensuring it becomes something that is enjoyable to use and experience.\n\nThermo Watch does not collect any of your data. Your login information, thermostat settings, and any activity - all of it flows exclusively between your devices and Nest. Author of Thermo Watch does not receive any of it, at any point.\nThis app and its developer are unaffiliated with Google Inc. or Google Nest. Nest is a trademark of Google Inc."

With its large, highly visible font, you can check the time even from a distance. Also, in everyday life and at work, its modest matt black presence does not distract you or disrupt your productivity, even when using the app for extended periods of time. Its full-screen appearance integrates with the iPhone/iPad device body and blends into your living space ambience, as if it were a minimalist home decor item.\n\nFEATURES:\n- Switch between 12/24 hour clock\n- Switch between portrait and landscape mode\n- Option to show seconds when tapping screen\n- Brightness/dimness control inside the app\n- Show/hide background tiles\n- Enlarge/reduce to any size\n\nNOTES:\n- Your device’s Auto-Lock is disabled while this clock is active in the foreground.\n- This app does not start automatically like the Mac screensaver.\n- You cannot replace your device’s Lock Screen with this clock."

If you move the device after it has been calibrated you will need to recalibrate, simply click the \"Back\" button, move the device to a new area, then click \"Calibrate\" again.\n\nThere are 12 music box songs that his app randomly chooses from when it calibrates.\n\nThe sensors used are:\n\nMagnetometer - This senses Magnetic and Electromagnet fields around the device\nAccelerometer - This senses any device movement and the slightest vibrations around the device\nBarometer - Detects any change in the Ambient Air Pressure around the device\nCompass - Detects the slightest change in magnetic interference to Magnetic North\nGyroScope - Detects the slightest movement of the device\nOrientation - Detects the slightest movement to the position of the device\n\nIf your device is missing any sensors, the app will still work perfectly well without them.\n\n\n** Disclaimer **\n\nUse at your own risk, I cannot be held personally responsible for you or any outcome (paranormal or otherwise) from using this app!"

Whenever you're done answering a question, tap anywhere on the screen, and he will say his next line of dialogue.  Calls are automatically video recorded!  It’s that easy!\n\n*** #1 USA ***\n*** #1 UK ***\n*** #1 Canada ***\n*** #1 Australia ***\n*** #1 Ireland ***\n*** #1 Barbados ***\n*** #1 Mauritius ***\n*** #2 New Zealand ***\n*** #2 Venezuela ***\n*** #2 Chile ***\n*** #2 Malta ***\n*** TOP 5 Hong Kong ***\n*** TOP 5 Lebanon ***\n*** TOP 5 South Africa ***\n*** TOP 5 Cyprus ***\n*** TOP 10 Argentina ***\n*** TOP 10 Belgium ***\n*** TOP 10 Jamaica ***\n*** TOP 10 Guatemala ***\n*** TOP 10 Vietnam ***\n*** TOP 10 Nicaragua ***\n*** TOP 15 Sweden ***\n*** TOP 15 Norway ***\n*** TOP 15 Brazil ***\n*** TOP 15 Portugal ***\n*** TOP 15 El Salvador ***\n*** TOP 15 Sri Lanka ***\n*** TOP 20 Spain ***\n*** TOP 20 Azerbaijan ***\n*** TOP 20 Indonesia ***\n*** TOP 25 Jordan ***\n*** TOP 30 Mexico ***\n*** TOP 30 Egypt ***\n*** TOP 30 Taiwan ***\n*** TOP 30 Kazakhstan ***\n*** TOP 35 Italy ***\n*** TOP 35 Japan ***\n*** TOP 35 Switzerland ***\n*** TOP 50 France ***\n*** TOP 50 Romania ***\n*** TOP 50 Ecuador ***\n*** TOP 100 in over 50 Countries ***\n\n*** Spanish Language Version now available -- \"Videollamadas Con Santa\"!!! ***\n\nThere are three different calls to choose from:\n\n1) NICE CALL:  Use this any time of year, when your child has done something particularly nice, and you want to reward them by making sure Santa knows just how good they've been!  Kids love it and want to do more nice things, so they can call Santa again!\n\n2) NAUGHTY CALL:  Use this whenever your child has been naughty and you want to get them back in line by letting Santa know that they've been bad!  This really works and immediately gets kids back on track so you won't have to call Santa about them being naughty again!\n\n3) SANTA VOICE MAIL:  Santa answers his video phone with his cheery \"outgoing message\", saying he's sorry he missed your call!  Just wait for the beep, and you and your children can tell Santa anything you want!  Simple, fast, and easy!\n\n*** WATCH YOUR KIDS GO NUTS! ***"

Then you’ll love this expansion that contains a total of 100 new sexy challenges and 50 game-related actions.\n\nThe basic concept of this expansion is very simple: Each time you win a SMALL or HOT reward card in Bedroom Battle you also get to spin a wheel of fortune in the app, and hopefully win an extra reward in addition to the reward you select on the reward card.\n\nWhen you spin the wheel there are three possible outcomes: \n\nPINK - You get to select ONE of two random rewards. It can either be something related to the game or something a bit more naughty.\n\nYELLOW - You get to select ONE of two seriously sexy rewards. How sexy they are depends on if you've won a small or hot reward card in the game.\n\nWHITE - This is the one you don't want to win, as it means you have to choose ONE of two random PENALTIES instead of rewards.\n\nJust like in the base game all challenges in the app are designed to work for everyone – regardless of gender or sexual preference.\n\nPlease note that this app is an expansion for owners of the physical card game Bedroom Battle and NOT a stand-alone game. \n\nYou can learn more about Bedroom Battle and watch a video describing how to play here: www.tingletouch.com/bedroombattle"

When complete, you can print out your inventory for use with your 5th Step.\n\nFeatures\n\n- 100% Vault Secure \n- Complete your inventory by column or row\n- Has Resentment, Fear, and Sexual Conduct Inventories to complete\n- Type or speak your answers\n- Easy check-box answers for “Parts of Self Affected”\n- Prompt lists for jogging your memory for People, Principals, and Institutions.\n- Prompt lists and check boxes for common Principals,Institutions and Fears \n- 4th Step term’s definitions in Help section\n- “Set Daily Reminder” option using your iphones push notifications\n- Email inventories to yourself or sponsor securely in PDF format\n- Print them out in horizontal spreadsheet style for easy reading and organization\n- Hand write in any inventory information you want to in empty rows. \n- “Delete All” safety feature securely wipes the info from your phone when completed\n- App \"auto-locks\" Vault whenever app is closed or whenever iphone is left idle.\n- All data is secured on the iphone itself. Nothing is stored in \"the cloud\" where it could be hacked. \n\nThe Vault 4th Step Inventory App allows you to enter your inventory information in a logical step by step way, then saves the information in an inventory spreadsheet that is laid out much like many of the 4th Step guides that you can find on the internet (like Joe and Charlie’s).  The difference is that the Vault app lets you work on your 4th step anywhere, anytime that you are free and in a safe place, NOT just when you are free at your home with your notebook.  It is Vault Code protected at all times, so whether it is on your nightstand or at the coffee shop, NO ONE can access your inventory but you. \n\nWe decided (through much discussion) to minimize all instructions on HOW to do a 4th Step. As alcoholics, we had no shortage of opinions on what each of us believed were the best instructions. We decided to use the original text from the Big Book for the actual questions for you to answer, instead of rewording them as we saw some of the 4th Step \"guides\" do. \n\nYour sponsor may want you to write out (with pen and paper) your 4th step. If that is the case, you may still utilize the app to collect your inventory information, then after printing it out, copy it over by hand.  \n\nThis app is not AA reviewed or approved. AA does not endorse or approve anything or anyone. All quotes are from the 1st edition of the Big Book.  This app was created by members for members. Thanks to their generous support this app is FREE to anyone world-wide. Remember: Our primary purpose is to stay sober, and help another alcoholic.\n\nThanks,\n\nTwelve Step Apps\nwww.12StepApps.org"

      "label": "The FOUNDATION FOR INNER PEACE, original publisher of \"A Course in Miracles,\" has joined with CDE Solutions to produce this app as an aid to those working on their daily lessons from the Workbook of the Course. -- NOW AVAILABLE IN 5 LANGUAGES: English, French, German, Portuguese and Spanish. As a student of the Course have you ever spent time studying your lesson in the morning only to forget to review it at the suggested time intervals during the day? Have you ever wished that you had reminders, preset at the required time intervals, to jog your memory? Have you ever remembered to review a lesson but forgot what words to use? If so, then this app is for you!\n\nIn addition to providing convenient access to the full text of the 365 daily lessons from the Course's \"Workbook for Students,\" THIS APP HAS BUILT-IN REMINDER ALERTS which have been preset with specific text to be remembered for the day and the time intervals as suggested within the lessons of the Workbook. For lessons that have no suggested time intervals, you can select a time interval of your choice. You can even override Course specified intervals to time intervals of your choice that fit in with your daily schedule. The app is simple to use. To begin you would select the lesson you are currently working on from a rotating \"wheel,\" then when the wheel stops on your lesson of the day you click on \"Full Text\" and you are presented with the full text of the lesson. Once your beginning lesson has been selected you will be presented with the same lesson when you return the next day. This allows you review the previous lesson, or move on to your daily lesson. The complete Workbook, including Introductions, can be accessed from the wheel. During the day, shortened text (the words suggested within the Workbook lesson to be used as the reminder that day) is presented when the reminder alert is sounded. These words can be changed to whatever words you would prefer to use instead. In addition, you can choose what sound you’d like to hear as a reminder, when you want the reminder to start, and when you want it to end.\n\nYou purchase the app ONLY ONCE for all devices.\n\nAbout \"A Course in Miracles\":\n\nThe Course’s teaching is based on the practice of forgiveness as the key to inner peace and the remembrance of God. While the app contains the text of the complete \"Workbook for Students\", it represents only part of the Course, a unique self-study metaphysical thought system.\n\nPublished in one volume, \"A Course in Miracles\" consists of three separate sections: \"Text\", \"Workbook for Students\" and the \"Manual for Teachers\". The \"Text\" section of the Course sets forth the theoretical concepts of the Course's thought system and thus provides the necessary framework to clarify the meaning of the \"Workbook\" exercises. It is therefore important to undertake the lessons in this app in conjunction with the writings within \"A Course in Miracles\".\n\n\"A Course in Miracles\" was received in its entirety over a period of seven years by psychologist Dr. Helen Schucman through an inspired process she described as scribing. In 1975 the Foundation for Inner Peace, co-publisher of this app, was chosen by Dr. Schucman to be the publisher of the only original edition of \"A Course in Miracles\".\n\nThe \"Workbook for Students\", contained in this app, includes 365 lessons which are designed to train your mind in a systematic way to a different perception of everyone and everything in the world. As stated in the Introduction to the Workbook: “The exercises are very simple. They do not require a great deal of time, and it does not matter where you do them. They need no preparation.” You are asked only not to undertake to do more than one exercise a day. You might however choose to remain with a particularly appealing lesson for more than one day."

I started using this app and she was accident free the first day. It's very accurate nearly to the minute she has to go potty. I emailed the info to the puppy class trainer. It's very easy to use.\n\nFantastic App!  - byHot K - May 6, 2014\nI LOVE this app. I really needed something to help me make heads or tails out of mine & my new puppies day so we could have a smooth, fun house training process. Well, this app provides that! It certainly delivers what it promises & more! The app is easy to use & fun. It sorts out all the patterns of our new Sproodle & I feel less stressed. Def give this app a try if you haven't house trained a dog before, or maybe even if you have :)\n\nGreat tool!  - bymanwdaplan - Apr 24, 2014\nAmazingly accurate at predicting my dogs needs. Also, a very simple and clean (and cute) interface that makes the training process much less frustrating.\nLove this app! \n\nbyJonasfann1 - Apr 20, 2015 - Really very cool for any owner of a new puppy! LOVE using this app!!"

From Polynesian (Tahitian, Samoan, Tongan, etc.) tatau. In Marquesan, tatu.\" Before the importation of the Polynesian word, the practice of tattooing had been described in the West as pricking, painting, or staining. Sailors on the voyage later introduced both the word and reintroduced the concept of tattooing to Europe.\n\nThis is not to be confused with the origins of the word for the military drumbeat — see military tattoo. In this case, the English word tattoo is derived from the Dutch word taptoe (OED).\n\nThe first written reference to the word tattoo (or tatau), appears in the journal of Joseph Banks (24 February 1743 – 19 June 1820), the naturalist aboard Captain Cook's ship the HMS Endeavour: \"I shall now mention the way they mark themselves indelibly, each of them is so marked by their humor or disposition\".\n\nThe word \"tattoo\" was brought to Europe by the explorer James Cook, when he returned in 1771 from his first voyage to Tahiti and New Zealand. In his narrative of the voyage, he refers to an operation called \"tattaw\". Before this it had been described as scarring, painting, or staining\n\nTattoo enthusiasts may refer to tattoos as \"ink\", \"pieces\", \"skin art\", \"tattoo art\", \"tats\", or \"work\"; to the creators as \"tattoo artists\", \"tattooers\", or \"tattooists\"; and to places where they work as \"tattoo shops\", \"tattoo studios\", or \"tattoo parlors\".\n\n\nA tattooed man's back, Japan, c. 1875\nUsage of the terms \"skin art\", \"tattoo art\", \"pieces\", and work\" is gaining greater support,[citation needed] with mainstream art galleries holding exhibitions of both conventional and custom tattoo designs. Beyond Skin, at the Museum of Croydon, is an example of this as it challenges the stereotypical view of tattoos and who has them. Copyrighted tattoo designs that are mass-produced and sent to tattoo artists are known as \"flash\", a notable instance of industrial design. Flash sheets are prominently displayed in many tattoo parlors for the purpose of providing both inspiration and ready-made tattoo images to customers.\n\nThe Japanese word irezumi means \"insertion of ink\" and can mean tattoos using tebori, the traditional Japanese hand method, a Western-style machine, or for that matter, any method of tattooing using insertion of ink. The most common word used for traditional Japanese tattoo designs is Horimono. Japanese may use the word \"tattoo\" to mean non-Japanese styles of tattooing."

As you listen your brainwaves fall into step with this inaudible beat, and after several minutes synchronize with the target frequency. \n\nBrain Wave Altered State uses the most advanced multi-stage binaural sequences available, combined with the flexibility to choose from a range of relaxing ambient backgrounds, other audio apps, or your own iTunes Music, allowing your mind you to relax and synchronize with your desired state.  It achieves this using our unique process called Progressive Brainwave Entrainment.\n\n*** Progressive Brainwave Entrainment ***\n\nProgressive Brainwave Entrainment algorithms use layers of frequencies and carrier signals assembled in precise sequences to create profoundly unique experiences.  Each program gently brings your brainwave frequencies to your desired state using a more natural frequency progression.\n\n*** Advanced Features ***\n\n - 20 Brainwave programs each specially designed for a different situation and desired mental state.\n\n - 17 ambient background sounds to choose from.\n\n - Independently adjustable ambient sound volume.\n\n - Visual timer countdown indicator.\n\n - Automatic storage of preferred brainwave program and ambient background.\n\n - Ability to set your own custom program duration.\n\n\n* Programs Included *\n\n - Chakra Meditation:  A series of balanced, meditative brainwave programs each taking you to a different, deeper meditative state, ending in the ultimate state of meditation and calm.\n\n - Euphoric Bliss:  The ultimate brainwave program designed to gently bring your mind through a series of uplifting states, culminating in a state of euphoria and bliss.

The theory is that spirits can manipulate the sensors to choose the word that they wish to speak. The app sets a baseline for what is considered \"normal\" activity among the senors used. This baseline is then monitored for abnormal fluctations. To avoid having normal activity or handling disrupt the baseline we are using a modified version of a quantum fluctuation calculation that employs a new method with handling deltas. \n\nPlease note that the results of this application cannot be verified scientifically so this application is for entertainment purposes only."

Currently this includes an on-the-fly pitch tracker - so you can practise different ways of speaking and immediately see their effect - as well as unlimited archive space, celebrity comparison graphs, and a charting tool so you can track your progress over time.\n\nWe’re working to expand Vocular to other areas too.

      "label": "VISUALIZE YOU\n\nLet’s face it. Losing weight is tough. Months of calorie counting, denial and exercise and no clear idea of what you’ll look like after all that hard work. Finally, after years of research with the Cleveland Clinic and the University of Colorado Anschutz Health and Wellness Center, comes the first scientifically accurate, photographic weight change app, Visualize You. Unlike conventional photo manipulations that stretch or pinch images, the Visualize You weight change viewer modifies the volume of your neck and face based upon clinically verified weight change dynamics. The resulting image of the new you is accurate, photorealistic and represents your specific target weight loss goal, whether modest or significant.  \n\nHOW IT WORKS\n\nIn three easy steps, the Visualize You app transforms your image to show the dramatic effects of weight loss.  Alternately, you can set a heavier target weight to see the negative effects of an unhealthy diet and lifestyle.  To get started, simply upload your photo from your library or use your smart phone to take a photo of your current self. Information guides imbedded in the app will help you take the best resulting image. After entering your height, weight, and desired target weight, define and adjust your image using the intuitive touch screen controls.  Hit the ‘next’ button and, voilà, the new you will appear on your phone, providing inspiration and motivation to reach your target weight loss goal. You can even save and send the new you image to your support team of family and friends who will encourage you to achieve your desired weight goal.\n\nACHIEVING THE NEW YOU\n\nStaying on track with weight loss and achieving your ideal weight is not easy.  It involves creating an eating plan that you can live with rather than just another diet. Regular exercise and the consumption of healthy foods can lead to a host of benefits, including increased energy, happiness, health and even a long life.  Exercise and diet are pivotal in determining a person’s overall health, and making them both a part of your lifestyle can make a dramatic difference in how you look and feel. Visualize You provides a host of weight loss topics and guides to help you reach and maintain your new you weight goal including:\n\nArthritis\nBlood Pressure & Heart\nCholesterol\nDental Issues\nDiabetes\nDigestive Issues\nEating Issues\nEmotional Issues\nHealth Issues\nJoints & Mobility\nSleep\nSocial Issues/ Self Esteem\nWhat’s in it for YOU"

      "label": "The Spectre Box is the Official Haunted Finders Spirit Box App. Used by the Haunted Finders team and created as an affordable app that you can use for genuine paranormal research. To see this app is action please search Haunted Finders on YouTube.\n\nHow it works:\n\nThe Spectre Box is a sound bank Ghost Box containing over 3000 audio clips which are taken from AM FM CB CW VHF UHF, Morse, various Ghost Box recordings & phonetic audio from single words in many different languages some have even been overlaid & echo'd\n\nEach of the audio clips are no more than one second in length therefore making it very hard to create a full sentence. Because of this any words coming through should be totally unrelated to any question a person may ask. Therefore it should be pretty much impossible to have an intelligent conversation with someone or something. This is what makes this app so interesting. Spirits are supposed to manipulate electrical devices and use that energy to speak and that is how this app works. If a spirit wants to make contact they will use the phonetic and audio sounds to form words in order to form an intelligent conversation.\n\nThere really is no way to judge what will be said at the same time a question is asked. The best thing about it is because it uses more phonetic sound clips, we should be able to get foreign language usage & responses from it too.\n\nRECORDING YOUR SESSIONS\n\nWe fully advise that you always record or video your Ghost Box sessions using this app. 9 times out of 10 you will miss a lot of the intelligent responses in the moment and you will be shocked at some of the things you will hear on playback.\n\nJust be warned this app is not a toy or for the faint hearted, this can be a terrifying experience if you have never touched a Ghost Box before or even attempted spirit communication. So we recommend researching Ghost Box’s & spirit communication before deciding to try one for real.\n\n** Disclaimer **\n\nUse at your own risk. We cannot be held personally responsible for you or any outcome (paranormal or otherwise) from using this app!"

      "label": "Susan Miller’s Moonlight App features:\n\n• Know the times Moon is Void of Course at your current location and as you travel. \n\n• Explains the 8 phases of the moon (new moon, quarter moon, full moon, balsamic moon and, so forth), what each phase means, and how to take advantage of each phase by timing your actions accordingly.\n\n• It takes the moon 2.5 days to travel through one sign, so the app’s simple calendar reveals which zodiac sign the moon is traveling in for each day and the exact time it changes signs. Some signs that the moon travels through are especially favorable for certain actions—find out the details.\n\n• This app has no subscription—it is a one-time purchase. You get all the daily information you need through 2050.\n\nYou have heard the buzz on social media about “moon void of course” or a “void moon” (both have the same meaning). You may be curious about whether you should pay attention to when the moon is void of course. By knowing when a void moon is upcoming, you can schedule actions to avoid those periods to create the most successful outcome possible. It is an app you will use quite a bit—you will want to check it every morning. \n\nSome days the moon never goes void, other days the moon will go void for a few minutes, and still other days the moon will be void for several hours—possibly for the entire day or, in rare cases, for several days. Every day is unique, so the void is never repeated in the same way, the reason you need Susan’s Moonlight app. \n\nIf you schedule a meeting when the moon is void, it will either be cancelled, or the meeting will come to nothing. Things will go on as they have before with no change. You should not schedule a first date or a wedding during a moon void period, nor should you sign a contract, have a job interview, or meet with the press during a void moon, as examples. It would not be a good idea to buy an airline ticket during a void moon, for you may have to exchange it later. If your action is vital, avoid the void. \n\nThis is an aspect that affects everyone uniformly, similar to Mercury retrograde.\n\nWith Susan Miller’s new appealing app, Moonlight, void of course periods are easy to find, understand, and navigate. The information is written in Susan Miller’s signature warm, optimistic style, and she uses no astro-babble language to confuse you. Until now, knowing when the moon is void required looking up the moon’s void of course periods on tables that are listed by Greenwich Mean Time and converting to your location. With Moonlight, the answer is a snap on Susan Miller’s app.\n\nWhat is the moon void of course, and when does it happen?\n\nThe void of course period of the moon begins when the moon has finished meeting with the other planets and has made her last EXACT major aspect to a planet or the Sun. Just as importantly, the moon must still be moving within the same zodiac sign as she was when she started receiving the planets. Once she has met with them all and is finished, the moon will go void of course. \n\nTo be precise, the moon may make an aspect to another planet. It could be a conjunction, square, trine, sextile, or opposition. These are the aspects that were outlined by the ancient Egyptian astrologer Ptolemy. Ptolemy is considered the father of the Western astrology we use today, and we call these aforementioned aspects “Ptolemaic” aspects. You need not be concerned about knowing what these aspects mean—Susan Miller does the work for you.\n\nAfter the moon has communicated with other planets each month, the moon rests, and as said, that ushers in the void period. As she rests, the moon cannot lend any of her considerable powers to you. That’s not good for any of us. We need all the help we can get from the graceful moon on a daily basis."

      "label": "Learn the Energization Exercises to awaken your inner source of energy!\n\nParamhansa Yogananda, author of Autobiography of a Yogi, created these exercises. Based on ancient teachings and eternal realities, Yogananda explains that the whole physical universe, including man, is surrounded by, and made of cosmic energy. We can, through the act of our will, release tension that blocks the energy flow to our body and mind, and draw on this infinite storehouse of life-force all around us. Through daily use of these exercises we can systematically recharge our bodies with greater energy and train our minds to understand the true source of that power.\n\nThe full set of Energization Exercises is comprised of 39 individual exercises. Once you become familiar with the routine, it takes about 10–12 minutes to practice.\n\nFeatures include:\n\n- Diagrams of all of the exercises\n- Optional detailed or brief audio guide for each exercise\n- A Principles of Energization Exercises e-booklet (press the \"i\" info button in top right corner of second screen to access)\n- A counter to track your progress\n\nThe app is based on the book \"Energization Exercises\" from Crystal Clarity Publishers.\n\n“The whole purpose of true exercise is to awaken the inner source of energy which we have ignored throughout our lives.”\n                                    -- Paramhansa Yogananda"

      "label": "HOW IT WORKS\n1) Snap a picture of yourself in an outfit\n2) Add a rating and other details\n3) Repeat\nBefore you know it, you’ll be able to:\n\n• Find something to wear—search your outfits by Weather, Rating, Fit, Attire, and When Last Worn\n• Use keywords to search by anything else, like designer, trend, style, or brand\n• Plan your looks and remember what you wore (and who saw you)\n• Organize, search, sort, and learn about your items of clothing in the closet\n• Pack for a trip\n• Create custom collections, like “Favorite Spring Looks,” “Work Outfits,” or “Paris Trip”\n• Put outfits you want to wear soon “On the Runway”\n\n\nVALUE\nNo in-app purchases, no subscription, no ads, no hidden fees.\n\n\nIMPORTING IS EASY \nWe know it can seem like a lot to add all of your favorite looks and items, so we’ve made it easier. In addition to importing photos with your camera or gallery, you can also: \n• Download pictures of your items from the web\n• Crop item photos from your Look photos (game changer!)\n• “Share” photos to Personal Lookbook from your Photos app or another photo editor\n• Import a pic and add details later\n• Skip item photos altogether—just add a description\n\n\nCLOSET\nCategorize & search your items of clothing by Color, Category, Favorite & Keywords. Also:\n\n• See all your looks that include an item (for when you can’t remember what you wear with your navy Gucci jumpsuit)\n• Styling help—see all of your blue tops\n• See what items you wear most often; or what you wear with the most looks\n\n\nPACKING LIST\nGetting ready for a trip just got way easier. Personal Lookbook will generate an interactive packing list from any collection you mark as a trip. Then tap each item to mark it as packed. \n\n\nMORE PERKS\n• Add up to three additional photos per look: a back view, with a jacket, or a shot of you wearing it in real life\n• Widgets—see your latest looks & get inspired, right from your iPhone’s home screen\n• Set up custom days and times to get reminders to take a pic of your outfit\n• Share the looks and items you love\n\n\nWHY PERSONAL LOOKBOOK IS BETTER\nThere are many reasons Personal Lookbook is the best wardrobe app out there—easier importing, modern UI, easier to use, and tons of useful features (but not bogged down with unnecessary functionality that you’d never use). However, this is the big one:\n\nWith the other wardrobe managers, you drag your items together into “virtual” outfits that may not work when you actually wear them. This can be entertaining, but you never really know how an outfit is going to work until you actually try it on (it’s why we have dressing rooms and return shipping). With Personal Lookbook, you put your outfits together in real life, so you know they work and that everything will come together perfectly when you’re rushing to get out the door.\n\n\nHOW PERSONAL LOOKBOOK\nCAN CHANGE YOUR LIFE\n• Get out the door faster\n• Keep your IRL closet neat and organized\n• Look more stylish every day\n• Less stress when getting ready for a trip\n• Save money and the planet by wearing what you have\n• Have more fun with fashion!\n\n\nMORE WAYS WE’VE MADE IT EASIER\n• Example looks and helpful tips will help you get up and running\n• Item colors & categories are assigned to items automatically based on the words in your description\n• When adding existing items to looks, you can select from a searchable, sortable dropdown menu\n• Look details are optional—only add a rating if you want to be able to search by Rating\n• You can import a quick pic and add details later\n\n\nAUTOMATIC BACKUP\niCloud automatically backs up your data, so if you lose or replace your phone, you won’t lose your Lookbook photos and data. (Note that you can currently only use it on one device.)\n\nOPTIMIZED\nSupport for iPhone 12 and iOS 14. \n\nCONNECT\npersonallookbook.com\ninfo@personallookbook.com\nInstagram: @personal.lookbook\n\nLOVE YOUR LOOKBOOK?\nYour 5-star review helps more people discover Personal Lookbook and helps us continue to make it better for you. And we really appreciate it."

      "label": "7 Advanced Binaural Dream Induction Programs in One App!  Dream Inducer combines soothing ambient sounds with powerful binaural sequences to synchronize your brainwaves with frequencies associated with 7 different levels of dreaming. * Universal iOS App for iPhone/Pad * Headphones or Earbuds must be worn for binaural tones to be effective.\n\n* Each program includes a sleep induction phase and then introduces progressively higher frequency Alpha, Beta, and Theta dream sequences to stimulate increasingly vivid dreams.\n\n* To combine Brainwaves and Ambience with Audio from Another App use the 'Ambience + Other App' background mode.\n\n* To use just Brainwaves and Audio from Another App use the \"Other App\" option for the Background Mode.\n\n** How Binaural Brainwave Entrainment Works **\nThrough the process of brainwave entrainment human brainwave frequencies can be synchronized with a  frequency associated with a target mental state.  These Brainwave frequencies are too low for the human ear to hear, however, these low-frequencies can be perceived by the human brain if two different audible frequencies are played separately into each ear with headphones or earbuds.  For example, the human ear can't directly perceive the 2 Hz Delta-wave frequency associated with deep sleep, but if you wear headphones with one side playing a 135 Hz tone and the other playing a 137 Hz tone your brain will perceive the 2 Hz difference between those frequencies as a periodic beat.  As you listen, your brainwaves will begin to match that frequency, inducing the associated mental state.\n\nDream Inducer improves upon basic binaural techniques by layering multiple signals and then assembling these into sequences of programs that combine to create extremely unique experiences."

      "label": "The Dreams of Gaia Tarot is for those who desire unity within themselves, their relationships, and with heaven and earth.  It is for those who wish to explore, and develop a keener understanding of “self,” as well as those who seek to commune with the spirit realms and the Divine.\n\nThe philosophy of the cards is simple - to seek, to feel, to grow, and to heal.\n \nSeek – reveal the answers to the questions within.  Learn who you were, who you are, and who you wish to become. The tarot will help you communicate with the Divine, and your inner self; know your conscious mind, and explore the unconscious forces – the hard-wired beliefs and patterns that influence your behavior and choices.  Knowledge is power.  Self-knowledge and awareness are the keys to empowerment.\n \nFeel – delve into the watery realms of emotion, and begin to understand why you feel and react as you do. The tarot will help you shine a light on your emotions. It will allow you to explore their depths, and embrace the beautiful and powerful awareness that your responses and reactions are a natural part of who you are, but also within your power to control and change.\n​\nGrow – you are in a constant, cyclic state of growth and change. Growth and evolution are both inevitable and unavoidable, yet so many fear them, despite the fact that life itself is both a transformative and transmutative process. The tarot will help you to recognize and respond when a time of growth and change approaches, and to face it with increased confidence. You are here to live and experience life; to fear less and meet your fullest potential.\n \nHeal – there are experiences in your past that can do harm in your present because you have bound them to you by holding on to the emotions and beliefs they have fostered.  These bonds are the foundation of all that limits and restricts you in the present, and prevents you from moving forward with confidence and trust. Awareness will help you heal and let go.\n \nThe Dreams of Gaia Tarot will help you to rediscover your ancient and eternal connection with Gaia and the Great Spirit.  Regular use of the deck will bring insight and understanding.\n\nOfficial Blue Angel Publishing licensed app"

That means you need a network connection to use them.\n\nThis app is unique because it does all the celestial calculations internally! No internet required!  Find the start of night at your destination while you are still in the air!\n\nLots of features:\n\nFind sunrise and sunset at your current GPS location. Update sun calculations and sun dial every minute and every 10 km of movement.\n\nFind sunrise and sunset at any airport in the world (The app has built-in coordinates for 11,000 airports around the world)\n\nIf you are connected (WiFi or Cell Data), you can look up the twilight times at any address in the world.  Internet or cell access now also improves time zone accuracy.\n\nThe App calculates sunrise and sunset accurately forwards and backwards in time for 60 years.\n\nThe App calculates regular (standard) Sunrise/Sunset, Civil Twilight, Nautical Twilight, and Astronomical Twilight.\n\nThe App contains the relevant FAA regulations if you need a refresher!"

      "label": "The Better Part: A Christ-Centered Resource for Personal prayer,” by Fr. John Bartunek, LC, has already improved thousands of lives in its best-selling book form. Now the same practical and deep help for Christian meditation is available in an App!\nFr. Bartunek has created an extensive, Christ-centered resource to serve as a daily meditation companion. It is a Bible study on the four Gospels (included in full), a survey of saints' writings, a guide to prayer, and a fresh introduction to Jesus rolled into one. The Better Part enables us to read, meditate, absorb and apply the Gospels to our lives, and it serves as a catalyst to personalize times of prayer, enabling us to follow the Holy Spirit's lead into holiness.\nEach Gospel passage includes four commentaries: Christ as Lord, Christ as Teacher, Christ as Friend, and Christ in my Life. Questions for personal reflection and small group discussion are also included.\nYou can choose to go through “The Better Part” sequentially or according to the Liturgical Calendar.\nWe lead tremendously busy lives, with 1,001 things to do. Even so, every saint and renowned spiritual director through the ages has said the same thing: If we desire to become saints, we must spend time daily in meditation. With this App, you can make that happen in a powerful new way."

      "label": "Researchers at Monash University have developed the low FODMAP diet and a corresponding app to assist in the management of gastrointestinal symptoms associated with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The Monash University FODMAP diet works by swapping foods high in fermentable carbohydrates (FODMAPs), with low FODMAP alternatives. Around 75% of people with IBS experience symptom relief on a low FODMAP diet.\n\nThe app comes directly from the research team at Monash and includes the following:\n\n- General information about the FODMAP diet and IBS.\n- Easy to understand tutorials to guide you through the app and the 3-Step FODMAP diet.\n- A Food Guide detailing the FODMAP content for hundreds of foods using a simple 'traffic light system'. \n- A list of branded products that have been certified by Monash as low FODMAP.\n- A collection of over 70 nutritious, low FODMAP recipes.\n- Functions that allow you to create your own shopping list and add notes to individual foods\n- A Diary that enables you to record food eaten, IBS symptoms, bowel habits and stress levels. The Diary will also guide you through step 2 of the diet - FODMAP reintroduction.\n- The ability to adjust units of measurement (metric or imperial) and activate colour blindness assistance."

      "label": "Pregnant? This is for YOU!\nOur leading app allows you to use just your iPhone microphone to record and share your baby’s sounds. It is the best-in-class, has excellent reviews, is super simple and safe to use. Now supports Apple Airpods and Bluetooth Headphones.\n\n\"It took some time and patience... thank you for creating this cheap, awesome technology to use at home.\" - Niki\n\nCategory #1 in the USA and 102 other countries. Here's why...\n\nDeveloped by parents like you (with expertise in sound engineering and app development) who wanted a trustworthy, safe and easy-to-use way to record our baby's fetal sounds (kicks, heartbeat etc.) - and keep a record of a quality that we hadn't been able to find before in other apps. It has been extensively tested on expectant mothers.\n\n\"I was skeptical at first. Great app! Worth it.\" - Legretta \n\n**** But honestly, does it actually work?? ****\nYes. We've sound-engineered ways to attempt to isolate the baby's heart beat, sounds (kicks, heart beat and more) and using an advanced algorithm, amplify them making them easier to detect and hear.\n\nNOTE: It takes time, technique and patience and depends on the position and number of weeks of your baby so you'll need to stick with it. When you do, our results are excellent. Results are best between 27-40 weeks as your baby is bigger and stronger. \n\nWe constantly improve our extensive tutorial and techniques to handhold you through - we even have a support group on Facebook so you can get help.\n\nWe want you to be happy with Hear My Baby heartbeat and getting results can sometimes be difficult.  If you are struggling (can't find your own heartbeat etc. DO contact us via support. We want to help you!\n\nGIFT THIS APP: Click the “Buy App” arrow on the iTunes® App Store\n\n\nFAQs\n\n**** No Accessories Required ****\nWe use the internal microphone from your phone to attempt to listen and record your fetal sound. We recommend Bluetooth Headphones for best results.\n\n**** How It Works ****\n1. Hear My Baby, has been precisely engineered to listen to abdominal sounds, then record and amplify them. Listen to your own heartbeat first to confirm the app is set up correctly. \n2. It works best when baby is head down and their back is facing forwards.\n3. Remove the case, be in a very quiet room and focus on your lower abdomen. Listen then Tap record.\n4. Our simple recording management helps you to keep a record of your special moment\n5. Take a selfie if you wish and share \n6. We'll walk you through exactly how to get the best baby heartbeat results.\n\n**** Easy Share Feature ****\nSharing is awesome you can opt to share via Facebook, Whats App, Instagram or email.\n\n**** We Care About Your Privacy ****\nWe take your privacy and special moment seriously. You decide who sees or hears it and can delete it at any time.\n\n**** Before you start... ****\nYou DO need to carefully follow the instructions for Hear My Baby to work. A quiet room is critical for results as the mic is super sensitive.   HMB doesn't fake the baby heartbeat or other fetal sounds :) \n\nPlease Note: results are normally superb, however the recording may not work if your placenta is at the front of the tummy or the baby is in the wrong position.\n\n**** Supported Phones ****\n13,12, X, Xs, 11, 11 Pro, 8, 7, 7+, SE, 6s, 6s+, 6, 6+ 5c, 5s & 5. We don't support iPad.\n\n**** Worried about safety? We are too! ***\nHMB is safe but to be extra sure DO switch your iPhone to airplane mode. This is a precaution and automatically stops all cellular transmissions.\n\n**** Is it a substitute for medical devices/support? ****\nNo - under no circumstances is HMB a substitute for medical support - if you don't get a result it doesn't mean anything is wrong :) Consult your doctor for any advice. We are NOT approved by the FDA. This is not a medical device and is not a medical baby heartbeat monitor. It is for FUN.\n\nPlease do check our T&Cs before downloading.\n\nFor results examples: www.facebook.com/hearmybaby\nwww.instagram.com/hearmybabyapp"

The guidelines articles, as published in the Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease, as well as the comprehensive risk estimates, can be accessed through https://www.asccp.org/guidelines.  \n\nThese evidence-based management guidelines, initially developed in 2019, came together through a consensus process of 19 organizations. The updated management guidelines aim to:\n • Allow for a more complete and precise estimation of risk\n • Provide more appropriate intervention for high-risk individuals (detect and treat more precancer)\n • Recommend less intervention for low-risk individuals (decrease testing and treatment that won’t prevent cancer and may cause reproductive harm)\n • Allow for the future addition of new risk modifiers and screening and management technologies\n\nSee https://www.asccp.org/UserGuide for tips on using the app."

Simply enter the known variable and the data is instantly calculated. \n\nDeveloped by an Emergency Physician, this app minimizes the risk of medical errors allowing the provider to spend more time caring for the patient, and less time looking up and calculating doses.  \n\nIt is a critical companion for any physician, nurse, paramedic, or medical trainee involved in the care of critically ill pediatric patients."

      "label": "Meet Freya, your virtual birth partner from The Positive Birth Company! Freya will coach you through every single surge with a simple breathing technique and visualisation. She will help you relax between surges with a mix of guided relaxations, positive affirmations, gentle music and calming visualisations. Freya makes it easy for you to keep track of your surges and you can visit the log at any point to see how frequently your surges are coming and how long they are lasting. Freya will also let you know when your labour is established and when it might be a good time to contact your midwife. You will never birth alone with Freya by your side.\n \nTRACK YOUR SURGES\n\nIn hypnobirthing we refer to contractions as surges, as a ‘surge’ more accurately describes the sensation you’ll experience when in labour. Freya is the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the app store, designed specifically with hypnobirthing mums in mind, but can be used by anyone.\n \nPREPARE FOR BIRTH\n\nYou can also use Freya in pregnancy to help you relax and prepare for your birth. In fact the more you listen to the guided relaxations and positive affirmations, the more familiar they will become and the more effective they will be at helping you relax when it comes to birth. Positive affirmations have been proven to change the way your mind works and listening regularly will help you feel less anxious and more confident in the lead up to birth. \n \nTHE SCIENCE\n\nWe know the more relaxed you are during birth, the more oxytocin you will produce. Oxytocin helps your uterus to work efficiently, making labour faster and more comfortable. \n \nLIFESKILLS\n\nYou can also use Freya post-birth any time you feel you could benefit from taking some deep breaths or need some help finding your zen. Everything you learn through using Freya - mindfulness exercises, breathing techniques, the benefits of taking time out - are skills for life.\n\nIf you have any questions or spot any pesky bugs lurking about the place (!) please do let us know at help@thepositivebirthcompany.co.uk\n\nWHAT YOU’LL GET:\n\niPhone and Apple Watch app\nA timer to record your surges (also known as a contraction timer)\nCoaching audio to keep your mind focused on breathing through each surge\nA gentle expanding visualisation which you can use to sync your breathing\nA detailed log of your surges over time, so you can track your progress through labour\nAbility to easily share the log with your birth partner, midwife or doula\nGuided relaxations, positive affirmations and soothing visuals to help keep you calm and relaxed, making birth easier, quicker and more straightforward (can also be used in pregnancy and postnatally)\nCoaching created by renowned hypnobirthing expert Siobhan Miller, founder of The Positive Birth Company\n\nDownload the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the App Store and prepare to meet your baby in the best possible way, feeling calm and confident, relaxed and happy!"

      "label": "Blood calcium, vitamin D, and osteoporosis are important health issues. The consequences of abnormal levels are often life-changing and occasionally life-threatening. Using this app is the equivalent to spending hours with the world’s most experienced doctors teaching you about your calcium, parathyroid, osteoporosis, and vitamin D issues. Your tests results are analyzed to determine if a problem exists, what risks are associated, and what to do about it. Beautiful graphs make understanding these problems simple!\n\nBlood tests and bone density scans can be difficult to interpret—even many doctors do not diagnose calcium, vitamin D, and parathyroid problems correctly or timely. Hyperparathyroidism is a disease that affects 1 in 800 people and 1 in 250 women over 50 and is very often overlooked while patients suffer from chronic fatigue, memory loss, depression, osteoporosis, bone pain and many other symptoms. Calcium Pro is a powerful software program that will analyze your calcium health and provide you guidance about the status of your bones, kidneys, parathyroid glands, vitamin D, and other related health issues.\n\nYou start by entering your test results for calcium, parathyroid hormone, and vitamin D. Then we look at your bone density (osteoporosis levels). CalciumPro will analyze and graph your tests making them easy to understand. It will let you know the status of your parathyroid glands and your chance of having hyperparathyroidism. Suggested next steps are given. Tracking tools will show your calcium and vitamin D levels over time, and will show if your bones are losing density (worsening osteoporosis), or gaining bone density. There are important learning tools on every page, and an extensive video and reading library at the end. The app will provide guidance about talking to your physician regarding the possible need for surgery and other important steps.\n\nA Risk Assessment Tool shows your relative risk for conditions associated with high blood calcium: Osteoporosis, Heart Disease, Heart Arrhythmias and Palpitations, High Blood Pressure, Kidney Stones and Kidney Failure, GERD, several Cancers, and others. Watch your risk assessment graphs change as you address your calcium problems. \n\nThis app was developed by doctors at the Norman Parathyroid Center, the world’s leading parathyroid and calcium treatment center using over 4,000,000 data points from over 30,000 patients. Let the world’s leading doctors help you understand these problems so you and your doctor can make important, informed decisions. Take control of your own health!"

Based on extensive literature review, Ortho Traumapedia compiles the current standard of care in a high-yield, easy to use format including dozens of original images to help visualize fracture patterns and radiologic findings. \n\nOriginally developed by orthopedic surgeons for orthopedic surgeons, practitioners of all levels and specialties who encounter adult skeletal trauma will find Ortho Traumapedia useful as a condensed reference and educational tool. Whether you’re a primary care or emergency physician, physician’s assistant, nurse practitioner, resident or medical student, Ortho Traumapedia provides highly pertinent information regarding skeletal trauma right at your fingertips. \n\nOrtho Traumapedia is organized into chapters by bone (for fractures) and joint (for dislocations). Each chapter is divided into four sections: Facts, Imaging, Classification and Treatment: \n\nFacts begins with epidemiology and common injury mechanisms. This is followed by an outline of pertinent anatomy, eponyms and variants. Finally, patient presentation, examination and management tips are presented. \n\nImaging begins with the standard radiographic examinations for each anatomic region. This is followed by injury-specific views, relevant metrics and findings as well as supplemental modalities. \n\nClassification outlines the most common classification systems used to describe the selected injury. \n\nTreatment begins with general treatment principles and reviews treatment in the acute setting. This is followed by standard of care options grouped by injury pattern. Common complications associated with the injury are included at the end of this section. \n\nSimply select the bone or joint you’re interested in from the main menu and navigate between the four sections with the buttons on the bottom of the screen. Return to the main menu by pressing the left arrow in the title bar. There's never been a simpler, more mobile skeletal trauma reference!"

Move this filter up and down the frequency range until it closely matches the ringing frequency in your ears. \n\nAdd a bandstop filter at these frequencies to any sound or mix to create your tinnitus mask.\n\nThe advanced filters can be applied to both ears or just one ear, and different frequency ranges can be used for each ear.\n\nYou can set a wide range of filter widths from 0.1 to 4.0 octaves, down to 1Hz resolution.\n\nAnd you can adjust the volume level in each ear with a single balance control.\n\nWith Tinnitus HQ you can create advanced natural-sounding tinnitus masks to help relieve your tinnitus symptoms. \n\nTinnitus HQ features:\n\n• Over 500 high-quality natural sound recordings\n• Precision bandpass and bandstop filters to identify and mask ringing frequencies\n• Wide frequency range: 128 Hz to 16 kHz\n• Filter widths from 0.1 to 4.0 Octaves, settable to 1Hz resolution\n• Two-ear and single-ear filtering capability\n• Independent Left-Right ear filter frequencies and widths\n• Left-Right ear volume balance control\n• Easy-to-create blended mixes of any 4 sounds\n• Runs in background while using other apps or when the screen is locked\n• Timer with slow audio fade-out\n• Beautiful high-definition images from around the globe\n• Modern easy-to-use interface\n• 15 different natural sound categories, including Rain, Rivers & Streams, Ocean, Lakes, Wind, Water Fountains, Fire, Birds, Crickets & Insects, Cars, Trains, Public Places, Household, Industrial, Soundscapes.\n\nDownload Tinnitus HQ now.\n\n\n* See http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0138595, http://www.pnas.org/content/107/3/1207.full, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2918775/ for descriptions of notched sound therapy and its positive results.\n\n* Please talk with your doctor about ringing in the ears and any other symptoms.

      "label": "Make reviewing essential physical therapy academic content enjoyable! Physical Therapist Content Master is designed to assist physical therapists to possess full command of core academic content. Physical Therapist Content Master is an ideal tool for physical therapist students, recent physical therapy graduates, and licensed physical therapists.\n\nThe academic content is organized into unique system and non-system categories. \n\nMusculoskeletal System\nNeuromuscular System\nCardiopulmonary System\nOther Systems\nEquipment and Devices\nTherapeutic Modalities\nSafety and Protection\nProfessional Responsibilities\nResearch\n\nPhysical therapists can review selected content by scrolling through subcategories in each of the system and non-system areas. Our innovative design presents academic content in a user-friendly format that allows users to easily digest essential information. Users rate their competence in a variety of topics and create personalized Study Stacks. Study Stacks allow users to efficiently remediate identified academic deficiencies. Frequent review of essential academic content allows users to successfully convert the information to long-term memory. \n\nPhysical Therapist Content Master includes an assessment mode that consists of 750 multiple-choice questions. Each multiple-choice question has four unique options and an explanation supporting the correct answer. The multiple-choice questions are designed to assess a user’s mastery of the information presented in the content review mode. The number of questions in each category varies from a minimum of 25 to a maximum of 175. Our Content Tag feature allows users to quickly review questions by topic area (i.e., special tests, cranial nerves, pulmonary function tests). \n\nA formal score report describes a physical therapist’s level of mastery cumulatively, by category, and by timeline. Each of the individual reports provides users with valuable performance data to assess their present level of academic mastery. Utilization of the app on a frequent basis considerably strengthens a physical therapist’s knowledge base and provides the necessary foundation to progress to higher level licensing-like questions. \n\nCompany Information\nScorebuilders is a physical therapist owned company whose sole focus is to prepare students for the National Physical Therapy Examinations. We sell more review products and offer more review courses than any other company. Scorebuilders has experienced three decades of continuous growth and is the recognized leader in physical therapy licensing preparation.

This app will test your ability to identify electrocardiogram rhythms. Recognition of ECG rhythms as the wave forms sweep across a monitor screen is a different skill than diagnosing cardiac rhythms on a static tracing. This app will evaluate your resuscitation skills better than reviewing with a book because you have to diagnose the rhythms as they dynamically move across the screen.\n\nThe app utilizes an organized four Criteria approach to identify the rhythms. You can also study the Description of the rhythm to review the electrophysiology. Use the same process to test yourself and review all the ECG rhythms.\n\nWhen you feel you have mastered the rhythms in this program you should review the American Heart Association Advanced Cardiac Life Support algorithms using the app Anesoft 'ACLS Sim 2016'."

      "label": "Bilateral Stimulation Therapy (BLST) is a neuropsychological treatment adapted from a treatment called EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing). EMDR is a gold standard treatment according to the World Health Organisation for the psychological treatment of trauma. Bilateral Stimulation is a key therapeutic tool used in EMDR. \n\nBilateral Stimulation simply means stimulation of both sides of the brain using eye movements, sound or tactile stimulation. Typically, it may involve moving your eyes from left to right whilst following a target or paying attention to sound in your left ear then to your right. Bilateral stimulation is referred to as a ‘bottom – up’ approach as it works on the emotion engine of the brain, the limbic system. This approach reduces emotional distress which allows the cortical areas of the brain (thinking, reasoning, planning) to become more active and effective. The effect of this approach is often experienced more quickly and easily.\n\nBecause this therapy uses one element of EMDR, it is called BLST so as to not confuse or give the user a wrong impression about the complete standard EMDR therapy. BLST uses one part of EMDR, and therefore 2can be practiced at home, work or any quiet environment where you can spend five minutes or so undisturbed much like meditation. For more information about BLST and EMDR please visit www.mromeopsych.com/blst\n\nThis minimal app uses bilateral click which, when activated, sounds alternately in each ear. The speed, tone and length of the practice can be set by the user. The App has two options: 1. BLST mode (bilateral stimulation with sound) and 2.

After gallons of coffee and many sleepless nights spent pouring over notes and textbooks, you still wonder if you’re going to make it.\n\nPreparing for a career in medicine requires learning a daunting amount of information and technique.

That’s where Physical Exam Essentials comes to the rescue. \n\nThis application lets you look up selected terms, view illustrations of physical exam maneuvers, read the Clinical Correlates to discover the significance of certain findings and find descriptions of special tests. Physical Exam Essentials even offers a guide for describing your findings.\n\nPhysical Exam Essentials is not a comprehensive medical reference. Rather, it is a handy overview resource that is perfect for medical students, pre-meds, health professionals and anyone who practices or has an interest in medicine. Conveniently located on your iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad, this application provides quick, easy-to-use reviews of procedures and techniques for 14 different categories:\n\n* The Health History\n * The General Survey \n* Skin and Nails \n* HEENT and Neck \n* Thorax and Lungs\n * Breast and Axillae\n * Cardiovascular Exam \n* Peripheral Vascular System\n * Abdominal Exam \n* Male G*******a, Anus, Rectum, Prostate\n * Female G*******a, Anus, Rectum\n * Mental Status Exam \n* Cranial Nerves\n * Neurological Exam \n\nAs you can see, Physical Exam Essentials has got you covered for examining your patients. That’s not all, though. Just look at some of the other features you get!\n\n* Attractive, easy to navigate interface\n* Look up certain selected terms in Wikipedia, Google, or Google images\n * Pictures in each section help to illustrate physical exam maneuvers\n * Includes \"Clinical Correlates\" which highlight the significance of certain physical exam findings\n * \"Presentation Tips\" included to help you describe your findings \n* Includes descriptions of special tests that are not usually performed in a routine physical exam\n * Content and images added and updated regularly \n\nForget carrying those heavy textbooks everywhere you go. Sometimes, all you need is your iDevice and Physical Exam Essentials.\n\nDownload this amazingly helpful application now. You and your patients will be glad that you did."

Physical Therapist Assistant Content Master is designed to assist physical therapist assistants to possess full command of core academic content. Physical Therapist Assistant Content Master is an ideal tool for physical therapist assistant students, recent physical therapist assistant graduates, and licensed physical therapist assistants.\n\nThe academic content is organized into unique system and non-system categories. \n\nMusculoskeletal System\nNeuromuscular System\nCardiopulmonary System\nOther Systems\nEquipment and Devices\nTherapeutic Modalities\nSafety and Protection\nProfessional Responsibilities\nResearch\n\nPhysical therapist assistants can review selected content by scrolling through subcategories in each of the system and non-system areas. Our innovative design presents academic content in a user-friendly format that allows users to easily digest essential information. Users rate their competence in a variety of topics and create personalized Study Stacks. Study Stacks allow users to efficiently remediate identified academic deficiencies. Frequent review of essential academic content allows users to successfully convert the information to long-term memory. \n\nPhysical Therapist Assistant Content Master includes an assessment mode that consists of 600 multiple-choice questions. Each multiple-choice question has four unique options and an explanation supporting the correct answer. The multiple-choice questions are designed to assess a user’s mastery of the information presented in the content review mode. The number of questions in each category varies from a minimum of 25 to a maximum of 125. Our Content Tag feature allows users to quickly review questions by topic area (i.e., special tests, cranial nerves, pulmonary function tests). \n\nA formal score report describes a physical therapist assistant’s level of mastery cumulatively, by category, and by timeline. Each of the individual reports provides users with valuable performance data to assess their present level of academic mastery. Utilization of the app on a frequent basis considerably strengthens a physical therapist assistant’s knowledge base and provides the necessary foundation to progress to higher level licensing-like questions. \n\nCompany Information\nScorebuilders is a physical therapist owned company whose sole focus is to prepare students for the National Physical Therapy Examinations. We sell more review products and offer more review courses than any other company. Scorebuilders has experienced three decades of continuous growth and is the recognized leader in physical therapy licensing preparation. Scorebuilders offers candidates the knowledge and insight necessary to achieve their goal of becoming a licensed physical therapist assistant on the first attempt.\n\nCopyright © 2019 Scorebuilders\n\nPhysical Therapist Assistant Content Master is the exclusive property of Scorebuilders.

      "label": "\"Love This App!\" \"Very Useful!\" \"Perfect!\" \"So Easy to Use!\" \"Great for my patients!\"\nSee why thousands of users around the world are raving about this app!\n\nPeople with memory impairments can become worried when they don't remember where they are or other important information. They may be unsafe when they forget to use a walker or apply the wheelchair breaks before standing. All of these facts and procedures can be engrained into memory using a repetitive and effective memory training procedure.\n\nThis Spaced Retrieval Therapy app uses the scientifically-proven method of spaced retrieval training to help people with dementia or other memory impairments to recall important information. Recalling an answer over multiplying intervals of time, such as 1 minute, 2 minutes, 8 minutes, and so on, helps to cement the information in memory.\n\nSpaced Retrieval Therapy is an enhanced interval timer with independent data tracking and prompts. It automatically increases the time between prompts with correct responses and decreases it with incorrect ones. This app will help clinicians, family members, and students keep track of the intervals and performance as they practice up to 3 memory targets.\n\n*Put away your stopwatch and paper - this app is all you need!\n\n*Keeps track of expanding intervals and data so you don't have to\n\n*Works in the background while doing other therapy exercises or using other apps\n\n*Subtle sound and visual prompts let you know it’s time to ask again\n\n*Tracks accuracy and data automatically, & emails you the finished report\n\n\n\"5 Stars - This app is a fantastic inclusion into my therapy toolbox. It is very useful in therapy and helps me keep track patient progress more efficiently.\" - App Store Review\n\n\nSpeech-Language Pathologists, Occupational Therapists, Neuropsychologists, Teachers, Social Workers, and families can all use this simple technique & app to help clients and loved ones remember important information (names, safety procedures, orientation information, etc).\n\nRecommended by top experts in memory training and dementia therapy, Spaced Retrieval Therapy will make your life easier and your therapy more efficient.\n\n\n\"***** Very Useful!  I found this app to be extremely useful during therapy sessions. When juggling multiple activities it can be difficult to remember to cue a patient for each specific interval. This app makes spaced retrieval an easy way to incorporate prospective and short term memory tasks into treatment.\" - SLP on App Store Review\n\n\nVisit our website at http://tactustherapy.com/app/srt/ to link to several articles about this technique and its proven efficacy with dementia, aphasia, normal learners, and more. \n\n\nThis app is also available as part of the Tactus Complete Therapy Toolkit and Tactus Cognitive Therapy Toolkit discount bundles for iPad users.\n\n\nPlease note: This app is a timer and tracks data.  Targets should be individually selected for the memory-impaired person to be relevant and meaningful.  This app is not intended to be used alone by the memory-impaired person, but as a therapy tool by a clinician or family member trained in this technique."

Easily saves 10+ minutes per patient -- seriously, an RD's best friend.\n\nBased on daily routines across all types of patients, we jammed EVERYTHING we need into just 3 simple screens. We've thoroughly tested the app in our own daily routines over the past year, and can't imagine not having this app anymore.\n\nWe've double-checked calculations many times and automated everything including tube feeding formulas where possible, so you don't have to. \n\n\nScreen 1: Quick Nutrition Needs --\nQuickly determine BMI, IBW, kcal needs (both MSJ and Penn State, for on or off ventilation), and protein needs. Easily account for stress factor and protein multipliers.\n\nScreen 2: Instant Tube Feeds --\nDetermine total volume, kcal, gm protein, %kcal protein, gm CHO, %kcal CHO, and mL free H2O in literally seconds. \n\nScreen 3: Parental Nutrition (TPN) calculator --\nInput rate and duration, and either grams or percentage dextrose/amino acids/lipids to determine total volume, kcal, gm protein, gm CHO, GIR, and gm fat/kg. Works for both 2-in-1 and 3-in-1 methods.\n\n\nWe made this app to fulfill our own biggest painpoints, but after realizing how indispensable it's become to us, we hope it's helpful for others now too. \n\nFeedback from clinical RDs is welcome!

      "label": "This App was designed specifically to help those in the medical field as well as individuals who deal with wounds on a daily basis. It is meant to replace the need for using unsanitary paper rulers and other unsanitary means of measuring the width, height, and depth of a wound on a patient or yourself. This saves you not only the cost of a separate measuring device each time a wound is measured, but also helps to reduce the chance of infection that can come from touching a measurement device to an open wound. \n\nWith the Wound Measurement App, you can measure a wound opening one-handed, reducing some of the problems that can come with measuring a wound in a difficult spot. Once the measurements are complete, a label with appear above the wound with the measurements and you can save a picture of both the measurements and the opening all at the same time, saving you time and effort. \n\nUsers now have the ability to add patient information to the label including Patient ID, Patient Name, and Wound Location. The date and time appear on the label automatically to help you keep track of when a measurement was taken.\n\nWe respect the privacy of our users and their patients. We cannot and will not access the camera or photos remotely. Please note that the app will need to be allowed to use your phone’s camera only to take the measurements, and it will need to be allowed to save a photo to the photos library. If you do not wish to keep a photo, you can always go to your photos library and delete anything you don't want to keep. We also don’t collect or ask for any information from the user, we feel that your apps and information belong to you, and that you should have complete control of your privacy.\n\nLike most people, we don’t like having to see adds all over the place, so we don’t use any adds in this app. \n\nFeatures List:\n-Simple to use, with easy access to instructions.\n-Easy, one-handed operation.\n-Augmented Reality, tested for accuracy.\n-Does not require internet or cellular connection to take measurements or save photos.\n-Sanitary - nothing touches the wound.\n-In poor lighting conditions, the flashlight can be turned on from within the App.\n-Allows you to track the healing process easily and visually through photos saved from the App.\n-Users can add information to the wound label (Patient ID, Patient Name, Wound Location).\n-Date and time now automatically appear on the wound label to help you keep track of the healing progress.\n-Light or Dark mode\n\nCompatible with iOS devices from iPhone 7 and up.\n\nFor the best results in Augmented Reality, keep the phone perpendicular to the surface you want to measure."

Carried in the pockets, phones and emergency vehicles of millions of first responders, this is the guide EMS Magazine calls “the original and still the best.”\n\nThe EMS Field Guide app puts critical information at your fingertips with rich content, detailed illustrations and pioneering features. This app is available in two editions— Advanced Life Support (ALS) and Basic & Intermediate Life Support (BLS)—designed specifically to correspond with each tier of EMT certification and practice, so you know you have the right tool for your job.\n\nThe Advanced Life Support (ALS) app equips the Paramedic or EMT-P to triage and address trauma. It provides fast, easy access to vital assessment information, medications, and drug doses; quick interpretation of 12-Lead EKGs; and the latest CPR and ACLS algorithms from the American Heart Association (AHA). The ALS app is also suitable for Intermediates whose practice orders require a more detailed understanding of these topics. \n\nREVIEWS\n\n“The EMS Field Guide by Informed is probably the most popular pocket reference guide carried on ambulances across the country.”\n\n“I love your guides. I’ve been a paramedic for 25 years and your ALS guides are the best source of reliable on-scene information.”\n\n“This is a great review tool as well as a resource.”\n\n“…Highly recommended in some of my advanced cardiac life support training courses.”\n\n“One of the best things a paramedic can have. A cheat sheet for the things you may not always remember.”\n\nFOR MORE INFORMATION\n\nInformed Publishing offers a full product line of references for the medical and first response markets, as well as a consumer line for home and family emergency preparedness. Informed references are available in a variety of formats: pocket-size print guides, and now, apps for the iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad.

      "label": "The VBAC Calculator is a convenient tool for predicting  the success rate of a vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC). The app consists of 3 calculators which use patient-specific data in order to generate a predictive score.\n\nThe \"Standard\" calculator uses the widely-used predictive model published in Grobman, William A., et al., “Development of a nomogram for prediction of vaginal birth after cesarean delivery,” Obstetrics & Gynecology, volume 109(4), pp. 806-812, 2007. This predictive model uses pre-pregnancy BMI and prior medical history to predict VBAC success rates. It can be used at any time during the term of pregnancy during a clinical visit.\n\nThe \"Standard + Admission Factors\" calculator is a variant of the 2007 Grobman prediction method as found in the following publication: Grobman William A., et al., “Does information available at the time of admission for delivery improve prediction of successful birth after cesarean?” American Journal of Perinatology, volume 26(10), pp.693-701, 2009. This model uses additional information at time of hospital admission to predict VBAC success rates.\n\nLastly, the \"Simple\" calculator also uses information at time of admission (same as the \"Standard + Admissions Factors\" calculator). The source for this predictive calculator is: Metz, Tori D., et al., “Simple, validated vaginal birth after cesarean delivery prediction model for use at the time of admission,” Obstetrics & Gynecology, volume 122(3), pp.571-578, 2013. This is a straight-forward prediction method that combines BMI and age information with the well-known Bishop Score calculation to determine VBAC success.\n\nPlease note that is app is provided solely for educational purposes and should not be used in lieu of sound, professional medical guidance."

The graphs display lows, highs, averages, and trend lines using statistical analysis.\n\nWhy iBP vs. other blood pressure apps?\n\niBP is a universal app designed to work on the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad, which means you only pay for the app once and you get all versions! iBP is the only blood pressure app with a built in transfer capability to sync all your iOS devices.\n\nWhat are the key features?\n\n* Reads and writes Apple Health blood pressure, pulse, and weight data (details below)\n* Easy data input using dials instead of keyboard\n* Transfer capability to sync all of your iOS devices\n* Calculates Mean Arterial Pressure and Pulse Pressure\n* Track one personal item (blood glucose, stress level, medication dosage, exercise time)\n* Backup / Restore capability\n* Multiple users\n* Multiple email addresses (you and doctor)\n* Multiple email formats (PDF, HTML, CSV, Plain Text)\n* Passcode to protect your data\n* Touch Id for passcode on devices that support it\n* Snapshot of the graphs can be saved\n* User configurable color ranges\n* Weight units (lb or kg)\n* Withings Blood Pressure Monitor & Wireless Scale\n\nApple Health\niBP is now able to read and write Apple Health blood pressure, pulse, and weight data. If your blood pressure monitor (i.e., Omron, iHealth, Withings) adds data to Apple Health then you can easily import that data into this app. If you manually input your data into this app, then it will write that data to Apple Health.\n\nWithings + iBP = No more data entry!\niBP can retrieve your blood pressure and weight data directly from your Withings account.  The Blood Pressure Monitor and wireless Body Scale automatically record and send the data to your account.  There is no data entry required and you can view the data anywhere using a web browser or a variety of mobile apps.\n\n\nDisclaimer: iBP is intended to be used as a means to collect data to be shared with your doctor. This application is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. We assume no liability for any personal harm or injury sustained as a result of using this application."

      "label": "SRR Counter for Dogs and Cats\n\nCount your pet’s heart rate while they are sleeping. It is a must have if your dog or cat has a heart condition and your vet recommends you track their heart rate on a regular basis.\n\nEASY TO USE\n\nWith the SRR Counter for Dogs and Cats app, you can easily count your pet’s breathing rate for 15 seconds, 30 seconds or 60 seconds. When your pet exhales, tap the Breath button to start the timer. Continue to tap the Breath button each time your pet exhales. Once complete, the number of breaths will display.\n\nCALCULATIONS\n– If you select 15 Seconds, the app will calculate each time you tap times 4.\n\n– If you select 30 Seconds, the app will calculate each time you tap times 2.\n\n– If you select 60 Seconds, the app will display the number of times you tap.\n\nFEATURES\n– The Apple Watch will provide haptic feedback with each tap. This allows you to watch your pet breathing, rather than your watch.\n\n– You will receive a haptic notification when the timer is finished and be presented with the total breath count.\n\n– No audible feedback so you won’t disturb your precious pet at rest! Please set the Apple Watch to silent to fully utilize this feature.\n\nMY STORY\n\nI created this app when my rescue dog, Bizou, went into heart failure at age 13 and was diagnosed with a grade 5 heart murmur. She was on several medications and my vet recommended I begin tracking her breathing to help them in regulating the dosages of her medications. I found it difficult for just 1 person to watch her breathing while also watching a timer to know when to stop counting. My goal was to make this much easier.\n\nDISCLAIMER\n\nContact your veterinarian for normal and elevated heart rates for both cats and dogs. If your pet has an elevated heart rate or you have any concerns about his or her health, please immediately contact your vet.\n\nFEEDBACK\n\nPlease send your feedback to support@verkadesg.com. I would love to implement new features based on your ideas!\n\nSee more information at www.verkadesg.com\n\nAll proceeds go to the Humane Society of York County http://humanesocietyofyorkcounty.org"

      "label": "Squeezy has helped thousands of women regain confidence in their pelvic floor. Pelvic health specialists around the world recommend Squeezy to their patients every day because it works.\n\nAround 30,000 people use Squeezy regularly to help them remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises. So if you are thinking about downloading Squeezy for your pelvic floor, you are not alone. \n\nAll women should be doing these exercises and some will be doing them as part of a physiotherapy programme.\n\nSqueezy is simple to use, informative and designed to help women to remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises (also known as Kegel exercises). \n\nFeatures includes:\n• A pre-set exercise plan that follows public health guidelines\n• A record of the number of exercises you have completed, compared to your target\n• Visual and audio guides for exercises\n• Exercise reminders with customisable settings\n• Educational information about the pelvic floor\n• “Professional mode” – if working with a pelvic health specialist, you can tailor the exercise plan to fit your needs\n• A bladder diary to keep track of your symptoms, if required\n• Simple and clear interface\n\nSqueezy has been clinically reviewed and approved by the NHS for its clinical safety, and is compliant with NHS Information Governance requirements.\n\nSqueezy won several industry awards including ehi Awards 2016, Health Innovation Network 2016, National Continence Care Awards 2015/16 and was a finalist for awards including Advancing Healthcare Awards 2014 and 2017, Abbvie Sustainable Healthcare Awards 2016.\n\nFor more about Squeezy and additional pelvic health information visit squeezyapp.com.\n\n*Apple Watch users*\nDuring your exercises you need to hold your finger on your Apple Watch face to keep it live and running. The play button changes to state ‘Hold’ when running an exercise.\n\nThis keeps your Watch from dozing off while your attention is focused on your pelvic floor. Most Watch screens go to sleep after 7 or 15 seconds (time dependent on your Watch settings). Squeezy has no control over the screen sleep time on the Watch; it has to obey your Watch settings. \n\nWe hope to be able to improve the Watch experience in future. In the meantime, we’re continuing the existing Watch support because many people find it helpful.\n\nIf you have feedback on the Apple Watch, please get in touch with the developers directly on help@squeezyapp.com.\n\n\nThis app has been translated into Saudi Arabian Arabic.\nتمت ترجمه هذا التطبيق الى اللغه العربيه ( المملكه العربيه السعوديه)‏"

Questions in each section will provide a no-nonsense audio rationale by Bill Brown. Use these sections to determine your readiness--and to help focus your study.\n\nWhen you are ready to try a simulated exam we have two, 135-question practice NRAEMT exams to test your overall knowledge and prepare you to take the NRAEMT. Our AEMT PASS Predictive Scoring process can predict if you will pass (or not), based on how well you do on the practice exams.\n\nUnique to the PASS apps is the chance to hear Bill. Throughout the AEMT PASS app, he'll give you tips and tricks for studying for the NREMT and describe what you can expect on the actual test."

The app is highly customizable and useful in all medical specialties.\n\nEntries are securely kept in your iOS device and are not sent to any outside server, website or database. Reports are created and saved as a password protected PDF file (encrypted using AES-128) and a CSV (comma-separated values) file that is compressed to a ZIP file (which allows password protection and is encrypted using AES-256) to comply with HIPAA security requirements. The reports can then be emailed, accessed via iTunes and the Files app, sent using AirDrop, or copied to your iCloud Drive or DropBox. CSV files can be imported into a spreadsheet program.\n\nOne should not rely on this app alone to keep track of their procedures and is advised to frequently backup the files created. Information on backing up and restoring your data is included in the app's Help/Instructions view.\n\nFEATURES\n• Keep a log of the procedures you have performed, assisted in, were 2nd assist in, observed, supervised, and/or interpreted for documentation purposes.\n• Document the patient's name, ID number, age, date performed, location, supervisor, diagnosis, complications and additional notes with the procedures performed. Also, one can take a photo with your device's camera or import a photo from your photos library from within the app, and include the photo in a record.\n• Option to select one or multiple diagnoses from a list of either custom diagnoses or ICD-10 diagnoses for any given procedure.\n• Select multiple procedures performed on a single patient.\n• Sort by date (ascending or descending), patient name, procedure name, and medical specialty.\n• Capture supervisor's signature to attest that you performed or assisted in the pro­cedure(s) and include the signature ima­ges in your reports. Either obtain the supervisor's signature attestation at the time you create the log entry, or save the entry without the signature and obtain the signature attestation at a later time.\n• Detailed help/instructions section.\n\nCUSTOMIZABLE\n• List of procedures, favorite diagnoses, and complications are easily customizable (you can add procedures/diagnoses/complications to or delete them from the lists). (ICD-10 diagnoses cannot be edited or deleted.)\n• Locations and Supervisor's names are saved and can be selected from a picker so you don't have to type them in again when adding another log entry.\n• Add up to four custom fields in addition to the default fields listed above in Features.\n\nREPORTS\n• Create reports in password protected PDF format and as a CSV file that is password protected in a ZIP format, as well as a password protected backup of your data, that can then be emailed, sent via AirDrop, sent to your iCloud Drive or Dropbox account, or downloaded using iTunes when your iOS device is con­nected to your computer.\n• Reports can be created for a specific date range, and one can specify the primary, secondary and tertiary sort order of the PDF report.\n\nBACKUP\n• In addition to backing up to iCloud and/or iTunes, if you have a DropBox account, you can copy the password protected backup file and reports to DropBox from within the Procedure Log app. \n• You can also use the Files app to transfer files to your iCloud Drive, Dropbox account, or, if you have a Mac computer, use AirDrop to transfer it to your Mac computer.\n• You can also email the password protected backup file to yourself.\n\nSECURITY\n• App is password protected and all data is encrypted when you log off the app or the app is no longer the active app.\n• PDF and CSV reports are encrypted and password protected.\n• Retrieve your username and password if you have forgotten them; you must first answer several security questions in the \"Create User\" or the \"Edit User\" views."

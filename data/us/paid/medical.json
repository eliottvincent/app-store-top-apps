      "label": "Researchers at Monash University have developed the low FODMAP diet and a corresponding app to assist in the management of gastrointestinal symptoms associated with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The Monash University FODMAP diet works by swapping foods high in fermentable carbohydrates (FODMAPs), with low FODMAP alternatives. Around 75% of people with IBS experience symptom relief on a low FODMAP diet.\n\nThe app comes directly from the research team at Monash and includes the following:\n\n- General information about the FODMAP diet and IBS.\n- Easy to understand tutorials to guide you through the app and the 3-Step FODMAP diet.\n- A Food Guide detailing the FODMAP content for hundreds of foods using a simple 'traffic light system'. \n- A list of branded products that have been certified by Monash as low FODMAP.\n- A collection of over 70 nutritious, low FODMAP recipes.\n- Functions that allow you to create your own shopping list and add notes to individual foods\n- A Diary that enables you to record food eaten, IBS symptoms, bowel habits and stress levels. The Diary will also guide you through step 2 of the diet - FODMAP reintroduction.\n- The ability to adjust units of measurement (metric or imperial) and activate colour blindness assistance."

      "label": "Pregnant? This is for YOU!\nOur leading app allows you to use just your iPhone microphone to record and share your baby’s sounds. It is the best-in-class, has excellent reviews, is super simple and safe to use. Now supports Apple Airpods and Bluetooth Headphones.\n\n\"It took some time and patience... thank you for creating this cheap, awesome technology to use at home.\" - Niki\n\nCategory #1 in the USA and 102 other countries. Here's why...\n\nDeveloped by parents like you (with expertise in sound engineering and app development) who wanted a trustworthy, safe and easy-to-use way to record our baby's fetal sounds (kicks, heartbeat etc.) - and keep a record of a quality that we hadn't been able to find before in other apps. It has been extensively tested on expectant mothers.\n\n\"I was skeptical at first. Great app! Worth it.\" - Legretta \n\n**** But honestly, does it actually work?? ****\nYes. We've sound-engineered ways to attempt to isolate the baby's heart beat, sounds (kicks, heart beat and more) and using an advanced algorithm, amplify them making them easier to detect and hear.\n\nNOTE: It takes time, technique and patience and depends on the position and number of weeks of your baby so you'll need to stick with it. When you do, our results are excellent. Results are best between 27-40 weeks as your baby is bigger and stronger. \n\nWe constantly improve our extensive tutorial and techniques to handhold you through - we even have a support group on Facebook so you can get help.\n\nWe want you to be happy with Hear My Baby heartbeat and getting results can sometimes be difficult.  If you are struggling (can't find your own heartbeat etc. DO contact us via support. We want to help you!\n\nGIFT THIS APP: Click the “Buy App” arrow on the iTunes® App Store\n\n\nFAQs\n\n**** No Accessories Required ****\nWe use the internal microphone from your phone to attempt to listen and record your fetal sound. We recommend Bluetooth Headphones for best results.\n\n**** How It Works ****\n1. Hear My Baby, has been precisely engineered to listen to abdominal sounds, then record and amplify them. Listen to your own heartbeat first to confirm the app is set up correctly. \n2. It works best when baby is head down and their back is facing forwards.\n3. Remove the case, be in a very quiet room and focus on your lower abdomen. Listen then Tap record.\n4. Our simple recording management helps you to keep a record of your special moment\n5. Take a selfie if you wish and share \n6. We'll walk you through exactly how to get the best baby heartbeat results.\n\n**** Easy Share Feature ****\nSharing is awesome you can opt to share via Facebook, Whats App, Instagram or email.\n\n**** We Care About Your Privacy ****\nWe take your privacy and special moment seriously. You decide who sees or hears it and can delete it at any time.\n\n**** Before you start... ****\nYou DO need to carefully follow the instructions for Hear My Baby to work. A quiet room is critical for results as the mic is super sensitive.   HMB doesn't fake the baby heartbeat or other fetal sounds :) \n\nPlease Note: results are normally superb, however the recording may not work if your placenta is at the front of the tummy or the baby is in the wrong position.\n\n**** Supported Phones ****\n13,12, X, Xs, 11, 11 Pro, 8, 7, 7+, SE, 6s, 6s+, 6, 6+ 5c, 5s & 5. We don't support iPad.\n\n**** Worried about safety? We are too! ***\nHMB is safe but to be extra sure DO switch your iPhone to airplane mode. This is a precaution and automatically stops all cellular transmissions.\n\n**** Is it a substitute for medical devices/support? ****\nNo - under no circumstances is HMB a substitute for medical support - if you don't get a result it doesn't mean anything is wrong :) Consult your doctor for any advice. We are NOT approved by the FDA. This is not a medical device and is not a medical baby heartbeat monitor. It is for FUN.\n\nPlease do check our T&Cs before downloading.\n\nFor results examples: www.facebook.com/hearmybaby\nwww.instagram.com/hearmybabyapp"

The guidelines articles, as published in the Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease, as well as the comprehensive risk estimates, can be accessed through https://www.asccp.org/guidelines.  \n\nThese evidence-based management guidelines, initially developed in 2019, came together through a consensus process of 19 organizations. The updated management guidelines aim to:\n • Allow for a more complete and precise estimation of risk\n • Provide more appropriate intervention for high-risk individuals (detect and treat more precancer)\n • Recommend less intervention for low-risk individuals (decrease testing and treatment that won’t prevent cancer and may cause reproductive harm)\n • Allow for the future addition of new risk modifiers and screening and management technologies\n\nSee https://www.asccp.org/UserGuide for tips on using the app."

She will help you relax between surges with a mix of guided relaxations, positive affirmations, gentle music and calming visualisations. Freya makes it easy for you to keep track of your surges and you can visit the log at any point to see how frequently your surges are coming and how long they are lasting. Freya will also let you know when your labour is established and when it might be a good time to contact your midwife. You will never birth alone with Freya by your side.\n \nTRACK YOUR SURGES\n\nIn hypnobirthing we refer to contractions as surges, as a ‘surge’ more accurately describes the sensation you’ll experience when in labour. Freya is the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the app store, designed specifically with hypnobirthing mums in mind, but can be used by anyone.\n \nPREPARE FOR BIRTH\n\nYou can also use Freya in pregnancy to help you relax and prepare for your birth. In fact the more you listen to the guided relaxations and positive affirmations, the more familiar they will become and the more effective they will be at helping you relax when it comes to birth. Positive affirmations have been proven to change the way your mind works and listening regularly will help you feel less anxious and more confident in the lead up to birth. \n \nTHE SCIENCE\n\nWe know the more relaxed you are during birth, the more oxytocin you will produce. Oxytocin helps your uterus to work efficiently, making labour faster and more comfortable. \n \nLIFESKILLS\n\nYou can also use Freya post-birth any time you feel you could benefit from taking some deep breaths or need some help finding your zen. Everything you learn through using Freya - mindfulness exercises, breathing techniques, the benefits of taking time out - are skills for life.\n\nIf you have any questions or spot any pesky bugs lurking about the place (!) please do let us know at help@thepositivebirthcompany.co.uk\n\nWHAT YOU’LL GET:\n\niPhone and Apple Watch app\nA timer to record your surges (also known as a contraction timer)\nCoaching audio to keep your mind focused on breathing through each surge\nA gentle expanding visualisation which you can use to sync your breathing\nA detailed log of your surges over time, so you can track your progress through labour\nAbility to easily share the log with your birth partner, midwife or doula\nGuided relaxations, positive affirmations and soothing visuals to help keep you calm and relaxed, making birth easier, quicker and more straightforward (can also be used in pregnancy and postnatally)\nCoaching created by renowned hypnobirthing expert Siobhan Miller, founder of The Positive Birth Company\n\nDownload the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the App Store and prepare to meet your baby in the best possible way, feeling calm and confident, relaxed and happy!"

Using this app is the equivalent to spending hours with the world’s most experienced doctors teaching you about your calcium, parathyroid, osteoporosis, and vitamin D issues. Your tests results are analyzed to determine if a problem exists, what risks are associated, and what to do about it. Beautiful graphs make understanding these problems simple!\n\nBlood tests and bone density scans can be difficult to interpret—even many doctors do not diagnose calcium, vitamin D, and parathyroid problems correctly or timely. Hyperparathyroidism is a disease that affects 1 in 800 people and 1 in 250 women over 50 and is very often overlooked while patients suffer from chronic fatigue, memory loss, depression, osteoporosis, bone pain and many other symptoms. Calcium Pro is a powerful software program that will analyze your calcium health and provide you guidance about the status of your bones, kidneys, parathyroid glands, vitamin D, and other related health issues.\n\nYou start by entering your test results for calcium, parathyroid hormone, and vitamin D. Then we look at your bone density (osteoporosis levels). CalciumPro will analyze and graph your tests making them easy to understand. It will let you know the status of your parathyroid glands and your chance of having hyperparathyroidism. Suggested next steps are given. Tracking tools will show your calcium and vitamin D levels over time, and will show if your bones are losing density (worsening osteoporosis), or gaining bone density. There are important learning tools on every page, and an extensive video and reading library at the end. The app will provide guidance about talking to your physician regarding the possible need for surgery and other important steps.\n\nA Risk Assessment Tool shows your relative risk for conditions associated with high blood calcium: Osteoporosis, Heart Disease, Heart Arrhythmias and Palpitations, High Blood Pressure, Kidney Stones and Kidney Failure, GERD, several Cancers, and others. Watch your risk assessment graphs change as you address your calcium problems. \n\nThis app was developed by doctors at the Norman Parathyroid Center, the world’s leading parathyroid and calcium treatment center using over 4,000,000 data points from over 30,000 patients. Let the world’s leading doctors help you understand these problems so you and your doctor can make important, informed decisions. Take control of your own health!"

      "label": "Make reviewing essential physical therapy academic content enjoyable! Physical Therapist Content Master is designed to assist physical therapists to possess full command of core academic content. Physical Therapist Content Master is an ideal tool for physical therapist students, recent physical therapy graduates, and licensed physical therapists.\n\nThe academic content is organized into unique system and non-system categories. \n\nMusculoskeletal System\nNeuromuscular System\nCardiopulmonary System\nOther Systems\nEquipment and Devices\nTherapeutic Modalities\nSafety and Protection\nProfessional Responsibilities\nResearch\n\nPhysical therapists can review selected content by scrolling through subcategories in each of the system and non-system areas. Our innovative design presents academic content in a user-friendly format that allows users to easily digest essential information. Users rate their competence in a variety of topics and create personalized Study Stacks. Study Stacks allow users to efficiently remediate identified academic deficiencies. Frequent review of essential academic content allows users to successfully convert the information to long-term memory. \n\nPhysical Therapist Content Master includes an assessment mode that consists of 750 multiple-choice questions. Each multiple-choice question has four unique options and an explanation supporting the correct answer. The multiple-choice questions are designed to assess a user’s mastery of the information presented in the content review mode. The number of questions in each category varies from a minimum of 25 to a maximum of 175. Our Content Tag feature allows users to quickly review questions by topic area (i.e., special tests, cranial nerves, pulmonary function tests). \n\nA formal score report describes a physical therapist’s level of mastery cumulatively, by category, and by timeline. Each of the individual reports provides users with valuable performance data to assess their present level of academic mastery. Utilization of the app on a frequent basis considerably strengthens a physical therapist’s knowledge base and provides the necessary foundation to progress to higher level licensing-like questions. \n\nCompany Information\nScorebuilders is a physical therapist owned company whose sole focus is to prepare students for the National Physical Therapy Examinations. We sell more review products and offer more review courses than any other company. Scorebuilders has experienced three decades of continuous growth and is the recognized leader in physical therapy licensing preparation. Scorebuilders offers candidates the knowledge and insight necessary to achieve their goal of becoming a licensed physical therapist on the first attempt.\n\nCopyright © 2019 Scorebuilders\n\nPhysical Therapist Content Master is the exclusive property of Scorebuilders.

      "label": "CARMA, the Cardiac Arrest Resuscitation Mobile Application, is an ACLS tool designed to help guide practitioners through bedside resuscitation.\n\nPreliminary trials using the algorithm presented in CARMA has resulted in an 80% increase in patient survival of a CPR event. \n\nCARMA has four independent countdown timers, swipe-able Ventricular Tachycardia & Ventricular Fibrillation and Pulseless Electrical Activity (PEA) reference pages. There is  a complete list of select-able Diagnostic Tips (H's and T's) and recommended medication and non-medication treatment solutions. CARMA is an invaluable, portable tool for healthcare professionals in the resuscitation of patients experiencing cardiopulmonary arrest.\n \nCARMA includes an audible CPR metronome which defaults to 100 beats/minute, and timers for Epinephrine, Amniodarone and code duration. The duration timer prompts the leader to reevaluate every 30 minutes. Each timer has a unique vibrate feature when it completes its  cycle. All of CARMA's timer durations, rates and audible features are configurable through CARMA's preferences menu.\n\nCARMA also features a logging process that automatically tracks all activities within a session.  They include timer starts and stops, H's and T's selections, rhythm, medication and non-drug intervention selections.  Each event is time stamped for easy review.  In addition, the session log can be easily emailed for archiving purposes.  In conformance with HIPAA requirements, no patient information is stored in the log and the log does not reside in the physical space of the mobile device.  Once the application exits or is reset, the log is deleted.\n \nCARMA is an  ACLS tool which gives healthcare providers the ability to better manage cardio-pulmonary events. It guides the provider through ACLS protocols in real time at the bedside utilizing the 2014 American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines, leading to better outcomes.\n \n\nFor more information visit\nwww.carmaforlife.com"

      "label": "This app is intended for obstetricians, midwives, and nurses who use electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) in laboring patients.   In addition to interpreting fetal heart rate (FHR) tracings, health care professionals must communicate with each other about the tracings in a way that is understood by all parties, and decide what action to take.\n\nFHR 5-tier is based on the five-color system developed by Drs. Julian Parer and Tomoaki Ikeda.  (AJOG July 2007) The intent of their system is to standardize management of different fetal heart rate tracings. The system divides all fetal heart rate tracings into one of five categories:  Green (no acidemia, no intervention required), Blue, Yellow, Orange or Red (evidence of actual or impending fetal asphyxia, rapid delivery recommended).   Each color has assigned to it a:  a) risk of acidemia, b) risk of evolution to a more serious pattern and c) recommended action.\n\nThe NICHD three-tier system of classifying fetal heart rate (FHR) tracings has been criticized for having too wide a range of tracings in “Category II”. Some researchers and clinicians believe that the five-tier color-coded system more effectively classifies EFM tracings.  The five-tier system is being adopted by an increasing number of hospitals in the U.S. and in Japan.\n\nFHR 5-tier makes it easier to use the five-color system.\n\nWithout the FHR 5-tier app, one must refer to a table with 134 possible combinations of variability, baseline, and decelerations.  One must also either memorize or refer to the definitions for mild, moderate and severe decelerations, which are complex and sometimes confusing.\n\nWhen using the FHR 5-tier app it is not necessary to refer to any other table or chart. Variability and baseline, and the shape, nadir, and duration of decelerations are entered with buttons on the consecutive screens. The app calculates the severity of the deceleration and the color for each tracing.  All aspects of the tracing are summarized on the colored results screen, so that the user can quickly communicate with others.\n\nManagement recommendations as outlined by Parer and Ikeda are given. These include whether or not the obstetrician needs to be at the bedside; what other personnel should be available; and whether the patient should be moved to the operating room.  In addition, conservative management techniques are listed where appropriate.  Thus, for Blue, Yellow, and Orange tracings, the final results screen reminds the user to consider actions such as maternal position change, decreasing oxytocin, or amnioinfusion.  \n\nAs noted by Parer and Ikeda, the guidelines for management may need to be modified for institutions other then theirs, and may even change depending on time of day.\n\nThe NICHD Category (I, II, III) is also given on the results screen.\n\n This application is intended as a reference tool for use only by licensed healthcare professionals.  This application is not a substitute for each licensed healthcare professional's independent clinical judgment.  No medical decision should be based solely on information obtained by use of this tool.  \n\n\nThis application tries to faithfully aggregate information from major authorities (see references) and does not introduce or substitute the judgment of the makers of this application for those authorities.

      "label": "Make reviewing essential physical therapy academic content enjoyable! Physical Therapist Assistant Content Master is designed to assist physical therapist assistants to possess full command of core academic content. Physical Therapist Assistant Content Master is an ideal tool for physical therapist assistant students, recent physical therapist assistant graduates, and licensed physical therapist assistants.\n\nThe academic content is organized into unique system and non-system categories. \n\nMusculoskeletal System\nNeuromuscular System\nCardiopulmonary System\nOther Systems\nEquipment and Devices\nTherapeutic Modalities\nSafety and Protection\nProfessional Responsibilities\nResearch\n\nPhysical therapist assistants can review selected content by scrolling through subcategories in each of the system and non-system areas. Our innovative design presents academic content in a user-friendly format that allows users to easily digest essential information. Users rate their competence in a variety of topics and create personalized Study Stacks. Study Stacks allow users to efficiently remediate identified academic deficiencies. Frequent review of essential academic content allows users to successfully convert the information to long-term memory. \n\nPhysical Therapist Assistant Content Master includes an assessment mode that consists of 600 multiple-choice questions. Each multiple-choice question has four unique options and an explanation supporting the correct answer. The multiple-choice questions are designed to assess a user’s mastery of the information presented in the content review mode. The number of questions in each category varies from a minimum of 25 to a maximum of 125. Our Content Tag feature allows users to quickly review questions by topic area (i.e., special tests, cranial nerves, pulmonary function tests). \n\nA formal score report describes a physical therapist assistant’s level of mastery cumulatively, by category, and by timeline. Each of the individual reports provides users with valuable performance data to assess their present level of academic mastery. Utilization of the app on a frequent basis considerably strengthens a physical therapist assistant’s knowledge base and provides the necessary foundation to progress to higher level licensing-like questions. \n\nCompany Information\nScorebuilders is a physical therapist owned company whose sole focus is to prepare students for the National Physical Therapy Examinations. We sell more review products and offer more review courses than any other company. Scorebuilders has experienced three decades of continuous growth and is the recognized leader in physical therapy licensing preparation. Scorebuilders offers candidates the knowledge and insight necessary to achieve their goal of becoming a licensed physical therapist assistant on the first attempt.\n\nCopyright © 2019 Scorebuilders\n\nPhysical Therapist Assistant Content Master is the exclusive property of Scorebuilders.

      "label": "Bilateral Stimulation Therapy (BLST) is a neuropsychological treatment adapted from a treatment called EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing). EMDR is a gold standard treatment according to the World Health Organisation for the psychological treatment of trauma. Bilateral Stimulation is a key therapeutic tool used in EMDR. \n\nBilateral Stimulation simply means stimulation of both sides of the brain using eye movements, sound or tactile stimulation. Typically, it may involve moving your eyes from left to right whilst following a target or paying attention to sound in your left ear then to your right. Bilateral stimulation is referred to as a ‘bottom – up’ approach as it works on the emotion engine of the brain, the limbic system. This approach reduces emotional distress which allows the cortical areas of the brain (thinking, reasoning, planning) to become more active and effective. The effect of this approach is often experienced more quickly and easily.\n\nBecause this therapy uses one element of EMDR, it is called BLST so as to not confuse or give the user a wrong impression about the complete standard EMDR therapy. BLST uses one part of EMDR, and therefore 2can be practiced at home, work or any quiet environment where you can spend five minutes or so undisturbed much like meditation. For more information about BLST and EMDR please visit www.mromeopsych.com/blst\n\nThis minimal app uses bilateral click which, when activated, sounds alternately in each ear. The speed, tone and length of the practice can be set by the user. The App has two options: 1. BLST mode (bilateral stimulation with sound) and 2. FLASH (an adaption of Dr Phillip Manfield’s FLASH technique. Please visit https://www.flashtechnique.com for more information).\n\nThis app is a clinical tool for psychologists, psychiatrists, EMDR therapists and their patients. While information is provided at www.mromeopsych.com/blst, you should consult your EMDR therapist before using it. Please note: Persons suffering with complex PTSD Dissociative Identity Disorder, Borderline Personality, Schizophrenia or unstable neurological conditions (eg; epilepsy) should not use this product without consultation with your therapist.\n\nAs we are frequently updating this app to improve it’s functionality and increase its features, we ask that any comments or suggestions that you have, please contact us at admin@mromeopsych.com. Thank you."

A separate device is required.\n\nWhat kind of analysis does iBP provide?\n\niBP uses color icons to indicate when your blood pressure values are normal, high, or hypertension. It also provides interactive graphs that allow you to display your values by weeks, months, year and time of day. The graphs display lows, highs, averages, and trend lines using statistical analysis.\n\nWhy iBP vs. other blood pressure apps?\n\niBP is a universal app designed to work on the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad, which means you only pay for the app once and you get all versions! iBP is the only blood pressure app with a built in transfer capability to sync all your iOS devices.\n\nWhat are the key features?\n\n* Reads and writes Apple Health blood pressure, pulse, and weight data (details below)\n* Easy data input using dials instead of keyboard\n* Transfer capability to sync all of your iOS devices\n* Calculates Mean Arterial Pressure and Pulse Pressure\n* Track one personal item (blood glucose, stress level, medication dosage, exercise time)\n* Backup / Restore capability\n* Multiple users\n* Multiple email addresses (you and doctor)\n* Multiple email formats (PDF, HTML, CSV, Plain Text)\n* Passcode to protect your data\n* Touch Id for passcode on devices that support it\n* Snapshot of the graphs can be saved\n* User configurable color ranges\n* Weight units (lb or kg)\n* Withings Blood Pressure Monitor & Wireless Scale\n\nApple Health\niBP is now able to read and write Apple Health blood pressure, pulse, and weight data. If your blood pressure monitor (i.e., Omron, iHealth, Withings) adds data to Apple Health then you can easily import that data into this app. If you manually input your data into this app, then it will write that data to Apple Health.\n\nWithings + iBP = No more data entry!\niBP can retrieve your blood pressure and weight data directly from your Withings account.  The Blood Pressure Monitor and wireless Body Scale automatically record and send the data to your account.  There is no data entry required and you can view the data anywhere using a web browser or a variety of mobile apps.\n\n\nDisclaimer: iBP is intended to be used as a means to collect data to be shared with your doctor.

Example images of abnormal findings are imbedded throughout and accessed with a simple touch.  The seasoned user will find it useful for the more challenging tracings and diagnostic conundrums that might be less frequently encountered.  After all abnormal findings are entered by touching the appropriate buttons, a list of potential differential diagnoses is generated.  Overdoses, electrolyte disorders, and arrhythmias are examples of the possible differentials that are generated.  No guarantee of accuracy is made and the user should always consider patient history and rely on sound clinical reasoning and training to make treatment decisions.  A basic EKG education and understanding is required.  No internet connection is needed.  Visit the website for more information.\n*Do not include PAC's or PVC's when inputting findings."

      "label": "****Thank you for making us a TOP 25 App in US, UK and Canada App Store category specific rankings!****\n\nSeasonal affective disorder, or SAD, is a kind of depression that appears at certain times of the year. Light therapy is one of the potential treatments for this condition. Almost 80% of the people who try light therapy find it beneficial. This app converts your apple device into a light box.\n\nWhy you SHOULD NOT download this App:\n1. If you are looking for a SAD Light Box App that generates an intensity of 10,000 Lux\n2. If you are looking for a quick fix and can not commit to consistent morning exposure sessions for at least 2 weeks\n3. If you will get turned off by the simplicity of this app and the solution to Seasonal Affective Disorder\n\nWhy you SHOULD download this App:\n1. If you want to try a cheap yet effective alternative to a traditional Light box which uses lower intensity BLUE LIGHT (approx. 100 to 575 Lux) and is backed by research (Google research paper: The effects of low-intensity narrow-band blue-light treatment compared to bright white-light treatment in sub-syndromal seasonal affective disorder by NCBI, US National Library of Medicine)\n2. If you would rather be intelligent and try something for a fiver rather than spend a few hundred dollars on a conventional light box\n3. If you are able to consistently commit to regular morning exposure sessions for at least 2 weeks \n4. If you would be happy with a REALLY SIMPLE APP that transforms your Apple device into a Light box and is more portable and user friendly\n5. If the weather is making you sad :( and you would rather be happy :)\n     \nThis app can also help you:\n1. Determine if you are suffering from Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD)/ Cabin Fever/ Winter Blues/ Seasonal Depression with help of a short scored test\n2. Create your own unique shade of Blue / White / any other color light that works best for you\n3. Use the app as a Dawn Simulator (set alarm)\n4. Set timer for your light box to time your morning exposure sessions\n5. Shop for other products to help with SAD\n6. Listen to the Radio in the background\n\nUV Rating: The UV emission from your Apple Device is 0, hence this app does not have a UV rating. \n\nSome other activities you might want to try to deal with symptoms of Seasonal Affective Disorder are:\n• End your morning shower with a cold shower\n• Try to arrange the spaces you spend time in to maximize sunlight exposure\n• Keep curtains open during the day\n• Trim tree branches or hedges that may be blocking some of the light from getting into your home\n• Move furniture so that you sit near a window or, if you exercise indoors, set up your exercise equipment by a window\n• Install skylights and add lamps\n• Build physical activity into your lifestyle preferably before SAD symptoms take hold. Physical activity relieves stress, builds energy and increases both your physical and mental well-being and resilience\n• Make a habit of taking a daily noon-hour walk, particularly if you commute to school or work in the dark hours of the day\n• Meditate at least 20 min a day (focus on your breathing)\n• Try High intensity training if you are fit enough and have less time\n• Maintain good sleep hygiene\n• When all else fails, try a winter vacation in sunny climates—if the pocket and work schedule allow. Keep in mind that the symptoms will recur after you return home\n\nREFUND POLICY: If you consistently use the App for 14 days and show us that you genuinely tried but did not get any results, WE WILL REFUND 100% OF YOUR MONEY. *Subject to terms and conditions of Apple Inc. and the Apple App Store.\n\nSmile, because somewhere far away, we are cheering for you :)\n\n*THIS APP MUST NOT BE USED TO SUBSTITUTE ANY MEDICATION/ MEDICAL DEVICE. THE CREATORS/ PUBLISHERS OF THIS APP WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGE RESULTING AS A USE OF THIS APP. PLEASE CONSULT YOUR DOCTOR BEFORE MAKING ANY CHANGES. NO PART OF THIS DESCRIPTION OR APP MUST BE CONSIDERED AS MEDICAL ADVICE*"

      "label": "Do you have tinnitus or “ringing in the ears”? Tinnitus HQ helps you understand and relieve your tinnitus symptoms.\n\nRecent research shows that tinnitus can be treated by listening to sounds that have been filtered to remove your specific tinnitus frequencies.*\n\nWith Tinnitus HQ, you can apply advanced filters to over 500 high-quality sounds to find relief for your symptoms.\n\nSimply apply a bandpass filter to any sound or mix to isolate frequencies in a narrow range. Move this filter up and down the frequency range until it closely matches the ringing frequency in your ears. \n\nAdd a bandstop filter at these frequencies to any sound or mix to create your tinnitus mask.\n\nThe advanced filters can be applied to both ears or just one ear, and different frequency ranges can be used for each ear.\n\nYou can set a wide range of filter widths from 0.1 to 4.0 octaves, down to 1Hz resolution.\n\nAnd you can adjust the volume level in each ear with a single balance control.\n\nWith Tinnitus HQ you can create advanced natural-sounding tinnitus masks to help relieve your tinnitus symptoms. \n\nTinnitus HQ features:\n\n• Over 500 high-quality natural sound recordings\n• Precision bandpass and bandstop filters to identify and mask ringing frequencies\n• Wide frequency range: 128 Hz to 16 kHz\n• Filter widths from 0.1 to 4.0 Octaves, settable to 1Hz resolution\n• Two-ear and single-ear filtering capability\n• Independent Left-Right ear filter frequencies and widths\n• Left-Right ear volume balance control\n• Easy-to-create blended mixes of any 4 sounds\n• Runs in background while using other apps or when the screen is locked\n• Timer with slow audio fade-out\n• Beautiful high-definition images from around the globe\n• Modern easy-to-use interface\n• 15 different natural sound categories, including Rain, Rivers & Streams, Ocean, Lakes, Wind, Water Fountains, Fire, Birds, Crickets & Insects, Cars, Trains, Public Places, Household, Industrial, Soundscapes.\n\nDownload Tinnitus HQ now.\n\n\n* See http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0138595, http://www.pnas.org/content/107/3/1207.full, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2918775/ for descriptions of notched sound therapy and its positive results.\n\n* Please talk with your doctor about ringing in the ears and any other symptoms.

      "label": "The Rotterdam Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator is based on ERSPC, Rotterdam, data and supported by the Prostate Cancer Research Foundation, Rotterdam (SWOP)\n \n \nThe Prostate Cancer Research Foundation, Rotterdam, Stichting Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek Prostaatkanker (SWOP), is an initiative of the Department of Urology of the Erasmus MC, the University and Medical Centre of Rotterdam, in The Netherlands. Its goal is the financial support of scientific research projects in the field of prostate cancer, as well as other cancers of the urinary tract.\nPlease be aware that the Rotterdam Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator for iOS cannot be 100% accurate at predicting the presence or absence of prostate cancer. It is designed to help calculate your risk, not give a definitive diagnosis.\nThe Rotterdam Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator for iOS provides a general risk calculation based on your PSA level and other information.\nWhile knowing your PSA level is helpful, the decision to have a PSA test has to be taken seriously after weighing up all factors and discussing the implications with your GP or hospital doctor.\nIt is possible that prostate cancer will not be found even if you have an elevated PSA. However, it may be present even if your PSA level is low.\nYour doctor may want to take further tests. If you have doubts or questions about your health, you should always contact your GP or hospital doctor. This is particularly important if you have questions which arise from the use of our prostate cancer risk calculator.\nIt cannot be ruled out that the way the Rotterdam Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator for iOS is used, or the indications given by it, are interpreted in a manner that is not appropriate. The creators of the Rotterdam Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator for iOS do not accept any responsibility in any respect.\nThe European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer has published its 11-year follow-up results (New England Journal of Medicine, March 15 2012). Once again, they demonstrate that screening does significantly reduce death from prostate cancer. The latest study confirms that a man who undergoes PSA testing will have his risk of dying from prostate cancer reduced by 29%.\nERSPC is the world’s largest randomized prostate cancer screening study. It was designed to investigate whether early detection and treatment of prostate cancer might reduce disease-specific mortality and also help to identify men at risk. From 1992, the ERSPC study randomized 162,000 men, aged 55 to 69, across Europe to either a screening arm or a control group.\n\nDesigned and developed for iOS by Nuno Azevedo of Ydeal.net Software LDA"

      "label": "BiliMatic is a tool that makes it easy for healthcare professionals to compare a newborn's serum bilirubin levels with standardized reference ranges for a given patient's age and risk factors according to Clinical Practice Guidelines established by the American Academic of Pediatrics.\n\nBiliMatic makes it easy to determine hours from birth to lab draw (or users can input this directly), and allows users to easily convert between different units. It includes options for considering a patient's risk factors and gestational age at delivery.\n\nBiliMatic references the American Academy of Pediatric's 2004 Guidelines for Hyperbilirubinemia. Your patient's data is plotted directly onto the AAP's phototherapy reference nomogram, making it easier for you to visualize data. The nomogram is browsable, allowing you to read reference values for low/medium/high risk newborns with a touch of your finger. The Bhutani nomogram for designating risk of hyperbilirubinemia is also provided.\n\nBiliMatic's beautiful and simple-to-use interface is optimized for modern iOS and iPadOS devices. The app works in both Imperial (mg/dL) and SI (µmol/L) units, and will even remember your preference and adjust nomogram axes appropriately. Users have the option of calculating a neonate's age by dates, or they can input it directly.\n\nBiliMatic is a handy tool that's useful for many users, whether you're a paediatrician, family doctor, nurse, resident, or medical student! BiliMatic is intended for use by medical professionals. If you are a patient, consult your doctor or healthcare provider for medical advice."

      "label": "Designed by a pediatrician, BiliCalc uses the American Academy of Pediatrics 2004 \"Management of Hyperbilirubinemia in Infants Greater than 35 Weeks of Age\" to calculate the threshold for starting phototherapy based on the patient's age, bilirubin level, and neurotoxicity risk. Values are now displayed on the phototherapy nomogram. In addition, it will also tell you the patient's risk zone using the Bhutani Nomogram.\n\nAllows direct age input and includes the option to calculate age from birth and lab sample times. The app has a direct link to source journal articles, nomograms, and a list of the neurotoxicity risk factors. Supports US and SI units (mg/dL and µmol/L).\n\nApp Feature Summary\n-Calculates phototherapy threshold for newborns 35 weeks and older\n-Displays values on phototherapy nomogram\n-Suggests time frame for followup bilirubin levels based on patient risk zone \n-Direct links to reference journal articles\n\n**********************************\nFrequently Asked Questions\n**********************************\n1. I think the graph is backwards. Why is low risk on top and high risk on bottom?\n\nThe graph is directly from the 2004 AAP Hyperbilirubinemia Guidelines. The degree of \"risk\" refers to the infant's risk for developing neurotoxicity. This is different than the Bhutani Nomogram in which \"risk\" refers to the risk for development of severe hyperbilirubinemia. The threshold for treatment (when a data point lies above one of the lines on the graph) of the infant is different based on the predisposing factors (divided into the three risk categories). Babies who are \"low neurotoxicity risk,\" can tolerate higher levels of bilirubin than a baby with medium or high risk. Therefore, a high risk baby will be treated at lower bilirubin levels than a low risk baby. The graph is correct in having low risk on top since a higher value is needed to pass the threshold for treatment (phototherapy). Please see the graph here for verification as well: http://bit.ly/AppPWU. Please email if you have further questions.\n\n******************************************\nIntended for use by pediatricians, neonatologists, physicians, medical students, and pediatric nurses who treat newborn infants in the hospital and as outpatients.\n\nBiliCalc should be used only as a reference aid. The information contained in the app should not be used as a substitute for the exercise of professional clinical judgement.

Why not be able to choose based on how you are holding the phone and what else you are doing at the same time?\n    • Use the numeric entry pad (0 3 3 0 2 0 0 8) and immediately see the results, OR\n    • Spin the date wheel at the bottom of the screen and tap Next.\n\n 3) Thorough results: All the information you would expect from a classic wheel, plus more:\n   • Estimated Due Date\n   • LMP Date\n   • Conception Date\n   • 1st Trimester End Date\n   • 2nd Trimester End Date\n   • Gestational Age\n   • Conceptional Age\n   • Expected Fetal Length based on standard fetal growth curves\n   • Expected Fetal Weight based on standard fetal growth curves (\"How much does my baby weigh, doctor?\")\n\nResults are relative to 'today' by default; this can be quickly changed to reflect any date by tapping the 'today' button and selecting a new date.\n\n 4) Accurate results: Perfect OB Wheel provides exact dates and accounts for all calendar variance, including leap years. \n\n 5) Persistence: Perfect OB Wheel remembers the date and date type you last used and restores them when launched to streamline your workflow.\n\n 6) Perfect OB Tracker upgrade: Available as an in-app purchase update, the Perfect OB Tracker lets you track any number of pregnancies, with at-a-glance due date and gestational age and one-tap access to all the data Perfect OB Wheel provides.

      "label": "Much of the main content of this app focuses on prevention education and strategies to reduce the risks of certain illnesses or traumatic events. Standard medical assessment, diagnosis, treatment, and specific evacuation considerations for many traumatic, medical, and environmental illnesses routinely encountered while in the back country are also presented comprehensively.\n\nIn addition, extensive content on subjective decision-making errors, first aid kit recommendations, patient assessment, medications and pain management, trip checklist functions, and cardiac arrest management are included.\nMany accidents in the back country can be avoided, and a main focus in this app is on prevention strategies. Significant content unique to this app is the inclusion of “trip checklists”. Checklists have been utilized for a long time in the aviation industry to prevent and react to critical situations, so that important steps are not missed. In this app, the checklists are intended to ritualize discussion of, and provide a framework for, the consideration of common subjective decision-making errors and heuristic factors before, during, and after a trip. Most accidents, or medical care that results in a worse outcome for the patient, will prove to be significantly attributable to these factors, rather than solely a failure of the acquisition or performance of the right skills and knowledge.\n\nThis app is mainly geared to the person with little or no medical training, up to a person with a Wilderness EMT, but even people who routinely practice medicine may find useful information within the app regarding environmental illness, subjective decision-making errors, and checklist functions when venturing into the backcountry. Commonly accepted wilderness protocols normally considered outside the scope of non-physician or pre-hospital care providers are contained within. These treatments are the administration of epinephrine for anaphylaxis or asthma, administration of glucagon injection for patients with extremely low blood sugar, reduction of shoulder, patella, or finger dislocation, evaluation of the spine for injury, cessation of CPR, avalanche resuscitation, tourniquet conversion and wound management, which may be performed with direction from a programmatic physician advisor following training.\n\n1. Functions well outside with offline capability. \n2. Text size may be conveniently increased.  \n3. Links contained within take you to relevant content referenced, like   \n    medical information.\n 4. Real life case studies included to illustrate key points about different \n     content."

      "label": "Squeezy has helped thousands of women regain confidence in their pelvic floor. Pelvic health specialists around the world recommend Squeezy to their patients every day because it works.\n\nAround 30,000 people use Squeezy regularly to help them remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises. So if you are thinking about downloading Squeezy for your pelvic floor, you are not alone. \n\nAll women should be doing these exercises and some will be doing them as part of a physiotherapy programme.\n\nSqueezy is simple to use, informative and designed to help women to remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises (also known as Kegel exercises). \n\nFeatures includes:\n• A pre-set exercise plan that follows public health guidelines\n• A record of the number of exercises you have completed, compared to your target\n• Visual and audio guides for exercises\n• Exercise reminders with customisable settings\n• Educational information about the pelvic floor\n• “Professional mode” – if working with a pelvic health specialist, you can tailor the exercise plan to fit your needs\n• A bladder diary to keep track of your symptoms, if required\n• Simple and clear interface\n\nSqueezy has been clinically reviewed and approved by the NHS for its clinical safety, and is compliant with NHS Information Governance requirements.\n\nSqueezy won several industry awards including ehi Awards 2016, Health Innovation Network 2016, National Continence Care Awards 2015/16 and was a finalist for awards including Advancing Healthcare Awards 2014 and 2017, Abbvie Sustainable Healthcare Awards 2016.\n\nFor more about Squeezy and additional pelvic health information visit squeezyapp.com.\n\n*Apple Watch users*\nDuring your exercises you need to hold your finger on your Apple Watch face to keep it live and running. The play button changes to state ‘Hold’ when running an exercise.\n\nThis keeps your Watch from dozing off while your attention is focused on your pelvic floor. Most Watch screens go to sleep after 7 or 15 seconds (time dependent on your Watch settings). Squeezy has no control over the screen sleep time on the Watch; it has to obey your Watch settings. \n\nWe hope to be able to improve the Watch experience in future. In the meantime, we’re continuing the existing Watch support because many people find it helpful.\n\nIf you have feedback on the Apple Watch, please get in touch with the developers directly on help@squeezyapp.com.\n\n\nThis app has been translated into Saudi Arabian Arabic.\nتمت ترجمه هذا التطبيق الى اللغه العربيه ( المملكه العربيه السعوديه)‏"

This app is available in two editions— Advanced Life Support (ALS) and Basic & Intermediate Life Support (BLS)—designed specifically to correspond with each tier of EMT certification and practice, so you know you have the right tool for your job.\n\nThe Advanced Life Support (ALS) app equips the Paramedic or EMT-P to triage and address trauma.

Wherever you are within the allied health professions - medical school, nursing school, NP school, PA school, residency, and beyond - you can improve your knowledge base in the short and long term with these key associative memory aids.\n\nMedical Mnemonics puts 1796 clever acronyms, rhymes, and memory tricks on your iPhone or iPod Touch, covering topics ranging from Anatomy and Biochemistry to Pharmacology and Surgery.\n\nThe database is fully searchable and can be quickly filtered by discipline and by system. Create a Favorites list, and search and filter it similarly.\n\nThe best mnemonics can be those you make yourself. Add your own mnemonics to the database, where they'll appear seamlessly alongside those which come with the program.  Submit them instantaneously to the Medical Mnemonics server for review by an MD (that's me!) and inclusion in the next version.\n\nYou can email any mnemonic to a colleague from within Medical Mnemonics. He or she can view it within the email or add it to their own copy of Medical Mnemonics with a single click.\n\nUpdates will be free for life and will include new mnemonics submitted by users (that's you!) and added as we all continue learning together.\n\nEvery mnemonic is physician-reviewed, but we're only human.

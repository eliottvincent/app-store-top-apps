      "label": "Pregnant? This is for YOU!\nOur leading app allows you to use just your iPhone microphone to record and share your baby’s sounds. It is the best-in-class, has excellent reviews, is super simple and safe to use. Now supports Apple Airpods and Bluetooth Headphones.\n\n\"It took some time and patience... thank you for creating this cheap, awesome technology to use at home.\" - Niki\n\nCategory #1 in the USA and 102 other countries. Here's why...\n\nDeveloped by parents like you (with expertise in sound engineering and app development) who wanted a trustworthy, safe and easy-to-use way to record our baby's fetal sounds (kicks, heartbeat etc.) - and keep a record of a quality that we hadn't been able to find before in other apps. It has been extensively tested on expectant mothers.\n\n\"I was skeptical at first. Great app! Worth it.\" - Legretta \n\n**** But honestly, does it actually work?? ****\nYes. We've sound-engineered ways to attempt to isolate the baby's heart beat, sounds (kicks, heart beat and more) and using an advanced algorithm, amplify them making them easier to detect and hear.\n\nNOTE: It takes time, technique and patience and depends on the position and number of weeks of your baby so you'll need to stick with it. When you do, our results are excellent. Results are best between 27-40 weeks as your baby is bigger and stronger. \n\nWe constantly improve our extensive tutorial and techniques to handhold you through - we even have a support group on Facebook so you can get help.\n\nWe want you to be happy with Hear My Baby heartbeat and getting results can sometimes be difficult.  If you are struggling (can't find your own heartbeat etc. DO contact us via support. We want to help you!\n\nGIFT THIS APP: Click the “Buy App” arrow on the iTunes® App Store\n\n\nFAQs\n\n**** No Accessories Required ****\nWe use the internal microphone from your phone to attempt to listen and record your fetal sound. We recommend Bluetooth Headphones for best results.\n\n**** How It Works ****\n1. Hear My Baby, has been precisely engineered to listen to abdominal sounds, then record and amplify them. Listen to your own heartbeat first to confirm the app is set up correctly. \n2. It works best when baby is head down and their back is facing forwards.\n3. Remove the case, be in a very quiet room and focus on your lower abdomen. Listen then Tap record.\n4. Our simple recording management helps you to keep a record of your special moment\n5. Take a selfie if you wish and share \n6. We'll walk you through exactly how to get the best baby heartbeat results.\n\n**** Easy Share Feature ****\nSharing is awesome you can opt to share via Facebook, Whats App, Instagram or email.\n\n**** We Care About Your Privacy ****\nWe take your privacy and special moment seriously. You decide who sees or hears it and can delete it at any time.\n\n**** Before you start... ****\nYou DO need to carefully follow the instructions for Hear My Baby to work. A quiet room is critical for results as the mic is super sensitive.   HMB doesn't fake the baby heartbeat or other fetal sounds :) \n\nPlease Note: results are normally superb, however the recording may not work if your placenta is at the front of the tummy or the baby is in the wrong position.\n\n**** Supported Phones ****\n13,12, X, Xs, 11, 11 Pro, 8, 7, 7+, SE, 6s, 6s+, 6, 6+ 5c, 5s & 5. We don't support iPad.\n\n**** Worried about safety? We are too! ***\nHMB is safe but to be extra sure DO switch your iPhone to airplane mode. This is a precaution and automatically stops all cellular transmissions.\n\n**** Is it a substitute for medical devices/support? ****\nNo - under no circumstances is HMB a substitute for medical support - if you don't get a result it doesn't mean anything is wrong :) Consult your doctor for any advice. We are NOT approved by the FDA. This is not a medical device and is not a medical baby heartbeat monitor. It is for FUN.\n\nPlease do check our T&Cs before downloading.\n\nFor results examples: www.facebook.com/hearmybaby\nwww.instagram.com/hearmybabyapp"

She will help you relax between surges with a mix of guided relaxations, positive affirmations, gentle music and calming visualisations. Freya makes it easy for you to keep track of your surges and you can visit the log at any point to see how frequently your surges are coming and how long they are lasting. Freya will also let you know when your labour is established and when it might be a good time to contact your midwife. You will never birth alone with Freya by your side.\n \nTRACK YOUR SURGES\n\nIn hypnobirthing we refer to contractions as surges, as a ‘surge’ more accurately describes the sensation you’ll experience when in labour. Freya is the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the app store, designed specifically with hypnobirthing mums in mind, but can be used by anyone.\n \nPREPARE FOR BIRTH\n\nYou can also use Freya in pregnancy to help you relax and prepare for your birth. In fact the more you listen to the guided relaxations and positive affirmations, the more familiar they will become and the more effective they will be at helping you relax when it comes to birth. Positive affirmations have been proven to change the way your mind works and listening regularly will help you feel less anxious and more confident in the lead up to birth. \n \nTHE SCIENCE\n\nWe know the more relaxed you are during birth, the more oxytocin you will produce. Oxytocin helps your uterus to work efficiently, making labour faster and more comfortable. \n \nLIFESKILLS\n\nYou can also use Freya post-birth any time you feel you could benefit from taking some deep breaths or need some help finding your zen. Everything you learn through using Freya - mindfulness exercises, breathing techniques, the benefits of taking time out - are skills for life.\n\nIf you have any questions or spot any pesky bugs lurking about the place (!) please do let us know at help@thepositivebirthcompany.co.uk\n\nWHAT YOU’LL GET:\n\niPhone and Apple Watch app\nA timer to record your surges (also known as a contraction timer)\nCoaching audio to keep your mind focused on breathing through each surge\nA gentle expanding visualisation which you can use to sync your breathing\nA detailed log of your surges over time, so you can track your progress through labour\nAbility to easily share the log with your birth partner, midwife or doula\nGuided relaxations, positive affirmations and soothing visuals to help keep you calm and relaxed, making birth easier, quicker and more straightforward (can also be used in pregnancy and postnatally)\nCoaching created by renowned hypnobirthing expert Siobhan Miller, founder of The Positive Birth Company\n\nDownload the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the App Store and prepare to meet your baby in the best possible way, feeling calm and confident, relaxed and happy!"

The guidelines articles, as published in the Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease, as well as the comprehensive risk estimates, can be accessed through https://www.asccp.org/guidelines.  \n\nThese evidence-based management guidelines, initially developed in 2019, came together through a consensus process of 19 organizations. The updated management guidelines aim to:\n • Allow for a more complete and precise estimation of risk\n • Provide more appropriate intervention for high-risk individuals (detect and treat more precancer)\n • Recommend less intervention for low-risk individuals (decrease testing and treatment that won’t prevent cancer and may cause reproductive harm)\n • Allow for the future addition of new risk modifiers and screening and management technologies\n\nSee https://www.asccp.org/UserGuide for tips on using the app."

Using this app is the equivalent to spending hours with the world’s most experienced doctors teaching you about your calcium, parathyroid, osteoporosis, and vitamin D issues. Your tests results are analyzed to determine if a problem exists, what risks are associated, and what to do about it. Beautiful graphs make understanding these problems simple!\n\nBlood tests and bone density scans can be difficult to interpret—even many doctors do not diagnose calcium, vitamin D, and parathyroid problems correctly or timely. Hyperparathyroidism is a disease that affects 1 in 800 people and 1 in 250 women over 50 and is very often overlooked while patients suffer from chronic fatigue, memory loss, depression, osteoporosis, bone pain and many other symptoms. Calcium Pro is a powerful software program that will analyze your calcium health and provide you guidance about the status of your bones, kidneys, parathyroid glands, vitamin D, and other related health issues.\n\nYou start by entering your test results for calcium, parathyroid hormone, and vitamin D. Then we look at your bone density (osteoporosis levels). CalciumPro will analyze and graph your tests making them easy to understand. It will let you know the status of your parathyroid glands and your chance of having hyperparathyroidism. Suggested next steps are given. Tracking tools will show your calcium and vitamin D levels over time, and will show if your bones are losing density (worsening osteoporosis), or gaining bone density. There are important learning tools on every page, and an extensive video and reading library at the end. The app will provide guidance about talking to your physician regarding the possible need for surgery and other important steps.\n\nA Risk Assessment Tool shows your relative risk for conditions associated with high blood calcium: Osteoporosis, Heart Disease, Heart Arrhythmias and Palpitations, High Blood Pressure, Kidney Stones and Kidney Failure, GERD, several Cancers, and others. Watch your risk assessment graphs change as you address your calcium problems. \n\nThis app was developed by doctors at the Norman Parathyroid Center, the world’s leading parathyroid and calcium treatment center using over 4,000,000 data points from over 30,000 patients. Let the world’s leading doctors help you understand these problems so you and your doctor can make important, informed decisions. Take control of your own health!"

      "label": "This app is intended for obstetricians, midwives, and nurses who use electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) in laboring patients.   In addition to interpreting fetal heart rate (FHR) tracings, health care professionals must communicate with each other about the tracings in a way that is understood by all parties, and decide what action to take.\n\nFHR 5-tier is based on the five-color system developed by Drs. Julian Parer and Tomoaki Ikeda.  (AJOG July 2007) The intent of their system is to standardize management of different fetal heart rate tracings. The system divides all fetal heart rate tracings into one of five categories:  Green (no acidemia, no intervention required), Blue, Yellow, Orange or Red (evidence of actual or impending fetal asphyxia, rapid delivery recommended).   Each color has assigned to it a:  a) risk of acidemia, b) risk of evolution to a more serious pattern and c) recommended action.\n\nThe NICHD three-tier system of classifying fetal heart rate (FHR) tracings has been criticized for having too wide a range of tracings in “Category II”. Some researchers and clinicians believe that the five-tier color-coded system more effectively classifies EFM tracings.  The five-tier system is being adopted by an increasing number of hospitals in the U.S. and in Japan.\n\nFHR 5-tier makes it easier to use the five-color system.\n\nWithout the FHR 5-tier app, one must refer to a table with 134 possible combinations of variability, baseline, and decelerations.  One must also either memorize or refer to the definitions for mild, moderate and severe decelerations, which are complex and sometimes confusing.\n\nWhen using the FHR 5-tier app it is not necessary to refer to any other table or chart. Variability and baseline, and the shape, nadir, and duration of decelerations are entered with buttons on the consecutive screens. The app calculates the severity of the deceleration and the color for each tracing.  All aspects of the tracing are summarized on the colored results screen, so that the user can quickly communicate with others.\n\nManagement recommendations as outlined by Parer and Ikeda are given. These include whether or not the obstetrician needs to be at the bedside; what other personnel should be available; and whether the patient should be moved to the operating room.  In addition, conservative management techniques are listed where appropriate.  Thus, for Blue, Yellow, and Orange tracings, the final results screen reminds the user to consider actions such as maternal position change, decreasing oxytocin, or amnioinfusion.  \n\nAs noted by Parer and Ikeda, the guidelines for management may need to be modified for institutions other then theirs, and may even change depending on time of day.\n\nThe NICHD Category (I, II, III) is also given on the results screen.\n\n This application is intended as a reference tool for use only by licensed healthcare professionals.  This application is not a substitute for each licensed healthcare professional's independent clinical judgment.  No medical decision should be based solely on information obtained by use of this tool.  \n\n\nThis application tries to faithfully aggregate information from major authorities (see references) and does not introduce or substitute the judgment of the makers of this application for those authorities.

      "label": "This is the successor the the popular, award-winning, best selling, doctor recommended pain tracking app, My Pain Diary: Chronic Pain & Symptom Tracker.\n\nThis version, My Pain Diary: GOLD EDITION, strikes a delicate balance between ease-of-use and a broad feature-set. This is a truly USEFUL app, and the newest member of the My Pain Diary family, which has helped over 90,000 chronic pain sufferers better manage their pain, improve communication with their doctors, and gain insights that would be hard attain through other means.\n\nUseful and popular features include automatic weather fetching, iCloud sync, basic medication tracking, photo attachments, graphs and PDF doctor's reports.\n\nThis app is highly customizable. Everyone tracks pain differently, and this is a framework that supports just about any tracking strategy.\n\nCreated by a chronic pain patient to track, manage, and report on chronic pain and symptoms, chronic illness, and mental health.\n\nThat means there is no big company with deep pockets supporting this project. I am just one man with a chronic pain condition, a demanding day job, and a young family to care for. I just happen to be formally trained in design, self-taught in programming, experienced at marketing and customer relations, and am a chronic pain patient myself. That's a very rare combination of traits that is hard to come by, so I'm making the most of it, and holding my own against the big players.\n\nEnough about me, back to the app!\n\nFeatures:\n+   iCloud Sync Support\n+   Universal App\n+   Highly Customizable\n+   Easy to use \n+   Track unlimited conditions\n+   Track multiple/unlimited times per day\n+   Add past entries (change entry timestamp)\n+   Edit past entries\n\nANATOMY OF A PAIN DIARY ENTRY\n\nTRACKERS: Trackers can be thought of as labels or folders that categorize and differentiate your entries. These are the key to tracking more than one condition and comparing conditions to each other.\n\nA common strategy is to name the Trackers after the diseases/conditions that you will be tracking. I.e. Migraines, Anxiety, Fibromyalgia, etc. These are just examples. \n\nMETRICS: Each entry is composed of one or more optional pieces of information called 'Metrics'. For example, two commonly used metrics are 'Pain Intensity' and 'Pain Duration'. Metrics are associated with and shared amongst your Trackers. This means that you can set it up to use different metrics for different Trackers, keeping your entry pages clean and the cognitive load low.\n\n -- MEDICATION TRACKING --\n+   Basic medication tracking.\n\n -- IMPORTANT EVENTS --\n+   Record important events that aren't suited for a Pain Diary entry. i.e. Medical Procedures, Therapy Sessions, A slip and fall, etc.\n\n -- HISTORY --\n+    Color-Coded Calendar - Spot patterns and trends at a glance. Calendar days are colored based on the day's highest recorded Intensity.\n+   Fully searchable.\n+   Day View\n\n -- GRAPHS --\n+   Visualize and compare intensity over time with this interactive graph. Plot and compare up to 3 'Trackables' at once and one optional Weather Metric.\n+   Email, print and share a PDF of the Graph.\n\n -- REPORTS --\n+   Create a PDF Report for your Doctors or for archival purposes. Share the Report via email and other standard methods.\n+   Include Graph\n+   Include Pain Scale Descriptions\n+   Include Color-Coded-Calendar\n+   Include Medication Log\n+   Include Important Events\n\n -- TOOLS --\n+   Automatic Weather Fetching\n+   Pain Scale Editor\n+   Units preference - US/Imperial or XUS/Metric\n\n\nWant to see the app in action?

      "label": "Caution! This app is intended for intensive care physicians. If you are NOT a physician and would like to use it anyway, please consult your physician before using this app or making any medical decisions. This app has endorsement for usage in the Russian Federation.\n\nMany doctors deal with the treatment of patients with varying degrees of acute respiratory failure (ARF). But the choice of the optimal method and, especially, the timely correction of the parameters of invasive and non-invasive mechanical lung ventilation often cause difficulties, especially for young doctors. Unfortunately, expensive ventilation machines, without their skillful use, are not a guarantee of an improvement in the mortality rate in ARF. This has been especially evident during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn international clinical practice, it is customary to determine the degree of ARF by the oxygenation index (the ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2)). This indicator is also included in most \"severity of illness\" scoring systems (SOFA, APACHE II-III, etc.). However PaO2 estimation is only possible after collecting the arterial blood for laboratory monitoring of blood gases, making it costly and invasive.\n\nIn 2020-2021 a multicenter research was carried out at five clinical hospitals in Volgograd, Russia, which included 1038 patients with acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome against the background of viral (COVID-19) and bacterial pneumonia. The goals of the research were firstly, to develop a non-invasive method for determining the oxygenation index (PaO2 / FiO2) based on oxygen saturation (SpO2), and secondly, to define general criteria for correcting the parameters of invasive and non-invasive mechanical ventilation.\n\nThis application is based on the results of the research. The relationship between SpO2 and PaO2 index values was determined for various FiO2 and types of respiratory support. The app also implements the general principle of oxygen therapy - from less to more invasive. The app allows the user not only to choose the most effective method of respiratory support, but also timely learn about the need for its correction.\n\nEvery clinician knows that the mortality rate in patients with ARF is greatly influenced by the validity of the beginning and end of Invasive Mechanical Ventilation treatment - and this app solves this problem.\n\nThe educational effect of this app should also be noted. It will help doctors to quickly master and more competently use expensive ventilation machines, which, of course, will have a beneficial effect on the results of treatment of patients with ARF.\n\nThe following sources were used to create the app:\n1.

      "label": "Do you have tinnitus or “ringing in the ears”? Tinnitus HQ helps you understand and relieve your tinnitus symptoms.\n\nRecent research shows that tinnitus can be treated by listening to sounds that have been filtered to remove your specific tinnitus frequencies.*\n\nWith Tinnitus HQ, you can apply advanced filters to over 500 high-quality sounds to find relief for your symptoms.\n\nSimply apply a bandpass filter to any sound or mix to isolate frequencies in a narrow range. Move this filter up and down the frequency range until it closely matches the ringing frequency in your ears. \n\nAdd a bandstop filter at these frequencies to any sound or mix to create your tinnitus mask.\n\nThe advanced filters can be applied to both ears or just one ear, and different frequency ranges can be used for each ear.\n\nYou can set a wide range of filter widths from 0.1 to 4.0 octaves, down to 1Hz resolution.\n\nAnd you can adjust the volume level in each ear with a single balance control.\n\nWith Tinnitus HQ you can create advanced natural-sounding tinnitus masks to help relieve your tinnitus symptoms. \n\nTinnitus HQ features:\n\n• Over 500 high-quality natural sound recordings\n• Precision bandpass and bandstop filters to identify and mask ringing frequencies\n• Wide frequency range: 128 Hz to 16 kHz\n• Filter widths from 0.1 to 4.0 Octaves, settable to 1Hz resolution\n• Two-ear and single-ear filtering capability\n• Independent Left-Right ear filter frequencies and widths\n• Left-Right ear volume balance control\n• Easy-to-create blended mixes of any 4 sounds\n• Runs in background while using other apps or when the screen is locked\n• Timer with slow audio fade-out\n• Beautiful high-definition images from around the globe\n• Modern easy-to-use interface\n• 15 different natural sound categories, including Rain, Rivers & Streams, Ocean, Lakes, Wind, Water Fountains, Fire, Birds, Crickets & Insects, Cars, Trains, Public Places, Household, Industrial, Soundscapes.\n\nDownload Tinnitus HQ now.\n\n\n* See http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0138595, http://www.pnas.org/content/107/3/1207.full, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2918775/ for descriptions of notched sound therapy and its positive results.\n\n* Please talk with your doctor about ringing in the ears and any other symptoms.

Covering over 80 muscles with more than 150 trigger points.\n\nMyofascial trigger points are one of the most common sources of pain, and are often overlooked by health professionals. \n\nThis app strives to help you find the source of pain via intuitive interface: tap the body where your pain is and see which trigger points refer pain to that area. Over 50 distinct pain areas are covered.\n\nYou can also find trigger points by by tapping a muscle on the muscle model, by choosing a muscle from the alphabetized list, or by using the search bar. If you don't know exactly what you're looking for, you can search using keywords such as \"elbow\", which will show the muscles of the elbow as well as any pain areas or conditions related to the elbow (e.g. \"lateral elbow pain\", \"tennis elbow\").\n\nTrigger points can cause or mimic a variety of conditions such as \"Tendinitis\" and \"Tennis Elbow\". More than 40 conditions are covered. Choose a condition and see a list of muscles whose trigger points can cause or mimic that condition.\n\nIn each trigger point illustration, an \"x\" marks the location of the point, while the area of referred pain is colored in blue.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: this app does not include treatment information; its aim is to help find the source of specific pain. Once you've identified a trigger point please consult a massage therapist or otherwise trained professional. There are also myriad self-treatment resources available both in book and video format should you choose to treat yourself.\n\n4520c652df"

Physical Therapist Content Master is designed to assist physical therapists to possess full command of core academic content. Physical Therapist Content Master is an ideal tool for physical therapist students, recent physical therapy graduates, and licensed physical therapists.\n\nThe academic content is organized into unique system and non-system categories. \n\nMusculoskeletal System\nNeuromuscular System\nCardiopulmonary System\nOther Systems\nEquipment and Devices\nTherapeutic Modalities\nSafety and Protection\nProfessional Responsibilities\nResearch\n\nPhysical therapists can review selected content by scrolling through subcategories in each of the system and non-system areas. Our innovative design presents academic content in a user-friendly format that allows users to easily digest essential information. Users rate their competence in a variety of topics and create personalized Study Stacks. Study Stacks allow users to efficiently remediate identified academic deficiencies. Frequent review of essential academic content allows users to successfully convert the information to long-term memory. \n\nPhysical Therapist Content Master includes an assessment mode that consists of 750 multiple-choice questions. Each multiple-choice question has four unique options and an explanation supporting the correct answer. The multiple-choice questions are designed to assess a user’s mastery of the information presented in the content review mode. The number of questions in each category varies from a minimum of 25 to a maximum of 175. Our Content Tag feature allows users to quickly review questions by topic area (i.e., special tests, cranial nerves, pulmonary function tests). \n\nA formal score report describes a physical therapist’s level of mastery cumulatively, by category, and by timeline. Each of the individual reports provides users with valuable performance data to assess their present level of academic mastery. Utilization of the app on a frequent basis considerably strengthens a physical therapist’s knowledge base and provides the necessary foundation to progress to higher level licensing-like questions. \n\nCompany Information\nScorebuilders is a physical therapist owned company whose sole focus is to prepare students for the National Physical Therapy Examinations. We sell more review products and offer more review courses than any other company. Scorebuilders has experienced three decades of continuous growth and is the recognized leader in physical therapy licensing preparation. Scorebuilders offers candidates the knowledge and insight necessary to achieve their goal of becoming a licensed physical therapist on the first attempt.\n\nCopyright © 2019 Scorebuilders\n\nPhysical Therapist Content Master is the exclusive property of Scorebuilders.

Most of the bones are bilateral... one on each side, so we don't quiz the right femur and left femur, this cuts the list down almost in half. Many bones are repeat... 12 ribs on each side, 10 distal phalanges, 10 proximal phalanges...

The method has been used in more than 30 international clinical studies in the past 20 years. \n\nIt gives you the ability to assess and quantify your tremor and to keep track of your values. You can upload your results as Text Files to your iCloud Drive for further visualization, or to share and import them to personal EHR apps. \n\nFor more information, visit www.studymyhealth.com\n\nTremor is the notion for the trembling of a limb. Most prominent is the trembling of the outstretched hand, that everyone is aware of in special situations like excitement or strenuous workouts. Whereas a light trembling of the hand is present in all humans, increased amplitude of the trembling can lead to serious problems in daily life. Increased trembling could be a symptom of a wide variety of diseases, as Parkinson's disease, essential tremor disease, hypothyroidism, or various psychiatric conditions.\n\nTHIS APP IS NOT INTENDED TO DIAGNOSE, TREAT, OR CURE ANY DISEASE.\n\nNote: Tremor severity and frequency are not supported by iHealth; as soon as these values are available we will connect the App to the iHealth ecosystem. \n\niPad Users: Note that the App is not working on the iPad; it does NOT make sense to measure hand tremor using an iPad, the device is too large and heavy to perform the measurements."

It was to assist those who are likely to perform these functions that this app was created.\n\n\nFeatures:\n• Easy to use event logging. The app comes with around 100 events in several predefined categories (drugs, procedures and other events), with the possibility of adding many more. These can marked as favorites for easy selection, or searched for by name and category.\n• Logging the amount of time elapsed since activation.\n• Audio and visual alarms for events.\n• A log book for past events, with the date and time during the procedure in which they were added. They can be exported in text format to either clipboard or e-mail.\n• A metronome to facilitate the performance of cardiac massage with the correct frequency on your phone.\n• Apple Watch Support with glances notifications and event logging.\n• Support for Live Activities and Dynamic Island for showing the current CPR time, last Events and Vitals in the lock screen."

Use the \"Share Trial\" button to send a PubMed link and quick summary. Using this feature, it’s incredibly easy to share pivotal critical care trials with students, residents, and other colleagues.\n\nThe database features 150+ landmark trials related to: ARDS, cardiac arrest, DVT/PE, delirium, glycemic control, heart failure, hemorrhage, meningitis, nephroprotection, nutrition, pneumonia, sedation, seizure, sepsis/shock, spinal cord injury, stroke, and subarachnoid hemorrhage – with more trials and topics to be added on a regular basis!\n\nThis app is designed and maintained by Sean P.

Created by Tom Bouthillet electrocardiography expert and popular ECG blogger, this app contains 180 clinically obtained 12-lead ECGs to provide you the practice, insights and confidence you need!\n\nThe 12-Lead ECG Challenge app presents a wide variety of cardiac pathologies including a special emphasis on acute STEMI and the STEMI mimics, electrolyte imbalances and others. If you are responsible for cath lab activation, this program is ideal for honing skills and preventing false activation.\n\nEach case begins with the patient complaint and the actual field or hospital 12-lead ECG. You will be able to examine each 12-lead and come to a diagnostic conclusion. ECGs are expandable and movable for easy viewing on phones, computers or tablets. After choosing “answer” you will see a detailed analysis of the 12-lead – many times with highlights graphically superimposed over the strip itself to show areas of interest.\n\nThe 12-Lead ECG challenge allows you to choose 5, 10 or 20 strips at a time as well as a feature allowing you to exclude questions you have already mastered from the program.\n\nApp Highlights:\n\n• Phone or tablet- no problem! ECGs expand and move on your screen for easy viewing. • 150 high-quality 12-lead ECGs. • 12-leads are presented with the actual patient complaint/scenario. • Detailed rationale answers including actual diagnosis and graphical reference demonstrating key points on the ECG itself. • Highlights acute STEMI, STEMI mimics, cath lab activation recommendations, electrolyte imbalances, and other cardiac and atypical presentations and anginal equivalents."

      "label": "Bilateral Stimulation Therapy (BLST) is a neuropsychological treatment adapted from a treatment called EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing). EMDR is a gold standard treatment according to the World Health Organisation for the psychological treatment of trauma. Bilateral Stimulation is a key therapeutic tool used in EMDR. \n\nBilateral Stimulation simply means stimulation of both sides of the brain using eye movements, sound or tactile stimulation. Typically, it may involve moving your eyes from left to right whilst following a target or paying attention to sound in your left ear then to your right. Bilateral stimulation is referred to as a ‘bottom – up’ approach as it works on the emotion engine of the brain, the limbic system. This approach reduces emotional distress which allows the cortical areas of the brain (thinking, reasoning, planning) to become more active and effective. The effect of this approach is often experienced more quickly and easily.\n\nBecause this therapy uses one element of EMDR, it is called BLST so as to not confuse or give the user a wrong impression about the complete standard EMDR therapy. BLST uses one part of EMDR, and therefore 2can be practiced at home, work or any quiet environment where you can spend five minutes or so undisturbed much like meditation. For more information about BLST and EMDR please visit www.mromeopsych.com/blst\n\nThis minimal app uses bilateral click which, when activated, sounds alternately in each ear. The speed, tone and length of the practice can be set by the user. The App has two options: 1. BLST mode (bilateral stimulation with sound) and 2. FLASH (an adaption of Dr Phillip Manfield’s FLASH technique. Please visit https://www.flashtechnique.com for more information).\n\nThis app is a clinical tool for psychologists, psychiatrists, EMDR therapists and their patients. While information is provided at www.mromeopsych.com/blst, you should consult your EMDR therapist before using it. Please note: Persons suffering with complex PTSD Dissociative Identity Disorder, Borderline Personality, Schizophrenia or unstable neurological conditions (eg; epilepsy) should not use this product without consultation with your therapist.\n\nAs we are frequently updating this app to improve it’s functionality and increase its features, we ask that any comments or suggestions that you have, please contact us at admin@mromeopsych.com. Thank you."

      "label": "Pregnant? This is for YOU!\nOur leading app allows you to use just your iPhone microphone to record and share your baby’s sounds. It is the best-in-class, has excellent reviews, is super simple and safe to use. Now supports Apple Airpods and Bluetooth Headphones.\n\n\"It took some time and patience... thank you for creating this cheap, awesome technology to use at home.\" - Niki\n\nCategory #1 in the USA and 102 other countries. Here's why...\n\nDeveloped by parents like you (with expertise in sound engineering and app development) who wanted a trustworthy, safe and easy-to-use way to record our baby's fetal sounds (kicks, heartbeat etc.) - and keep a record of a quality that we hadn't been able to find before in other apps. It has been extensively tested on expectant mothers.\n\n\"I was skeptical at first. Great app! Worth it.\" - Legretta \n\n**** But honestly, does it actually work?? ****\nYes. We've sound-engineered ways to attempt to isolate the baby's heart beat, sounds (kicks, heart beat and more) and using an advanced algorithm, amplify them making them easier to detect and hear.\n\nNOTE: It takes time, technique and patience and depends on the position and number of weeks of your baby so you'll need to stick with it. When you do, our results are excellent. Results are best between 27-40 weeks as your baby is bigger and stronger. \n\nWe constantly improve our extensive tutorial and techniques to handhold you through - we even have a support group on Facebook so you can get help.\n\nWe want you to be happy with Hear My Baby heartbeat and getting results can sometimes be difficult.  If you are struggling (can't find your own heartbeat etc. DO contact us via support. We want to help you!\n\nGIFT THIS APP: Click the “Buy App” arrow on the iTunes® App Store\n\n\nFAQs\n\n**** No Accessories Required ****\nWe use the internal microphone from your phone to attempt to listen and record your fetal sound. We recommend Bluetooth Headphones for best results.\n\n**** How It Works ****\n1. Hear My Baby, has been precisely engineered to listen to abdominal sounds, then record and amplify them. Listen to your own heartbeat first to confirm the app is set up correctly. \n2. It works best when baby is head down and their back is facing forwards.\n3. Remove the case, be in a very quiet room and focus on your lower abdomen. Listen then Tap record.\n4. Our simple recording management helps you to keep a record of your special moment\n5. Take a selfie if you wish and share \n6. We'll walk you through exactly how to get the best baby heartbeat results.\n\n**** Easy Share Feature ****\nSharing is awesome you can opt to share via Facebook, Whats App, Instagram or email.\n\n**** We Care About Your Privacy ****\nWe take your privacy and special moment seriously. You decide who sees or hears it and can delete it at any time.\n\n**** Before you start... ****\nYou DO need to carefully follow the instructions for Hear My Baby to work. A quiet room is critical for results as the mic is super sensitive.   HMB doesn't fake the baby heartbeat or other fetal sounds :) \n\nPlease Note: results are normally superb, however the recording may not work if your placenta is at the front of the tummy or the baby is in the wrong position.\n\n**** Supported Phones ****\n13,12, X, Xs, 11, 11 Pro, 8, 7, 7+, SE, 6s, 6s+, 6, 6+ 5c, 5s & 5. We don't support iPad.\n\n**** Worried about safety? We are too! ***\nHMB is safe but to be extra sure DO switch your iPhone to airplane mode. This is a precaution and automatically stops all cellular transmissions.\n\n**** Is it a substitute for medical devices/support? ****\nNo - under no circumstances is HMB a substitute for medical support - if you don't get a result it doesn't mean anything is wrong :) Consult your doctor for any advice. We are NOT approved by the FDA. This is not a medical device and is not a medical baby heartbeat monitor. It is for FUN.\n\nPlease do check our T&Cs before downloading.\n\nFor results examples: www.facebook.com/hearmybaby\nwww.instagram.com/hearmybabyapp"

Around 75% of people with IBS experience symptom relief on a low FODMAP diet.\n\nThe app comes directly from the research team at Monash and includes the following:\n\n- General information about the FODMAP diet and IBS.\n- Easy to understand tutorials to guide you through the app and the 3-Step FODMAP diet.\n- A Food Guide detailing the FODMAP content for hundreds of foods using a simple 'traffic light system'. \n- A list of branded products that have been certified by Monash as low FODMAP.\n- A collection of over 70 nutritious, low FODMAP recipes.\n- Functions that allow you to create your own shopping list and add notes to individual foods\n- A Diary that enables you to record food eaten, IBS symptoms, bowel habits and stress levels. The Diary will also guide you through step 2 of the diet - FODMAP reintroduction.\n- The ability to adjust units of measurement (metric or imperial) and activate colour blindness assistance."

The updated management guidelines aim to:\n • Allow for a more complete and precise estimation of risk\n • Provide more appropriate intervention for high-risk individuals (detect and treat more precancer)\n • Recommend less intervention for low-risk individuals (decrease testing and treatment that won’t prevent cancer and may cause reproductive harm)\n • Allow for the future addition of new risk modifiers and screening and management technologies\n\nSee https://www.asccp.org/UserGuide for tips on using the app."

      "label": "Meet Freya, your virtual birth partner from The Positive Birth Company! Freya will coach you through every single surge with a simple breathing technique and visualisation. She will help you relax between surges with a mix of guided relaxations, positive affirmations, gentle music and calming visualisations. Freya makes it easy for you to keep track of your surges and you can visit the log at any point to see how frequently your surges are coming and how long they are lasting. Freya will also let you know when your labour is established and when it might be a good time to contact your midwife. You will never birth alone with Freya by your side.\n \nTRACK YOUR SURGES\n\nIn hypnobirthing we refer to contractions as surges, as a ‘surge’ more accurately describes the sensation you’ll experience when in labour. Freya is the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the app store, designed specifically with hypnobirthing mums in mind, but can be used by anyone.\n \nPREPARE FOR BIRTH\n\nYou can also use Freya in pregnancy to help you relax and prepare for your birth. In fact the more you listen to the guided relaxations and positive affirmations, the more familiar they will become and the more effective they will be at helping you relax when it comes to birth. Positive affirmations have been proven to change the way your mind works and listening regularly will help you feel less anxious and more confident in the lead up to birth. \n \nTHE SCIENCE\n\nWe know the more relaxed you are during birth, the more oxytocin you will produce. Oxytocin helps your uterus to work efficiently, making labour faster and more comfortable. \n \nLIFESKILLS\n\nYou can also use Freya post-birth any time you feel you could benefit from taking some deep breaths or need some help finding your zen. Everything you learn through using Freya - mindfulness exercises, breathing techniques, the benefits of taking time out - are skills for life.\n\nIf you have any questions or spot any pesky bugs lurking about the place (!) please do let us know at help@thepositivebirthcompany.co.uk\n\nWHAT YOU’LL GET:\n\niPhone and Apple Watch app\nA timer to record your surges (also known as a contraction timer)\nCoaching audio to keep your mind focused on breathing through each surge\nA gentle expanding visualisation which you can use to sync your breathing\nA detailed log of your surges over time, so you can track your progress through labour\nAbility to easily share the log with your birth partner, midwife or doula\nGuided relaxations, positive affirmations and soothing visuals to help keep you calm and relaxed, making birth easier, quicker and more straightforward (can also be used in pregnancy and postnatally)\nCoaching created by renowned hypnobirthing expert Siobhan Miller, founder of The Positive Birth Company\n\nDownload the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the App Store and prepare to meet your baby in the best possible way, feeling calm and confident, relaxed and happy!"

      "label": "Blood calcium, vitamin D, and osteoporosis are important health issues. The consequences of abnormal levels are often life-changing and occasionally life-threatening. Using this app is the equivalent to spending hours with the world’s most experienced doctors teaching you about your calcium, parathyroid, osteoporosis, and vitamin D issues. Your tests results are analyzed to determine if a problem exists, what risks are associated, and what to do about it. Beautiful graphs make understanding these problems simple!\n\nBlood tests and bone density scans can be difficult to interpret—even many doctors do not diagnose calcium, vitamin D, and parathyroid problems correctly or timely. Hyperparathyroidism is a disease that affects 1 in 800 people and 1 in 250 women over 50 and is very often overlooked while patients suffer from chronic fatigue, memory loss, depression, osteoporosis, bone pain and many other symptoms. Calcium Pro is a powerful software program that will analyze your calcium health and provide you guidance about the status of your bones, kidneys, parathyroid glands, vitamin D, and other related health issues.\n\nYou start by entering your test results for calcium, parathyroid hormone, and vitamin D. Then we look at your bone density (osteoporosis levels). CalciumPro will analyze and graph your tests making them easy to understand. It will let you know the status of your parathyroid glands and your chance of having hyperparathyroidism. Suggested next steps are given. Tracking tools will show your calcium and vitamin D levels over time, and will show if your bones are losing density (worsening osteoporosis), or gaining bone density. There are important learning tools on every page, and an extensive video and reading library at the end. The app will provide guidance about talking to your physician regarding the possible need for surgery and other important steps.\n\nA Risk Assessment Tool shows your relative risk for conditions associated with high blood calcium: Osteoporosis, Heart Disease, Heart Arrhythmias and Palpitations, High Blood Pressure, Kidney Stones and Kidney Failure, GERD, several Cancers, and others. Watch your risk assessment graphs change as you address your calcium problems. \n\nThis app was developed by doctors at the Norman Parathyroid Center, the world’s leading parathyroid and calcium treatment center using over 4,000,000 data points from over 30,000 patients. Let the world’s leading doctors help you understand these problems so you and your doctor can make important, informed decisions. Take control of your own health!"

All questions have been revised and updated to provide for the best learning experience.\n\nTopical review tests include sections on Airway, Cardiology, Medical, Trauma, Operations, OB & Pediatrics. All review tests include a detailed written rationale to help you better understand the answer and how to interpret an NREMT style question.\n\nOnce you are ready to test your readiness and challenge your stamina, move on to the two simulated 120-question NREMT exams in the test section.\n\nStill the tough, high-quality questions you have come to expect from Bill Brown, former executive director of the NREMT, the redesigned EMT PASS will prepare you like no other for passing your certification exam."

Create a Favorites list, and search and filter it similarly.\n\nThe best mnemonics can be those you make yourself. Add your own mnemonics to the database, where they'll appear seamlessly alongside those which come with the program.  Submit them instantaneously to the Medical Mnemonics server for review by an MD (that's me!) and inclusion in the next version.\n\nYou can email any mnemonic to a colleague from within Medical Mnemonics. He or she can view it within the email or add it to their own copy of Medical Mnemonics with a single click.\n\nUpdates will be free for life and will include new mnemonics submitted by users (that's you!) and added as we all continue learning together.\n\nEvery mnemonic is physician-reviewed, but we're only human.

      "label": "Do your children often have a fever? Do you sometimes get confused remembering when exactly it started, how it progressed and what other symptoms occurred? Having trouble explaining the exact course of the fever to the pediatrician? Keep track of body temperatures and medication for your whole family with Feevy.\n\n\nTEMPERATURE, MEDICATION AND NOTES\nWith Feevy you can not only record temperature measurements, but also track medications and enter text notes. This way, you can verify if medication was effective and capture additional information, e.g. regarding the patient’s condition. Be perfectly prepared for your next visit to the doctor!\n\nBEAUTIFUL CHARTS\nEntering data is worthless if you can’t analyze it later. Feevy comes with a beautiful and very detailed interactive chart, which makes it easy to get a quick overview, as well as to analyze temperature curves in more detail. You can freely zoom and pan it to see all the details you need.\n\nPRINT AND SHARE YOUR DATA\nOf course you can also print and export your data. This way you can bring your fever curve with you to the doctor or even send it via e-mail. The PDF contains all measurements, medications and notes, as well as a full-page chart showing the temperature curve.\n\nTRACK MULTIPLE PEOPLE\nFeevy lets you track the fever curves for multiple people. It is perfect for keeping track of your children's conditions and illnesses. To represent your family with some personality, Feevy comes with a set of cute profile icons to choose from.\n\nSYNC WITH FAMILY MEMBERS\nEspecially if you use Feevy to track your kids' illnesses, you will appreciate its sync functionality. No matter who measures the temperature or administers medication, both parents will always see the same data on their devices.\n\nUNIVERSAL APP\nFeevy supports both iPhone and iPad, including iPad multitasking (Slide Over and Split View). Use your iPhone while on the go or to quickly enter a new measurement, and use the iPad to have a detailed look at the charts.\n\n\nFeedback is always welcome: feedback@feevyapp.com or via Twitter @feevyapp.\n\n\nIMPORTANT\nIn case of fever and sickness, please always consult your doctor. Using this app to track body temperature and symptoms is not a substitute for a visit to the doctor!\n\nOF COURSE YOU CANNOT MEASURE YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE WITH THIS APP! You can only record, visualize and archive the measurements obtained with a fever thermometer."

      "label": "Squeezy has helped thousands of women regain confidence in their pelvic floor. Pelvic health specialists around the world recommend Squeezy to their patients every day because it works.\n\nAround 30,000 people use Squeezy regularly to help them remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises. So if you are thinking about downloading Squeezy for your pelvic floor, you are not alone. \n\nAll women should be doing these exercises and some will be doing them as part of a physiotherapy programme.\n\nSqueezy is simple to use, informative and designed to help women to remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises (also known as Kegel exercises). \n\nFeatures includes:\n• A pre-set exercise plan that follows public health guidelines\n• A record of the number of exercises you have completed, compared to your target\n• Visual and audio guides for exercises\n• Exercise reminders with customisable settings\n• Educational information about the pelvic floor\n• “Professional mode” – if working with a pelvic health specialist, you can tailor the exercise plan to fit your needs\n• A bladder diary to keep track of your symptoms, if required\n• Simple and clear interface\n\nSqueezy has been clinically reviewed and approved by the NHS for its clinical safety, and is compliant with NHS Information Governance requirements.\n\nSqueezy won several industry awards including ehi Awards 2016, Health Innovation Network 2016, National Continence Care Awards 2015/16 and was a finalist for awards including Advancing Healthcare Awards 2014 and 2017, Abbvie Sustainable Healthcare Awards 2016.\n\nFor more about Squeezy and additional pelvic health information visit squeezyapp.com.\n\n*Apple Watch users*\nDuring your exercises you need to hold your finger on your Apple Watch face to keep it live and running. The play button changes to state ‘Hold’ when running an exercise.\n\nThis keeps your Watch from dozing off while your attention is focused on your pelvic floor. Most Watch screens go to sleep after 7 or 15 seconds (time dependent on your Watch settings). Squeezy has no control over the screen sleep time on the Watch; it has to obey your Watch settings. \n\nWe hope to be able to improve the Watch experience in future. In the meantime, we’re continuing the existing Watch support because many people find it helpful.\n\nIf you have feedback on the Apple Watch, please get in touch with the developers directly on help@squeezyapp.com.\n\n\nThis app has been translated into Saudi Arabian Arabic.\nتمت ترجمه هذا التطبيق الى اللغه العربيه ( المملكه العربيه السعوديه)‏"

This app will test your ability to identify electrocardiogram rhythms. Recognition of ECG rhythms as the wave forms sweep across a monitor screen is a different skill than diagnosing cardiac rhythms on a static tracing. This app will evaluate your resuscitation skills better than reviewing with a book because you have to diagnose the rhythms as they dynamically move across the screen.\n\nThe app utilizes an organized four Criteria approach to identify the rhythms. You can also study the Description of the rhythm to review the electrophysiology. Use the same process to test yourself and review all the ECG rhythms.\n\nWhen you feel you have mastered the rhythms in this program you should review the American Heart Association Advanced Cardiac Life Support algorithms using the app Anesoft 'ACLS Sim 2016'."

Why not be able to choose based on how you are holding the phone and what else you are doing at the same time?\n    • Use the numeric entry pad (0 3 3 0 2 0 0 8) and immediately see the results, OR\n    • Spin the date wheel at the bottom of the screen and tap Next.\n\n 3) Thorough results: All the information you would expect from a classic wheel, plus more:\n   • Estimated Due Date\n   • LMP Date\n   • Conception Date\n   • 1st Trimester End Date\n   • 2nd Trimester End Date\n   • Gestational Age\n   • Conceptional Age\n   • Expected Fetal Length based on standard fetal growth curves\n   • Expected Fetal Weight based on standard fetal growth curves (\"How much does my baby weigh, doctor?\")\n\nResults are relative to 'today' by default; this can be quickly changed to reflect any date by tapping the 'today' button and selecting a new date.\n\n 4) Accurate results: Perfect OB Wheel provides exact dates and accounts for all calendar variance, including leap years. \n\n 5) Persistence: Perfect OB Wheel remembers the date and date type you last used and restores them when launched to streamline your workflow.\n\n 6) Perfect OB Tracker upgrade: Available as an in-app purchase update, the Perfect OB Tracker lets you track any number of pregnancies, with at-a-glance due date and gestational age and one-tap access to all the data Perfect OB Wheel provides.  A  picture and text notes can be kept on each patient. Postpartum tracking is also available. Passcode locking is available for HIPAA compliance."

      "label": "EMT Academy is a thorough training guide and practice exam for EMT-Basic level EMS personnel. Pass your NREMT certification exam with flying colors, or keep your skills sharp long after you become certified. Written in the style of the NREMT certification exam using scenario-based questions based on current and latest EMS material. \n\nThere are flashcards, and there are flashcards. We’ve been at this since the Palm Pilot! Here are some advanced features that we provide, that set us apart from the competition:\n\n—Questions are revised and updated multiple times per year; you can easily email a question to us for an explanation or comment\n—Search for keywords to review a particular topic\n—Some cards include full color illustrations; most include explanations when helpful\n—Universal app that supports iPhone and iPads, screen rotation, and all the things you expect, including the iPhone 6's\n—Cards can be bookmarked for quick access later\n—You can go back and just look at the questions you missed\n—Advanced score tracking keeps track of your progress daily, weekly, and monthly\n—GAME CENTER support so you can play with friends, compete on leaderboards, and earn achievements\n—There are no in-app purchases required to unlock the “real” app\n\nNOTE: Some people post reviews (instead of emailing us) saying that our CPR is out of date because we mention \"ABC\". Our CPR guidelines clearly follow CAB. However, it's entirely appropriate to use the expression \"check the ABC's\" during assessment and this is widely used in EMS. It has nothing to do with the CPR sequence if that becomes necessary.\n\nWe believe in quality over quantity, yet we still provide OVER 1000 QUALITY MULTIPLE CHOICE QUESTIONS for EMT, with explanations, divided into these chapters:\n\n--PREPARATORY--\nEMS Systems\nSafety & Wellness\nLegal & Ethical Issues\nCommunications\nDocumentation\nThe Human Body\nLifting & Moving\n\n--ASSESSMENT--\nVitals & SAMPLE\nPatient Assessment\n\n--AIRWAY--\n\n--MEDICAL--\nGeneral Pharmacology\nRespiratory Emergencies\nCardiovascular Emergencies\nNeurologic Emergencies\nAcute Abdominal Pain\nDiabetes & AMS\nAllergic Reactions\nToxicology\nBehavioral Emergencies\n\n--TRAUMA--\nTrauma Overview\nBleeding & Shock\nSoft Tissue Injuries\nFace & Neck Injuries\nHead & Spine Injuries\nChest Injuries\nAbdominal Injuries\nMusculoskeletal Injuries\nEnvironmental Emergencies\n\n--SPECIAL POPULATIONS--\nObstetrics & Neonatal\nPediatrics\nGeriatrics\n\n--EMS OPERATIONS--\nTransport Operations\nExtrication & Rescue\nIncident Management\nTerrorism & Disasters\n\n—BLS RESUSCITATION--\n\n--ALS TECHNIQUES--\nAdvanced Airway\n\nTrack your scores and progress along the way. We also provide over 300 \"electronic flashcards\" for another method of learning. \n\nTHAT'S OVER 1300 EMT QUESTIONS! But that's not all. We also include the EMS Toolkit, which many people find just as valuable as the practice questions. Here's what you get in the EMS Toolkit:\n\n• EMS Scenarios - Practice in pairs or small groups with these step by step, ready made scenarios.\n\n• CPR Reference - Updated for latest AHA guidelines using CAB, we provide a reference to the proper steps in CPR, test questions to prepare you for your annual recert, and even a audio metronome that tells you the proper cadence for compressions.\n\n• NREMT Testing Tips - A summary of what you should know before taking the NREMT exam.\n\n• Documentation Guide - Things to consider and document for most common emergencies. Also, a quick reference to those acronyms like OQPRST and DCAP/BTLS.\n\n• NREMT-B Psychomotor Skills Exam - Practical exam checklists for common EMT-B skills so you can make sure you perform every step properly, exactly as spelled out by NREMT.\n\n• EMT-B Skills Guides - We've also added \"how-to\" guides on how to perform key EMT skills like taking Blood Pressure and using an EpiPen.\n\n• NREMT-B Recertification - This tells you what you need to do to recert (number of hours, categories, etc.)"

Physical Therapist Assistant Content Master is designed to assist physical therapist assistants to possess full command of core academic content. Physical Therapist Assistant Content Master is an ideal tool for physical therapist assistant students, recent physical therapist assistant graduates, and licensed physical therapist assistants.\n\nThe academic content is organized into unique system and non-system categories. \n\nMusculoskeletal System\nNeuromuscular System\nCardiopulmonary System\nOther Systems\nEquipment and Devices\nTherapeutic Modalities\nSafety and Protection\nProfessional Responsibilities\nResearch\n\nPhysical therapist assistants can review selected content by scrolling through subcategories in each of the system and non-system areas. Our innovative design presents academic content in a user-friendly format that allows users to easily digest essential information. Users rate their competence in a variety of topics and create personalized Study Stacks. Study Stacks allow users to efficiently remediate identified academic deficiencies. Frequent review of essential academic content allows users to successfully convert the information to long-term memory. \n\nPhysical Therapist Assistant Content Master includes an assessment mode that consists of 600 multiple-choice questions. Each multiple-choice question has four unique options and an explanation supporting the correct answer. The multiple-choice questions are designed to assess a user’s mastery of the information presented in the content review mode. The number of questions in each category varies from a minimum of 25 to a maximum of 125. Our Content Tag feature allows users to quickly review questions by topic area (i.e., special tests, cranial nerves, pulmonary function tests). \n\nA formal score report describes a physical therapist assistant’s level of mastery cumulatively, by category, and by timeline. Each of the individual reports provides users with valuable performance data to assess their present level of academic mastery. Utilization of the app on a frequent basis considerably strengthens a physical therapist assistant’s knowledge base and provides the necessary foundation to progress to higher level licensing-like questions. \n\nCompany Information\nScorebuilders is a physical therapist owned company whose sole focus is to prepare students for the National Physical Therapy Examinations. We sell more review products and offer more review courses than any other company. Scorebuilders has experienced three decades of continuous growth and is the recognized leader in physical therapy licensing preparation. Scorebuilders offers candidates the knowledge and insight necessary to achieve their goal of becoming a licensed physical therapist assistant on the first attempt.\n\nCopyright © 2019 Scorebuilders\n\nPhysical Therapist Assistant Content Master is the exclusive property of Scorebuilders.

Also, the COMPLETE guidelines are embedded so you can educate yourself even without Internet access.\n\nOur version of the guidelines has been one of the first apps for any provider who diagnoses and treats STIs to buy, including residents, midwives, and nurses. This app was designed and developed by a board-certified Obstetrician/Gynecologist who understands how to quickly answer your questions about STI treatments.\n\nSTI 2021 contains the CDC STI Treatment Guidelines with the original, but difficult to navigate, table of contents. So, we have also provided a more clinician-friendly organization of these same guidelines so that clinicians can find conditions and their treatments much faster. STD 2021 also contains a glossary, literature references, as well as the guidelines, pocket guides in PDF formats.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This adaptation is meant ONLY for adults who are licensed healthcare professionals.

Strengthening this essential skill can improve reading, concentration, memory, attention to detail, and speed of processing. \n\nTWO POWERFUL MODES help brain injury and stroke survivors with left neglect improve at home while also helping occupational therapy (OT) and speech therapy (SLP) professionals to efficiently assess for right or left neglect and provide more effective treatment.\n\n* Use the Test mode to determine if and where a visual attention deficit exists.\n* Use the Practice mode to train scanning by finding targets in order.\n\n++ SEE HOW IT CAN HELP – Download Visual Attention Therapy Lite for FREE! ++\n\n-----------\n\nCANCELLATION TASKS JUST GOT BETTER. This professional cognitive training app takes a familiar format for treating left neglect and transforms it into a dynamic, interactive tool for all ages. Visual Attention Therapy offers benefits that can only be achieved through technology: \n\n* Targets must be tapped from left to right, top to bottom in Practice mode, which trains users to slow down and scan the entire screen before they move on.\n* Immediate feedback with visual and auditory cues keeps users engaged.\n* Timed exercises increase motivation to work quickly and accurately.\n* Stop wasting time counting errors! Automated scoring includes data for accuracy by quadrant, time for completion, and mistakes in professional e-mailed reports.\n* Adjustable layouts and 10 levels of difficulty allow you to customize the experience to meet changing needs or multiple users.\n* Sidebar signal can flash in a variety of colors to draw attention to the left or right.\n* An endless variety of combinations eliminates the need to photocopy exercises, with the option to print screenshots when you need a traditional exercise.\n* Use only one target to focus on scanning, or use two targets at once to challenge users with working memory and alternating attention deficits. \n\n-----------\n\nRACE AGAINST THE CLOCK to improve scores while improving cognitive and reading skills. Levels featuring letters can support literacy goals, while symbol-based levels challenge visual memory skills. It’s an occupational therapy dream come true!\n\nVisual Attention Therapy was developed by a certified Speech-Language Pathologist (SLP) and is used worldwide in speech and occupational therapy (OT) to help adults with left neglect after stroke and brain injury. It is also used with children with dyslexia and attentional deficits by reading specialists and neuropsychologists.\n\nDON’T JUST TELL YOUR PATIENTS TO LOOK TO THE LEFT – TRAIN THEM. Modernize your occupational therapy or speech therapy exercises with a left neglect training tool that improves stroke and brain injury rehab. \n\nDOWNLOAD IT NOW!\n\n-----------\n\nLooking for something different in a stroke therapy app?

We’ve taken all the content from our original Pedi STAT application and carefully selected components that are unique to providers in EMS.  We’ve solicited feedback from leaders in out of hospital care, including paramedics, EMTs, air medical flight crews, and medical directors. We’ve condensed the content to be applicable to those providing care outside the hospital, including first responders, firefighters, EMTs, Paramedics, and Critical Care Transport providers.\n\nMedication dosing and pediatric equipment sizes are easily and rapidly accessed, and accurately calculated based on provider input of either weight, length, age, or Broselow / Pediatape weight estimates.  We are attempting to eliminate medical errors by calculating not only the correct pediatric medication dose, but also the volume to be administered for patient specific conditions.  We have also included algorithms and medical calculators to assist providers in multiple areas, including managing pediatric cardiac arrest, burn size estimation and fluid resuscitation, and Glasgow Coma Scale.\n\nCaring for pediatric patients is associated with a large number of challenges, the most important being selecting the correct equipment and medications, and then dosing the medications correctly.  Our goal is to eliminate these challenges as much as possible, and allow the provider to concentrate on what is most important, the patient.\n\nSuggestions for improvements or additions are always welcome:  Pedi-STAT.com"

It will help you receive more money every month from the VA for your injuries and help you document your injuries and treatment.\n\nThis app is not just a calculator, it will tell you what information you need to provide (based on your selected injuries/diagnoses) and allow you to document and save the information in order to receive the most compensation for your injuries and illnesses.  It allows you to document your injuries, symptoms, doctor visits, episodes and medications.  It helps you save and organize the information in a secure encrypted database. When you are ready for your VA interview, email all of your injuries with your documentation to yourself or the VA.  If you don't provide documentation to the VA, you may not receive the full compensation for your injuries or illnesses.  It works completely offline, without an internet connection.\n\nThe VA will rely on YOU to provide them with all of the medical information that is pertinent to the injury you are claiming.  They cannot not look through your medical records for you.\n\n** Active duty personnel - Download it before you deploy!\n\n**  Use it to track injuries, and care given for you or your battle buddy.  Everything in the app is self contained so it works when you are not connected to the internet.\n\n** Veterans - My VA Benefits tells you how get a copy of your medical records from the Department of Defense (DoD) and the VA.  It also helps you request your medical records using the Freedom Of Information Act (FOIA).\n\n** If you cannot find your diagnosis, let us know and we will research if for you.  Just submit your question to our forum at our website: http://myvabenefits.us/\n\n**Submit questions to our forum: http://myvabenefits.us/index.php/forum/index \n\n** We provide free updates for the app with the latest codes and rate tables when the VA releases them.\n\n** If you encounter an issue with the app, do not uninstall it or you may lose your data.  Just contact us at http://myvabenefits.us and we will fix it.\n\n** For Back injuries see code 5320 or search for \"spine\".\n\n** For Hearing loss, you cannot self-diagnose because \"An examination for hearing impairment for VA purposes must be conducted by a state-licensed audiologist and must include a controlled speech discrimination test (Maryland CNC) and a puretone audiometry test. Examinations will be conducted without the use of hearing aids.\""

They may be unsafe when they forget to use a walker or apply the wheelchair breaks before standing. All of these facts and procedures can be engrained into memory using a repetitive and effective memory training procedure.\n\nThis Spaced Retrieval Therapy app uses the scientifically-proven method of spaced retrieval training to help people with dementia or other memory impairments to recall important information. Recalling an answer over multiplying intervals of time, such as 1 minute, 2 minutes, 8 minutes, and so on, helps to cement the information in memory.\n\nSpaced Retrieval Therapy is an enhanced interval timer with independent data tracking and prompts. It automatically increases the time between prompts with correct responses and decreases it with incorrect ones. This app will help clinicians, family members, and students keep track of the intervals and performance as they practice up to 3 memory targets.\n\n*Put away your stopwatch and paper - this app is all you need!\n\n*Keeps track of expanding intervals and data so you don't have to\n\n*Works in the background while doing other therapy exercises or using other apps\n\n*Subtle sound and visual prompts let you know it’s time to ask again\n\n*Tracks accuracy and data automatically, & emails you the finished report\n\n\n\"5 Stars - This app is a fantastic inclusion into my therapy toolbox. It is very useful in therapy and helps me keep track patient progress more efficiently.\" - App Store Review\n\n\nSpeech-Language Pathologists, Occupational Therapists, Neuropsychologists, Teachers, Social Workers, and families can all use this simple technique & app to help clients and loved ones remember important information (names, safety procedures, orientation information, etc).\n\nRecommended by top experts in memory training and dementia therapy, Spaced Retrieval Therapy will make your life easier and your therapy more efficient.\n\n\n\"***** Very Useful!  I found this app to be extremely useful during therapy sessions. When juggling multiple activities it can be difficult to remember to cue a patient for each specific interval. This app makes spaced retrieval an easy way to incorporate prospective and short term memory tasks into treatment.\" - SLP on App Store Review\n\n\nVisit our website at http://tactustherapy.com/app/srt/ to link to several articles about this technique and its proven efficacy with dementia, aphasia, normal learners, and more. \n\n\nThis app is also available as part of the Tactus Complete Therapy Toolkit and Tactus Cognitive Therapy Toolkit discount bundles for iPad users.\n\n\nPlease note: This app is a timer and tracks data.  Targets should be individually selected for the memory-impaired person to be relevant and meaningful.  This app is not intended to be used alone by the memory-impaired person, but as a therapy tool by a clinician or family member trained in this technique."

      "label": "Designed by a pediatrician, BiliCalc uses the American Academy of Pediatrics 2004 \"Management of Hyperbilirubinemia in Infants Greater than 35 Weeks of Age\" to calculate the threshold for starting phototherapy based on the patient's age, bilirubin level, and neurotoxicity risk. Values are now displayed on the phototherapy nomogram. In addition, it will also tell you the patient's risk zone using the Bhutani Nomogram.\n\nAllows direct age input and includes the option to calculate age from birth and lab sample times. The app has a direct link to source journal articles, nomograms, and a list of the neurotoxicity risk factors. Supports US and SI units (mg/dL and µmol/L).\n\nApp Feature Summary\n-Calculates phototherapy threshold for newborns 35 weeks and older\n-Displays values on phototherapy nomogram\n-Suggests time frame for followup bilirubin levels based on patient risk zone \n-Direct links to reference journal articles\n\n**********************************\nFrequently Asked Questions\n**********************************\n1. I think the graph is backwards. Why is low risk on top and high risk on bottom?\n\nThe graph is directly from the 2004 AAP Hyperbilirubinemia Guidelines. The degree of \"risk\" refers to the infant's risk for developing neurotoxicity. This is different than the Bhutani Nomogram in which \"risk\" refers to the risk for development of severe hyperbilirubinemia. The threshold for treatment (when a data point lies above one of the lines on the graph) of the infant is different based on the predisposing factors (divided into the three risk categories). Babies who are \"low neurotoxicity risk,\" can tolerate higher levels of bilirubin than a baby with medium or high risk. Therefore, a high risk baby will be treated at lower bilirubin levels than a low risk baby. The graph is correct in having low risk on top since a higher value is needed to pass the threshold for treatment (phototherapy). Please see the graph here for verification as well: http://bit.ly/AppPWU. Please email if you have further questions.\n\n******************************************\nIntended for use by pediatricians, neonatologists, physicians, medical students, and pediatric nurses who treat newborn infants in the hospital and as outpatients.\n\nBiliCalc should be used only as a reference aid. The information contained in the app should not be used as a substitute for the exercise of professional clinical judgement.

See which side you last fed on.\n+ Bottle - record amount as well as time feeding, and if it’s formula or EBM. \n+ Pumping - record amounts and time for each side, or just record totals if you prefer\n+ Sleep - record time, and easily adjust start and end-times as you need\n+ Diaper - record wet, dirty or both\n+ Night mode provides a low-contrast background and can be easily switched on or off\n+ Simultaneous timer support  - e.g. sleep and feeding - we know both can happen at once!\n+ Manually add activities later if you forgot, or edit existing ones even if they’re running - e.g. if you forgot to start the sleep timer when putting baby down, just start the timer and adjust the start time earlier and the timer will automatically update. \n+ Add notes to activities, for example where you fed or whether baby was settled. You can even add notes while the timer is running  - you don’t need to wait for it to finish.\n+ Statistics - detailed stats including totals, averages per day, average length and interval. For nursing there is a breakdown for left and right sides, and for diapers a wet and dirty breakdown.\n+ Switch activities on or off so your interface isn’t cluttered with activities you don’t use\n+ Support for tracking twins or for your other little ones all from the one app. You can switch babies with a single swipe.\n+ Supports optimal layout for iPhone4s through to iPhone 7 Plus \n+ Data backed up automatically and securely   \n+ Get a full CSV export activities by contacting support\n+ Responsive and caring support -  we really want you to help you\n+ It’s all there - no extra purchases required to unlock features\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions we would love to hear from you - please contact us at help@babytimeapp.com or visit our community at http://help.babytimeapp.com.\n \nDownload BabyTime now for a completely new baby tracking experience."

It is fast and reliable, and won’t be affected by working a long shift!\n\nData entry is kept the a minimum so there is no excuse for failing to double-check drug doses before administering them.\n\nThe app can be configured to suit the needs of your working environment. The concentrations in the suspensions and critical care sections can edited and concentrations stored for future use. The default units for each data item can be set to match you needs.\n\nWhy is Dose Chex required? Errors in the administration of medications are commonplace and can result in significant harm to patients. The 2009 NPSA report ‘Safety in Doses’ identified 72,482 medication incident reports in one year. Of these 100 had resulted in death or severe harm. In addition, such errors can have a significant effect on the person administering the medication\n\nIn acute care settings there can be many distractions, making it difficult to concentrate on the often complex calculations required when administering medicines. Removing as many potential points of human error helps make the process safer."

At that time, the treating team is away and you're on call, running all over the hospital.  \n\nMD on Call gives you tips on how to QUICKLY assess and manage (acutely) common problems so you can go on assessing the next patient, or to your room to get some well deserved sleep.  -- it is NOT meant to replace a textbook --\n \n\n\nFEATURES\nMD on call is divided into 5 main sections:\n\n• Issues •  26 frequent on call situations (including management of some specific conditions)\n\nAbdominal Pain*\nAcute Coronary Syndrome*\nAgitation / Violence\nAnaphylaxis\nBleeding\nBradycardia*\nChest Pain\nConstipation\nDeath (Pronouncing)\nDecreased LOC\nDysuria / UTI*\nDyspnea\nFever\nFebrile neutropenia\nHeadache\nHypertension\nHypotension\nInsomnia\nMeningitis\nNausea / Vomiting\nPain\nPalliation\nPneumonia\nSeizure\nTachycardia\nWound Dehiscence\nWound Infection\n\n• Labs •  Common electrolytes abnormalities (including management)\n\nHypo Ca, K, Mg, Na, PO4, glycemia\nHyper Ca, K, Na, glycemia\n\n• ECG •  Normal and abnormal ECG values, now with examples\n\n• Misc •  Suggestions on how to write orders for admission, \"comfort measures only\", \"on call\" notes, OR and procedure notes.  \nTransfusions:  general information and common reactions\nMisc:  CSF values, opioid conversion...\n\n• Lines and Tubes • How to manage common problems, such as a blocked NG tube.\n\n• Search •  Search using acronyms or keywords\n\n\n****************\n\nFeedback is more than welcome :  visit the website for more details\n\n**************** \n\n\nDISCLAIMER\n\nThis publication (application) is to be used as a guide only.

      "label": "SRR Counter for Dogs and Cats\n\nCount your pet’s heart rate while they are sleeping. It is a must have if your dog or cat has a heart condition and your vet recommends you track their heart rate on a regular basis.\n\nEASY TO USE\n\nWith the SRR Counter for Dogs and Cats app, you can easily count your pet’s breathing rate for 15 seconds, 30 seconds or 60 seconds. When your pet exhales, tap the Breath button to start the timer. Continue to tap the Breath button each time your pet exhales. Once complete, the number of breaths will display.\n\nCALCULATIONS\n– If you select 15 Seconds, the app will calculate each time you tap times 4.\n\n– If you select 30 Seconds, the app will calculate each time you tap times 2.\n\n– If you select 60 Seconds, the app will display the number of times you tap.\n\nFEATURES\n– The Apple Watch will provide haptic feedback with each tap. This allows you to watch your pet breathing, rather than your watch.\n\n– You will receive a haptic notification when the timer is finished and be presented with the total breath count.\n\n– No audible feedback so you won’t disturb your precious pet at rest! Please set the Apple Watch to silent to fully utilize this feature.\n\nMY STORY\n\nI created this app when my rescue dog, Bizou, went into heart failure at age 13 and was diagnosed with a grade 5 heart murmur. She was on several medications and my vet recommended I begin tracking her breathing to help them in regulating the dosages of her medications. I found it difficult for just 1 person to watch her breathing while also watching a timer to know when to stop counting. My goal was to make this much easier.\n\nDISCLAIMER\n\nContact your veterinarian for normal and elevated heart rates for both cats and dogs. If your pet has an elevated heart rate or you have any concerns about his or her health, please immediately contact your vet.\n\nFEEDBACK\n\nPlease send your feedback to support@verkadesg.com. I would love to implement new features based on your ideas!\n\nSee more information at www.verkadesg.com\n\nAll proceeds go to the Humane Society of York County http://humanesocietyofyorkcounty.org"

      "label": "The Airway Triage App can be used by all health care professionals in any clinical situation in which airway management is needed.\nWith the easy to use PHASE and HELP-ET checklists the airway of your patient can be triaged within minutes into basic or advanced. This is the best airway assessment tool to clearly define basic airways that can be managed with basic airway management techniques by a trained person. Advanced airways should be managed by medical personnel with advanced airways skills and special equipment may be needed.  Complexity factors that may make airway management very challenging can be found and used to make an airway management plan. This is the first airway assessment tool that implements human factors, vital signs and the surgical procedure. The app can be used in pre-assessment clinics, in the operating room environment, in the ICU and emergency department for patients > 12 years old or prior to procedural sedation.\nWith the Circles of Life airway approach you can check  if you are “fit-to-fly with this patient for this airway management procedure”.\nThe Circles of Life approach can be used by trainees to evaluate the progress of skills and training and can also be used by experienced airway managers to seek help or assistance for specific highly complex procedures.\nThe Airway Triage App can also be used for prospective airway management studies. A direct link with description of your airway plan and an audit of adverse events can be emailed that will be used to validate this innovative triage tool. The Airway Triage App is developed by the founder of the Airway Management Academy.\nUse this airway assessment tool and please provide feedback to improve global patient safety during airway management.\nThis app is available in 10 languages, the default language is English."

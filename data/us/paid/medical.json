      "label": "Pregnant? This is for YOU!\nOur leading app allows you to use just your iPhone microphone to record and share your baby’s sounds. It is the best-in-class, has excellent reviews, is super simple and safe to use. Now supports Apple Airpods and Bluetooth Headphones.\n\n\"It took some time and patience... thank you for creating this cheap, awesome technology to use at home.\" - Niki\n\nCategory #1 in the USA and 102 other countries. Here's why...\n\nDeveloped by parents like you (with expertise in sound engineering and app development) who wanted a trustworthy, safe and easy-to-use way to record our baby's fetal sounds (kicks, heartbeat etc.) - and keep a record of a quality that we hadn't been able to find before in other apps. It has been extensively tested on expectant mothers.\n\n\"I was skeptical at first. Great app! Worth it.\" - Legretta \n\n**** But honestly, does it actually work?? ****\nYes. We've sound-engineered ways to attempt to isolate the baby's heart beat, sounds (kicks, heart beat and more) and using an advanced algorithm, amplify them making them easier to detect and hear.\n\nNOTE: It takes time, technique and patience and depends on the position and number of weeks of your baby so you'll need to stick with it. When you do, our results are excellent. Results are best between 27-40 weeks as your baby is bigger and stronger. \n\nWe constantly improve our extensive tutorial and techniques to handhold you through - we even have a support group on Facebook so you can get help.\n\nWe want you to be happy with Hear My Baby heartbeat and getting results can sometimes be difficult.  If you are struggling (can't find your own heartbeat etc. DO contact us via support. We want to help you!\n\nGIFT THIS APP: Click the “Buy App” arrow on the iTunes® App Store\n\n\nFAQs\n\n**** No Accessories Required ****\nWe use the internal microphone from your phone to attempt to listen and record your fetal sound. We recommend Bluetooth Headphones for best results.\n\n**** How It Works ****\n1. Hear My Baby, has been precisely engineered to listen to abdominal sounds, then record and amplify them. Listen to your own heartbeat first to confirm the app is set up correctly. \n2. It works best when baby is head down and their back is facing forwards.\n3. Remove the case, be in a very quiet room and focus on your lower abdomen. Listen then Tap record.\n4. Our simple recording management helps you to keep a record of your special moment\n5. Take a selfie if you wish and share \n6. We'll walk you through exactly how to get the best baby heartbeat results.\n\n**** Easy Share Feature ****\nSharing is awesome you can opt to share via Facebook, Whats App, Instagram or email.\n\n**** We Care About Your Privacy ****\nWe take your privacy and special moment seriously. You decide who sees or hears it and can delete it at any time.\n\n**** Before you start... ****\nYou DO need to carefully follow the instructions for Hear My Baby to work. A quiet room is critical for results as the mic is super sensitive.   HMB doesn't fake the baby heartbeat or other fetal sounds :) \n\nPlease Note: results are normally superb, however the recording may not work if your placenta is at the front of the tummy or the baby is in the wrong position.\n\n**** Supported Phones ****\n13,12, X, Xs, 11, 11 Pro, 8, 7, 7+, SE, 6s, 6s+, 6, 6+ 5c, 5s & 5. We don't support iPad.\n\n**** Worried about safety? We are too! ***\nHMB is safe but to be extra sure DO switch your iPhone to airplane mode. This is a precaution and automatically stops all cellular transmissions.\n\n**** Is it a substitute for medical devices/support? ****\nNo - under no circumstances is HMB a substitute for medical support - if you don't get a result it doesn't mean anything is wrong :) Consult your doctor for any advice. We are NOT approved by the FDA. This is not a medical device and is not a medical baby heartbeat monitor. It is for FUN.\n\nPlease do check our T&Cs before downloading.\n\nFor results examples: www.facebook.com/hearmybaby\nwww.instagram.com/hearmybabyapp"

The Diary will also guide you through step 2 of the diet - FODMAP reintroduction.\n- The ability to adjust units of measurement (metric or imperial) and activate colour blindness assistance."

The updated management guidelines aim to:\n • Allow for a more complete and precise estimation of risk\n • Provide more appropriate intervention for high-risk individuals (detect and treat more precancer)\n • Recommend less intervention for low-risk individuals (decrease testing and treatment that won’t prevent cancer and may cause reproductive harm)\n • Allow for the future addition of new risk modifiers and screening and management technologies\n\nSee https://www.asccp.org/UserGuide for tips on using the app."

Simply enter the known variable and the data is instantly calculated. \n\nDeveloped by an Emergency Physician, this app minimizes the risk of medical errors allowing the provider to spend more time caring for the patient, and less time looking up and calculating doses.  \n\nIt is a critical companion for any physician, nurse, paramedic, or medical trainee involved in the care of critically ill pediatric patients."

Using this app is the equivalent to spending hours with the world’s most experienced doctors teaching you about your calcium, parathyroid, osteoporosis, and vitamin D issues. Your tests results are analyzed to determine if a problem exists, what risks are associated, and what to do about it. Beautiful graphs make understanding these problems simple!\n\nBlood tests and bone density scans can be difficult to interpret—even many doctors do not diagnose calcium, vitamin D, and parathyroid problems correctly or timely. Hyperparathyroidism is a disease that affects 1 in 800 people and 1 in 250 women over 50 and is very often overlooked while patients suffer from chronic fatigue, memory loss, depression, osteoporosis, bone pain and many other symptoms. Calcium Pro is a powerful software program that will analyze your calcium health and provide you guidance about the status of your bones, kidneys, parathyroid glands, vitamin D, and other related health issues.\n\nYou start by entering your test results for calcium, parathyroid hormone, and vitamin D. Then we look at your bone density (osteoporosis levels). CalciumPro will analyze and graph your tests making them easy to understand. It will let you know the status of your parathyroid glands and your chance of having hyperparathyroidism. Suggested next steps are given. Tracking tools will show your calcium and vitamin D levels over time, and will show if your bones are losing density (worsening osteoporosis), or gaining bone density. There are important learning tools on every page, and an extensive video and reading library at the end. The app will provide guidance about talking to your physician regarding the possible need for surgery and other important steps.\n\nA Risk Assessment Tool shows your relative risk for conditions associated with high blood calcium: Osteoporosis, Heart Disease, Heart Arrhythmias and Palpitations, High Blood Pressure, Kidney Stones and Kidney Failure, GERD, several Cancers, and others. Watch your risk assessment graphs change as you address your calcium problems. \n\nThis app was developed by doctors at the Norman Parathyroid Center, the world’s leading parathyroid and calcium treatment center using over 4,000,000 data points from over 30,000 patients. Let the world’s leading doctors help you understand these problems so you and your doctor can make important, informed decisions. Take control of your own health!"

She will help you relax between surges with a mix of guided relaxations, positive affirmations, gentle music and calming visualisations. Freya makes it easy for you to keep track of your surges and you can visit the log at any point to see how frequently your surges are coming and how long they are lasting. Freya will also let you know when your labour is established and when it might be a good time to contact your midwife. You will never birth alone with Freya by your side.\n \nTRACK YOUR SURGES\n\nIn hypnobirthing we refer to contractions as surges, as a ‘surge’ more accurately describes the sensation you’ll experience when in labour. Freya is the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the app store, designed specifically with hypnobirthing mums in mind, but can be used by anyone.\n \nPREPARE FOR BIRTH\n\nYou can also use Freya in pregnancy to help you relax and prepare for your birth. In fact the more you listen to the guided relaxations and positive affirmations, the more familiar they will become and the more effective they will be at helping you relax when it comes to birth. Positive affirmations have been proven to change the way your mind works and listening regularly will help you feel less anxious and more confident in the lead up to birth. \n \nTHE SCIENCE\n\nWe know the more relaxed you are during birth, the more oxytocin you will produce. Oxytocin helps your uterus to work efficiently, making labour faster and more comfortable. \n \nLIFESKILLS\n\nYou can also use Freya post-birth any time you feel you could benefit from taking some deep breaths or need some help finding your zen. Everything you learn through using Freya - mindfulness exercises, breathing techniques, the benefits of taking time out - are skills for life.\n\nIf you have any questions or spot any pesky bugs lurking about the place (!) please do let us know at help@thepositivebirthcompany.co.uk\n\nWHAT YOU’LL GET:\n\niPhone and Apple Watch app\nA timer to record your surges (also known as a contraction timer)\nCoaching audio to keep your mind focused on breathing through each surge\nA gentle expanding visualisation which you can use to sync your breathing\nA detailed log of your surges over time, so you can track your progress through labour\nAbility to easily share the log with your birth partner, midwife or doula\nGuided relaxations, positive affirmations and soothing visuals to help keep you calm and relaxed, making birth easier, quicker and more straightforward (can also be used in pregnancy and postnatally)\nCoaching created by renowned hypnobirthing expert Siobhan Miller, founder of The Positive Birth Company\n\nDownload the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the App Store and prepare to meet your baby in the best possible way, feeling calm and confident, relaxed and happy!"

All questions have been revised and updated to provide for the best learning experience.\n\nTopical review tests include sections on Airway, Cardiology, Medical, Trauma, Operations, OB & Pediatrics. All review tests include a detailed written rationale to help you better understand the answer and how to interpret an NREMT style question.\n\nOnce you are ready to test your readiness and challenge your stamina, move on to the two simulated 120-question NREMT exams in the test section.\n\nStill the tough, high-quality questions you have come to expect from Bill Brown, former executive director of the NREMT, the redesigned EMT PASS will prepare you like no other for passing your certification exam."

Physical Therapist Content Master is designed to assist physical therapists to possess full command of core academic content. Physical Therapist Content Master is an ideal tool for physical therapist students, recent physical therapy graduates, and licensed physical therapists.\n\nThe academic content is organized into unique system and non-system categories. \n\nMusculoskeletal System\nNeuromuscular System\nCardiopulmonary System\nOther Systems\nEquipment and Devices\nTherapeutic Modalities\nSafety and Protection\nProfessional Responsibilities\nResearch\n\nPhysical therapists can review selected content by scrolling through subcategories in each of the system and non-system areas. Our innovative design presents academic content in a user-friendly format that allows users to easily digest essential information. Users rate their competence in a variety of topics and create personalized Study Stacks. Study Stacks allow users to efficiently remediate identified academic deficiencies. Frequent review of essential academic content allows users to successfully convert the information to long-term memory. \n\nPhysical Therapist Content Master includes an assessment mode that consists of 750 multiple-choice questions. Each multiple-choice question has four unique options and an explanation supporting the correct answer. The multiple-choice questions are designed to assess a user’s mastery of the information presented in the content review mode. The number of questions in each category varies from a minimum of 25 to a maximum of 175. Our Content Tag feature allows users to quickly review questions by topic area (i.e., special tests, cranial nerves, pulmonary function tests). \n\nA formal score report describes a physical therapist’s level of mastery cumulatively, by category, and by timeline. Each of the individual reports provides users with valuable performance data to assess their present level of academic mastery. Utilization of the app on a frequent basis considerably strengthens a physical therapist’s knowledge base and provides the necessary foundation to progress to higher level licensing-like questions. \n\nCompany Information\nScorebuilders is a physical therapist owned company whose sole focus is to prepare students for the National Physical Therapy Examinations. We sell more review products and offer more review courses than any other company. Scorebuilders has experienced three decades of continuous growth and is the recognized leader in physical therapy licensing preparation. Scorebuilders offers candidates the knowledge and insight necessary to achieve their goal of becoming a licensed physical therapist on the first attempt.\n\nCopyright © 2019 Scorebuilders\n\nPhysical Therapist Content Master is the exclusive property of Scorebuilders.

      "label": "Bilateral Stimulation Therapy (BLST) is a neuropsychological treatment adapted from a treatment called EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing). EMDR is a gold standard treatment according to the World Health Organisation for the psychological treatment of trauma. Bilateral Stimulation is a key therapeutic tool used in EMDR. \n\nBilateral Stimulation simply means stimulation of both sides of the brain using eye movements, sound or tactile stimulation. Typically, it may involve moving your eyes from left to right whilst following a target or paying attention to sound in your left ear then to your right. Bilateral stimulation is referred to as a ‘bottom – up’ approach as it works on the emotion engine of the brain, the limbic system. This approach reduces emotional distress which allows the cortical areas of the brain (thinking, reasoning, planning) to become more active and effective. The effect of this approach is often experienced more quickly and easily.\n\nBecause this therapy uses one element of EMDR, it is called BLST so as to not confuse or give the user a wrong impression about the complete standard EMDR therapy. BLST uses one part of EMDR, and therefore 2can be practiced at home, work or any quiet environment where you can spend five minutes or so undisturbed much like meditation. For more information about BLST and EMDR please visit www.mromeopsych.com/blst\n\nThis minimal app uses bilateral click which, when activated, sounds alternately in each ear. The speed, tone and length of the practice can be set by the user. The App has two options: 1. BLST mode (bilateral stimulation with sound) and 2. FLASH (an adaption of Dr Phillip Manfield’s FLASH technique. Please visit https://www.flashtechnique.com for more information).\n\nThis app is a clinical tool for psychologists, psychiatrists, EMDR therapists and their patients. While information is provided at www.mromeopsych.com/blst, you should consult your EMDR therapist before using it. Please note: Persons suffering with complex PTSD Dissociative Identity Disorder, Borderline Personality, Schizophrenia or unstable neurological conditions (eg; epilepsy) should not use this product without consultation with your therapist.\n\nAs we are frequently updating this app to improve it’s functionality and increase its features, we ask that any comments or suggestions that you have, please contact us at admin@mromeopsych.com. Thank you."

The app is highly customizable and useful in all medical specialties.\n\nEntries are securely kept in your iOS device and are not sent to any outside server, website or database. Reports are created and saved as a password protected PDF file (encrypted using AES-128) and a CSV (comma-separated values) file that is compressed to a ZIP file (which allows password protection and is encrypted using AES-256) to comply with HIPAA security requirements. The reports can then be emailed, accessed via iTunes and the Files app, sent using AirDrop, or copied to your iCloud Drive or DropBox. CSV files can be imported into a spreadsheet program.\n\nOne should not rely on this app alone to keep track of their procedures and is advised to frequently backup the files created. Information on backing up and restoring your data is included in the app's Help/Instructions view.\n\nFEATURES\n• Keep a log of the procedures you have performed, assisted in, were 2nd assist in, observed, supervised, and/or interpreted for documentation purposes.\n• Document the patient's name, ID number, age, date performed, location, supervisor, diagnosis, complications and additional notes with the procedures performed.

Physical Therapist Assistant Content Master is designed to assist physical therapist assistants to possess full command of core academic content. Physical Therapist Assistant Content Master is an ideal tool for physical therapist assistant students, recent physical therapist assistant graduates, and licensed physical therapist assistants.\n\nThe academic content is organized into unique system and non-system categories. \n\nMusculoskeletal System\nNeuromuscular System\nCardiopulmonary System\nOther Systems\nEquipment and Devices\nTherapeutic Modalities\nSafety and Protection\nProfessional Responsibilities\nResearch\n\nPhysical therapist assistants can review selected content by scrolling through subcategories in each of the system and non-system areas. Our innovative design presents academic content in a user-friendly format that allows users to easily digest essential information. Users rate their competence in a variety of topics and create personalized Study Stacks. Study Stacks allow users to efficiently remediate identified academic deficiencies. Frequent review of essential academic content allows users to successfully convert the information to long-term memory. \n\nPhysical Therapist Assistant Content Master includes an assessment mode that consists of 600 multiple-choice questions. Each multiple-choice question has four unique options and an explanation supporting the correct answer. The multiple-choice questions are designed to assess a user’s mastery of the information presented in the content review mode. The number of questions in each category varies from a minimum of 25 to a maximum of 125. Our Content Tag feature allows users to quickly review questions by topic area (i.e., special tests, cranial nerves, pulmonary function tests). \n\nA formal score report describes a physical therapist assistant’s level of mastery cumulatively, by category, and by timeline. Each of the individual reports provides users with valuable performance data to assess their present level of academic mastery. Utilization of the app on a frequent basis considerably strengthens a physical therapist assistant’s knowledge base and provides the necessary foundation to progress to higher level licensing-like questions. \n\nCompany Information\nScorebuilders is a physical therapist owned company whose sole focus is to prepare students for the National Physical Therapy Examinations. We sell more review products and offer more review courses than any other company. Scorebuilders has experienced three decades of continuous growth and is the recognized leader in physical therapy licensing preparation. Scorebuilders offers candidates the knowledge and insight necessary to achieve their goal of becoming a licensed physical therapist assistant on the first attempt.\n\nCopyright © 2019 Scorebuilders\n\nPhysical Therapist Assistant Content Master is the exclusive property of Scorebuilders.

You will discover if it has become melanoma, that’s a malignant mole, or if it’s benign.\nA skin cancer self exam is used to identify suspicious moles or lesions that may be cancer or growths that may develop into skin cancer (precancers). Individuals who are at a high risk of skin cancer are encouraged to perform frequent skin self exams. It is explained, within the app, how to track and review the moles and lesions.\nWhen it comes to Skin Cancer, there is a lot of information out there and it's very hard to be sure you're making the right decisions. That's where this app becomes more and more useful. By using Artificial Intelligence, we can help take some of the guesswork out of your condition. \n\nSkin cancer is the most prevalent type of cancer. Melanoma, specifically, is responsible for 75% of skin cancer deaths, despite being the least common skin cancer. The American Cancer Society estimates over 100,000 new melanoma cases were diagnosed in 2020.\n\nSource datasets: \nAs the leading healthcare organization for informatics in medical imaging, the Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine (SIIM)'s mission is to advance medical imaging informatics through education, research, and innovation in a multi-disciplinary community. SIIM is joined by the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC), an international effort to improve melanoma diagnosis. The ISIC Archive contains the largest publicly available collection of quality-controlled dermoscopic images of skin lesions.

It will help you receive more money every month from the VA for your injuries and help you document your injuries and treatment.\n\nThis app is not just a calculator, it will tell you what information you need to provide (based on your selected injuries/diagnoses) and allow you to document and save the information in order to receive the most compensation for your injuries and illnesses.  It allows you to document your injuries, symptoms, doctor visits, episodes and medications.  It helps you save and organize the information in a secure encrypted database. When you are ready for your VA interview, email all of your injuries with your documentation to yourself or the VA.  If you don't provide documentation to the VA, you may not receive the full compensation for your injuries or illnesses.  It works completely offline, without an internet connection.\n\nThe VA will rely on YOU to provide them with all of the medical information that is pertinent to the injury you are claiming.  They cannot not look through your medical records for you.\n\n** Active duty personnel - Download it before you deploy!\n\n**  Use it to track injuries, and care given for you or your battle buddy.  Everything in the app is self contained so it works when you are not connected to the internet.\n\n** Veterans - My VA Benefits tells you how get a copy of your medical records from the Department of Defense (DoD) and the VA.  It also helps you request your medical records using the Freedom Of Information Act (FOIA).\n\n** If you cannot find your diagnosis, let us know and we will research if for you.  Just submit your question to our forum at our website: http://myvabenefits.us/\n\n**Submit questions to our forum: http://myvabenefits.us/index.php/forum/index \n\n** We provide free updates for the app with the latest codes and rate tables when the VA releases them.\n\n** If you encounter an issue with the app, do not uninstall it or you may lose your data.  Just contact us at http://myvabenefits.us and we will fix it.\n\n** For Back injuries see code 5320 or search for \"spine\".\n\n** For Hearing loss, you cannot self-diagnose because \"An examination for hearing impairment for VA purposes must be conducted by a state-licensed audiologist and must include a controlled speech discrimination test (Maryland CNC) and a puretone audiometry test. Examinations will be conducted without the use of hearing aids.\""

      "label": "Squeezy has helped thousands of women regain confidence in their pelvic floor. Pelvic health specialists around the world recommend Squeezy to their patients every day because it works.\n\nAround 30,000 people use Squeezy regularly to help them remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises. So if you are thinking about downloading Squeezy for your pelvic floor, you are not alone. \n\nAll women should be doing these exercises and some will be doing them as part of a physiotherapy programme.\n\nSqueezy is simple to use, informative and designed to help women to remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises (also known as Kegel exercises). \n\nFeatures includes:\n• A pre-set exercise plan that follows public health guidelines\n• A record of the number of exercises you have completed, compared to your target\n• Visual and audio guides for exercises\n• Exercise reminders with customisable settings\n• Educational information about the pelvic floor\n• “Professional mode” – if working with a pelvic health specialist, you can tailor the exercise plan to fit your needs\n• A bladder diary to keep track of your symptoms, if required\n• Simple and clear interface\n\nSqueezy has been clinically reviewed and approved by the NHS for its clinical safety, and is compliant with NHS Information Governance requirements.\n\nSqueezy won several industry awards including ehi Awards 2016, Health Innovation Network 2016, National Continence Care Awards 2015/16 and was a finalist for awards including Advancing Healthcare Awards 2014 and 2017, Abbvie Sustainable Healthcare Awards 2016.\n\nFor more about Squeezy and additional pelvic health information visit squeezyapp.com.\n\n*Apple Watch users*\nDuring your exercises you need to hold your finger on your Apple Watch face to keep it live and running. The play button changes to state ‘Hold’ when running an exercise.\n\nThis keeps your Watch from dozing off while your attention is focused on your pelvic floor. Most Watch screens go to sleep after 7 or 15 seconds (time dependent on your Watch settings). Squeezy has no control over the screen sleep time on the Watch; it has to obey your Watch settings. \n\nWe hope to be able to improve the Watch experience in future. In the meantime, we’re continuing the existing Watch support because many people find it helpful.\n\nIf you have feedback on the Apple Watch, please get in touch with the developers directly on help@squeezyapp.com.\n\n\nThis app has been translated into Saudi Arabian Arabic.\nتمت ترجمه هذا التطبيق الى اللغه العربيه ( المملكه العربيه السعوديه)‏"

At that time, the treating team is away and you're on call, running all over the hospital.  \n\nMD on Call gives you tips on how to QUICKLY assess and manage (acutely) common problems so you can go on assessing the next patient, or to your room to get some well deserved sleep.  -- it is NOT meant to replace a textbook --\n \n\n\nFEATURES\nMD on call is divided into 5 main sections:\n\n• Issues •  26 frequent on call situations (including management of some specific conditions)\n\nAbdominal Pain*\nAcute Coronary Syndrome*\nAgitation / Violence\nAnaphylaxis\nBleeding\nBradycardia*\nChest Pain\nConstipation\nDeath (Pronouncing)\nDecreased LOC\nDysuria / UTI*\nDyspnea\nFever\nFebrile neutropenia\nHeadache\nHypertension\nHypotension\nInsomnia\nMeningitis\nNausea / Vomiting\nPain\nPalliation\nPneumonia\nSeizure\nTachycardia\nWound Dehiscence\nWound Infection\n\n• Labs •  Common electrolytes abnormalities (including management)\n\nHypo Ca, K, Mg, Na, PO4, glycemia\nHyper Ca, K, Na, glycemia\n\n• ECG •  Normal and abnormal ECG values, now with examples\n\n• Misc •  Suggestions on how to write orders for admission, \"comfort measures only\", \"on call\" notes, OR and procedure notes.  \nTransfusions:  general information and common reactions\nMisc:  CSF values, opioid conversion...\n\n• Lines and Tubes • How to manage common problems, such as a blocked NG tube.\n\n• Search •  Search using acronyms or keywords\n\n\n****************\n\nFeedback is more than welcome :  visit the website for more details\n\n**************** \n\n\nDISCLAIMER\n\nThis publication (application) is to be used as a guide only.

      "label": "An amazing dog health monitor app that allows you to listen to your dog's heartbeat (using just your iPhone microphone), then record and share with your Vet. Whether it is a Black Labrador or a Daschund,  Snoopy will work with any breed of dog. No Accessories required. Designed to help dog breeds who may be prone to dog heart murmurs.\n\nHowever, we strongly recommend using Airpods or bluetooth headphones for listening to and recording your dog's heartbeat.\n\n\"Yes, it works. Very cool.\" Craig Laws, Beta Tester and his Border Collie, Storm. \n\n\nHELPING DOG HEART MURMURS / CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE (CHF)\nOver 60% of all dogs who are 5 years old or more have a dog heart murmur. Snoopy helps track and monitor your dog's health by regularly recording their heart rate and rhythm. Ideal for those at risk of dog heart murmur.\n\n- Irregular heartbeat or racing pulse\n- Hacking, persistent cough\n- Excessive panting even when resting\n- Lack of energy or appetite\n- Collapsing or fainting\n- Gums and/or tongue are bluish in color\n- Severe water retention\n\nSnoopy allows you to:\n- Listen to, record and share your dog's heartbeat\n- Log data about your dog over time\n- Share data and recordings with your vet for them to check your dog remotely\n\nDeveloped with pet owners like you in mind: A trustworthy, safe and easy-to-use way to record the dog heart beat regularly to share with your vet online - thus saving on expensive trips.\n\nThe quality of the recordings are unrivalled. Snoopy has been extensively tested on various dog breeds of all shapes and sizes from border collies to black labradors and spaniels, including those with congestive heart failure and using cardalis app.\n\n\"I was skeptical at first. Great app! Worth it.\" - Mike and his dog, Freddie.\n\n**** But honestly, does it actually work on all dog breeds?? ****\nYes. We've sound-engineered ways to attempt to isolate the dog's heartbeat sounds and, using an advanced algorithm, amplify them making them easier to detect and hear. It takes time, technique and patience.\n\nThe app will work on all breeds including puppy heart rates! Ideal for owners concerned about their dog's heart health or dogs with CHF (congestive heart failure) or using cardalis.\n\nWe want you to be happy with Snoopy. If you are struggling DO contact us via support. We want to help you!\n\n\nFAQs\n\n**** No Accessories Required ****\nWe use your phone's internal microphone to attempt to listen to and record your dog's heart rate. We recommend the use of Bluetooth headphones for better sound and generally dog's prefer this but it isn't required to use the app.\n\n**** How It Works ****\n1. Snoopy Dog Heartbeat has been precisely engineered to listen to dog heartbeat sounds, then record and amplify them. \n2. It works best when the dog is lying down and with Airpods or Bluetooth headphones.\n3. Wet your dog's hair around the heart to ensure a good connection with the skin. Remove the case, be in a very quiet room.\n4. Our simple recording management makes it easy.\n5. Take a dog selfie if you wish and share.\n6. Track and monitor your dog's health weekly.\n\n**** Easy Share Feature ****\nYou can opt to share via Facebook, Whats App, Instagram or email to send over to your vet.\n\n**** Before you start... ****\nYou DO need to carefully follow the instructions for Snoopy to work. A quiet room is critical for results as the mic is super-sensitive in the heartbeat range. Snoopy doesn't fake the heartbeat. \n\n**** Supported Phones ****\n13, 13 Max, 12, 12 Max, X, Xs, XR, 11, 11 Pro, 8, 7, 7+, SE, 6s, 6s+, 6, 6+. We don't support iPad. Use the device on Airplane mode.\n\n**** Is it a substitute for medical devices/support? ****\nNo. Under no circumstances is Snoopy a substitute for veterinary consultation. Please consult a professional for any advice. \n\nPlease do check our T&Cs before downloading.\n\nFor results examples: www.facebook.com/snoopydoghealth\n\nDog heart murmurs can be found in all breeds of dog."

      "label": "This is the successor the the popular, award-winning, best selling, doctor recommended pain tracking app, My Pain Diary: Chronic Pain & Symptom Tracker.\n\nThis version, My Pain Diary: GOLD EDITION, strikes a delicate balance between ease-of-use and a broad feature-set. This is a truly USEFUL app, and the newest member of the My Pain Diary family, which has helped over 90,000 chronic pain sufferers better manage their pain, improve communication with their doctors, and gain insights that would be hard attain through other means.\n\nUseful and popular features include automatic weather fetching, iCloud sync, basic medication tracking, photo attachments, graphs and PDF doctor's reports.\n\nThis app is highly customizable. Everyone tracks pain differently, and this is a framework that supports just about any tracking strategy.\n\nCreated by a chronic pain patient to track, manage, and report on chronic pain and symptoms, chronic illness, and mental health.\n\nThat means there is no big company with deep pockets supporting this project. I am just one man with a chronic pain condition, a demanding day job, and a young family to care for. I just happen to be formally trained in design, self-taught in programming, experienced at marketing and customer relations, and am a chronic pain patient myself. That's a very rare combination of traits that is hard to come by, so I'm making the most of it, and holding my own against the big players.\n\nEnough about me, back to the app!\n\nFeatures:\n+   iCloud Sync Support\n+   Universal App\n+   Highly Customizable\n+   Easy to use \n+   Track unlimited conditions\n+   Track multiple/unlimited times per day\n+   Add past entries (change entry timestamp)\n+   Edit past entries\n\nANATOMY OF A PAIN DIARY ENTRY\n\nTRACKERS: Trackers can be thought of as labels or folders that categorize and differentiate your entries. These are the key to tracking more than one condition and comparing conditions to each other.\n\nA common strategy is to name the Trackers after the diseases/conditions that you will be tracking. I.e. Migraines, Anxiety, Fibromyalgia, etc. These are just examples. \n\nMETRICS: Each entry is composed of one or more optional pieces of information called 'Metrics'. For example, two commonly used metrics are 'Pain Intensity' and 'Pain Duration'. Metrics are associated with and shared amongst your Trackers. This means that you can set it up to use different metrics for different Trackers, keeping your entry pages clean and the cognitive load low.\n\n -- MEDICATION TRACKING --\n+   Basic medication tracking.\n\n -- IMPORTANT EVENTS --\n+   Record important events that aren't suited for a Pain Diary entry. i.e. Medical Procedures, Therapy Sessions, A slip and fall, etc.\n\n -- HISTORY --\n+    Color-Coded Calendar - Spot patterns and trends at a glance. Calendar days are colored based on the day's highest recorded Intensity.\n+   Fully searchable.\n+   Day View\n\n -- GRAPHS --\n+   Visualize and compare intensity over time with this interactive graph. Plot and compare up to 3 'Trackables' at once and one optional Weather Metric.\n+   Email, print and share a PDF of the Graph.\n\n -- REPORTS --\n+   Create a PDF Report for your Doctors or for archival purposes. Share the Report via email and other standard methods.\n+   Include Graph\n+   Include Pain Scale Descriptions\n+   Include Color-Coded-Calendar\n+   Include Medication Log\n+   Include Important Events\n\n -- TOOLS --\n+   Automatic Weather Fetching\n+   Pain Scale Editor\n+   Units preference - US/Imperial or XUS/Metric\n\n\nWant to see the app in action?

      "label": "Focus Builder is optimized for use on an iPad.\n\nEye movements are a very powerful way to exercise the brain and to create long-term change in the brain, known as plasticity.  The “Focus Builder” app contains a variety of exercises which challenge users to voluntarily move their eyes in various patterns, speeds and directions, which have been proven to activate specific parts of the brain depending on which eye movement is performed.\n\nThis app is specifically designed for doctors that specialize in Functional Neurology and their patients.  There is currently no app available that can provide these specific exercises.  For best results, patients should consult a Functional Neurologist to determine how to use this app according to their needs and obtain the most therapeutic value.\n\nThere are 3 types of eye movements that can have profound therapeutic benefits and all three are available in this app.  \n1.Pursuits (slow eye movements):  Smooth pursuit eye movements allow the eyes to closely follow a moving object.  Most people are unable to initiate pursuit without a moving visual signal. The pursuit of targets moving with velocities of greater than 30°/s tend to require catch-up saccades.\n2.Saccades (fast eye movements):  Saccades are quick, simultaneous movements of both eyes in the same direction.  Initiated cortically by the frontal eye fields (FEF), or subcortically by the superior colliculus, saccades serve as a mechanism for fixation, rapid eye movement, and the fast phase of optokinetic nystagmus.\n3.Anti-saccades (look away):  The anti-saccade task has emerged as an important task for investigating the flexible control that we have over behavior. In this task, participants must suppress the reflexive urge to look at a visual target that appears suddenly in the peripheral visual field and must instead look away from the target in the opposite direction. A crucial step involved in performing this task is the top-down inhibition of a reflexive, automatic saccade. Patients diagnosed with various neurological and/or psychiatric disorders that affect the frontal lobes or basal ganglia find it difficult to suppress the automatic pro-saccade, revealing a deficit in top-down inhibition.\n\nThe areas of the brain that are activated by these eye movements are too numerous to list, but to name a few, I have listed some of the functions that can improve with these eye exercises.\n1.Executive function/behavior\n2.Attention\n3.Concentration\n4.Impulse control\n5.Social behavior\n6.Motivation\n7.Goal directed behavior"

      "label": "A mobile device-based Patient Care Report app. PCR EMS lets first responders record patient information at the scene in a fast, secure way on your iPhone or iPad. Don't lose information by writing it on your glove or on a piece of paper! The menus are designed in the order in which information is normally entered, and any submenu can be used without being dependent on another submenu. For example, you could enter the patient's chief complaint, age, and name  from the Dispatcher before you reach the scene, then fill in the rest of the patient information a t the scene. Or enter Vitals before doing the subjective interview.\n\n Dozens of features, including:\n\n  * stand-alone: no other app or Internet required\n  * multiple pcrs\n  * data and date pickers for most fields eliminate typing errors\n  * full ambulance information including: unit, mileage, times at various locations\n  * full patient bio and insurance information\n  * multiple vitals including: blood pressure, pulse, respiration, blood glucose, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), responsiveness.\n  * full subjective (SAMPLE history)\n  * full objective (primary and secondary assessment)\n     - primary assessment: general impression, airway, breathing, circulation, rapid scan, priority\n        of care and transport.\n     - secondary assessment: breathing, circulation, airway, detailed menus for each body part.\n  * multiple interventions (medications and procedures)\n    - pre-filled menus for medications and procedures\n    - medication and procedure lists can be modified within the app\n  * a chronology of all actions taken\n  * a self-generating narrative\n  * capture and print patient signatures for: accept privacy practices , accept treatment, refuse treatment, accept transport, refuse transport\n  * print detailed screens for key data\n  * enter multiple notes for the patient\n  * and, of course, a printed PCR.\n\nIn addition to actual use in a patient-care environment, PCR EMS is a great tool for field-training officers to teach EMTs how to write a PCR.  It can also be used as an education aid to present scenarios for studying for exams such as the NREMT.\n\nFor the Notes feature, you might imagine the following scenarios: a  paramedic returning from a call fills the ambulance gas tank and makes a note of the mileage, cost, and gallons; an EMT on patient intake notes that a 14 year old girl was not accompanied by a parent or guardian but determines that she is a emancipated minor; a field training officer notes the performance of a trainee at every step in the examination. All these and many more possible with Notes!\n\nPCR EMS keeps all data on the iPhone. This eliminates the problem with other ePCR systems of being dependent on the Internet and thus being inoperable in regions without a strong cell signal.\n\nPCR EMS also recognizes that large differences may exist on the content and format of patient care reports in different regions and systems.  Therefore, the printed report incorporates the basic information and does not attempt to format the report. But the report can be printed on any AirPrint-compatible printer."

      "label": "* The world's number 1 DAF app is used by thousands of people in over one hundred countries. *\n\nDAF Professional has been created to help people who stammer or have a neurological disease such as Parkinson's Disease. It helps people to slow their rate of speech which makes it clearer to others.\n\nDAF Professional is an easy to use professional speech therapy tool which could make a huge difference to you or someone you know.\n\nDAF Professional has been designed and tested by a certified and practicing Speech and Language Therapist (MSc, PGDip, BAHons, HPC registered and member of RCSLT). DAF Professional delivers incredibly low latency feedback even when running in the background.\n\nDelayed Auditory Feedback (DAF) is a well established speech and language therapy tool which helps people to speak more slowly. However, until recently, devices have been cumbersome to carry around, difficult to adjust, very expensive and therefore not widely used.\n\nDAF was originally developed for people who stammer, but has since been shown to work with people with other speech difficulties, such as those with Parkinson's Disease (Downie et al., 1981; Dagenaise, Outhwood & Lee, 1998; Lowit et al., 2006 and most recentely Lowit et al., 2010).\n\nIt works by enabling someone to hear his or her own speech in an altered manner. This disruption to the normal auditory feedback loop causes the speaker to slow down. Research has shown that DAF will be of benefit to approximately a third of people who have a stammer or Parkinson's. Clinical research has not been carried out as yet on other client groups however DAF may well be of benefit to people with other medical speech conditions.\n\nWhen using Bluetooth devices there is an additional delay of 60ms added to the feedback system.\n\nIf you do use a Bluetooth headset you may find you need to turn the bluetooth device on after opening the app to enable it.\n\nDAF Professional works when put in the background or the screen is turned off. Like all apps of this type, it can NOT work during phone calls or with other media apps playing at the same time.\n\nIf you wish to provide any feedback we would be delighted to hear from you. Please email us at support@speechtools.co.\n\nOur lead Speech and Language Therapist is Samantha Brady who qualified as a Speech and Language Therapist in 2001 (PGDip, City University) and gained her Masters in Speech and Language Therapy in 2006 (MSc, City University). She has a wealth of experience of working as a Speech and Language Therapist in a variety of settings and her area of clinical expertise is adult neurology and voice. Samantha is a member of the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists (RCSLT), HPC Registered (SL10250) and Lee Silverman Voice Treatment Certified (LSVT).\n\nDAF Professional is fully GDPR compliant and will not collect any of your data without first asking for your consent."

This app does not replace the original manuscript of these landmark critical care trials – instead, it serves as a fast reference and learning tool for some of the most important ICU trials over a wide range of specialties.\n\nEach entry contains a short one-liner about the critical care trial and key points, which includes only the most pertinent details, such as inclusion/exclusion criteria, treatment protocols, pertinent endpoints and findings, as well as expert commentary regarding key subgroup analyses or limitations to the trial.\n\nWant to send a colleague a citation? Use the \"Share Trial\" button to send a PubMed link and quick summary. Using this feature, it’s incredibly easy to share pivotal critical care trials with students, residents, and other colleagues.\n\nThe database features 150+ landmark trials related to: ARDS, cardiac arrest, DVT/PE, delirium, glycemic control, heart failure, hemorrhage, meningitis, nephroprotection, nutrition, pneumonia, sedation, seizure, sepsis/shock, spinal cord injury, stroke, and subarachnoid hemorrhage – with more trials and topics to be added on a regular basis!\n\nThis app is designed and maintained by Sean P.

      "label": "Anyone who snores at night is usually exhausted and not well rested the next morning. But not only that, the (spouse) partner is also prevented from sleeping because of the noise. \n\nMost of the time you will be confronted with the words: \"I have to fall asleep before you, otherwise you will start snoring and I won't be able to sleep.\" \n\nSnoring can thus become a real test of patience and there are even said to be cases where partners are no longer (able to) sleep in the same room.\n\nAlthough the number of men who snore is higher, there are also many women who snore. Therefore, this problem affects all genders.\n\nThere are several possible remedies on the market. But not all of them deliver what they promise, are expensive or very unwieldy.\n\nThis Anti-Snore-App is an anti-snoring solution that works through a completely \"natural\" concept. \n\nIn the past, did your partner, with a (gentle) nudge, make you change your sleeping position to stop snoring?\n\nThis practice is a common method between many couples in bed to stop the other from snoring. \n\nThis approach often serves its purpose. However, it is usually the case that both are awake at night and then have to fall asleep again. \n\nOur Anti-Snore-App automatically fulfills exactly this purpose without anyone having to wake up for it.  \n\nAfter a short orientation period, our Silent Night app promises you: \n\n- restful and regenerative sleep for everyone involved\n- reduced disturbance of the partner's rest\n- improved oxygen intake due to the shifting of the body\n\nOur app uses state-of-the-art algorithms from the field of machine learning. We use it to evaluate your current sleeping sounds and provide you with unconscious assistance through vibrations. \n\nOf course, your data remains completely recorded on the device and will be deleted immediately after evaluation. This means that not only your restful sleep but also the protection of your data is in the forefront.\n\nLikewise, all processes operate directly on the device, data and radio connections can be independently deactivated by you (recommended!) overnight.\n\n----\nDisclaimer for medical services\n\nThis Anti-Snore-App is not a medical device and is not intended to replace professional medical advice and/or diagnoses. The Anti-Snore-App is not intended to diagnose or treat respiratory failure or other diseases/medical conditions. Please consult a licensed physician before making any decisions or taking any actions that may affect your health, safety and well-being. Do not ignore professional advice based on things you have seen, heard or read on the app, website or social media. Always consult a healthcare professional if you have questions or concerns about your snoring or overall health."

      "label": "The Rotterdam Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator is based on ERSPC, Rotterdam, data and supported by the Prostate Cancer Research Foundation, Rotterdam (SWOP)\n \n \nThe Prostate Cancer Research Foundation, Rotterdam, Stichting Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek Prostaatkanker (SWOP), is an initiative of the Department of Urology of the Erasmus MC, the University and Medical Centre of Rotterdam, in The Netherlands. Its goal is the financial support of scientific research projects in the field of prostate cancer, as well as other cancers of the urinary tract.\nPlease be aware that the Rotterdam Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator for iOS cannot be 100% accurate at predicting the presence or absence of prostate cancer. It is designed to help calculate your risk, not give a definitive diagnosis.\nThe Rotterdam Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator for iOS provides a general risk calculation based on your PSA level and other information.\nWhile knowing your PSA level is helpful, the decision to have a PSA test has to be taken seriously after weighing up all factors and discussing the implications with your GP or hospital doctor.\nIt is possible that prostate cancer will not be found even if you have an elevated PSA. However, it may be present even if your PSA level is low.\nYour doctor may want to take further tests. If you have doubts or questions about your health, you should always contact your GP or hospital doctor. This is particularly important if you have questions which arise from the use of our prostate cancer risk calculator.\nIt cannot be ruled out that the way the Rotterdam Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator for iOS is used, or the indications given by it, are interpreted in a manner that is not appropriate. The creators of the Rotterdam Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator for iOS do not accept any responsibility in any respect.\nThe European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer has published its 11-year follow-up results (New England Journal of Medicine, March 15 2012). Once again, they demonstrate that screening does significantly reduce death from prostate cancer. The latest study confirms that a man who undergoes PSA testing will have his risk of dying from prostate cancer reduced by 29%.\nERSPC is the world’s largest randomized prostate cancer screening study. It was designed to investigate whether early detection and treatment of prostate cancer might reduce disease-specific mortality and also help to identify men at risk. From 1992, the ERSPC study randomized 162,000 men, aged 55 to 69, across Europe to either a screening arm or a control group.\n\nDesigned and developed for iOS by Nuno Azevedo of Ydeal.net Software LDA"

Record or import photos and videos to create a visual record of tantrums or their aftermath.\n\nAn overview of the features provided by the app are:\n\n- Track multiple individuals, or import them from your Contacts list, and track their tantrums on an incident by incident basis through visual selection of simple information points.\n\n- Track the locations of tantrums, the types of behavior, the causes  (precipitators), responses taken, what mitigated the tantrums and the resolutions of an incident.\n\n- Track daily gluten, casein and medication details.\n\n- Add and remove your own user defined categories for behaviors, locations, precipitators, mitigators, responses and resolutions.\n\n- Record videos (up to 10 minutes), or take photos, for each tantrum incident, or its aftermath, from within the app or import existing photos or videos from your Photo Library. The photos or videos are tracked along with the tantrum data and made available through a media gallery for viewing and playback on your device.\n\n- Multiple ways to view your data, either in a calendar view or in a table view.\n\n- Provides a full \"notes\" system, which is available for providing text annotations (up to 25,000 characters)  on tantrum incidents, or for general notes and observations related to the individual.\n\n- Both media and notes data may be shared through e-mail, and photos and videos may be exported to your Photo Library.\n\n- Statistics for any individual may be viewed through a visual charting/graphing interface right on your device.\n\n- Export tantrum data as a CSV (comma separated values) file. Data is made available for download to your computer through iTunes for import into a any spreadsheet application where it may be viewed through more detailed charts and templates.\n\n- Built in documentation, for help while off-line.\n\n- Internationalized for most English speaking countries."

The model is based on data derived from women found to have at least one adnexal tumor that was judged not to be physiological, underwent a standardized ultrasound examination, and was later selected for surgery. \n\nThe ADNEX model contains nine predictors: age, serum CA-125 (U/ml), type of center (oncology vs other), maximum lesion diameter, proportion of solid tissue, number of papillary projections, the presence of >10 cyst locules, acoustic shadows, and ascites. An oncology center is defined as a tertiary referral center with a specific gynecological oncological unit. \n\nThe model was developed by clinicians and statisticians from the International Ovarian Tumour Analysis (IOTA) group, and is based on clinical and ultrasound data from almost 6000 women recruited at 24 centers in 10 countries (Italy, Belgium, Sweden, Czech Republic, Poland, France, UK, China, Spain, and Canada).\n\nA full description of model development and validation is given in Van Calster B, Van Hoorde K, Valentin L, Testa AC, Fischerova D, Van Holsbeke C, Savelli L, Franchi D, Epstein E, Kaijser J, Van Belle V, Czekierdowski A, Guerriero S, Fruscio R, Lanzani C, Scala F, Bourne T, Timmerman D.

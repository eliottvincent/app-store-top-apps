      "label": "Pregnant? This is for YOU!\nOur leading app allows you to use just your iPhone microphone to record and share your baby’s sounds. It is the best-in-class, has excellent reviews, is super simple and safe to use. Now supports Apple Airpods and Bluetooth Headphones.\n\n\"It took some time and patience... thank you for creating this cheap, awesome technology to use at home.\" - Niki\n\nCategory #1 in the USA and 102 other countries. Here's why...\n\nDeveloped by parents like you (with expertise in sound engineering and app development) who wanted a trustworthy, safe and easy-to-use way to record our baby's fetal sounds (kicks, heartbeat etc.) - and keep a record of a quality that we hadn't been able to find before in other apps. It has been extensively tested on expectant mothers.\n\n\"I was skeptical at first. Great app! Worth it.\" - Legretta \n\n**** But honestly, does it actually work?? ****\nYes. We've sound-engineered ways to attempt to isolate the baby's heart beat, sounds (kicks, heart beat and more) and using an advanced algorithm, amplify them making them easier to detect and hear.\n\nNOTE: It takes time, technique and patience and depends on the position and number of weeks of your baby so you'll need to stick with it. When you do, our results are excellent. Results are best between 27-40 weeks as your baby is bigger and stronger. \n\nWe constantly improve our extensive tutorial and techniques to handhold you through - we even have a support group on Facebook so you can get help.\n\nWe want you to be happy with Hear My Baby heartbeat and getting results can sometimes be difficult.  If you are struggling (can't find your own heartbeat etc. DO contact us via support. We want to help you!\n\nGIFT THIS APP: Click the “Buy App” arrow on the iTunes® App Store\n\n\nFAQs\n\n**** No Accessories Required ****\nWe use the internal microphone from your phone to attempt to listen and record your fetal sound. We recommend Bluetooth Headphones for best results.\n\n**** How It Works ****\n1. Hear My Baby, has been precisely engineered to listen to abdominal sounds, then record and amplify them. Listen to your own heartbeat first to confirm the app is set up correctly. \n2. It works best when baby is head down and their back is facing forwards.\n3. Remove the case, be in a very quiet room and focus on your lower abdomen. Listen then Tap record.\n4. Our simple recording management helps you to keep a record of your special moment\n5. Take a selfie if you wish and share \n6. We'll walk you through exactly how to get the best baby heartbeat results.\n\n**** Easy Share Feature ****\nSharing is awesome you can opt to share via Facebook, Whats App, Instagram or email.\n\n**** We Care About Your Privacy ****\nWe take your privacy and special moment seriously. You decide who sees or hears it and can delete it at any time.\n\n**** Before you start... ****\nYou DO need to carefully follow the instructions for Hear My Baby to work. A quiet room is critical for results as the mic is super sensitive.   HMB doesn't fake the baby heartbeat or other fetal sounds :) \n\nPlease Note: results are normally superb, however the recording may not work if your placenta is at the front of the tummy or the baby is in the wrong position.\n\n**** Supported Phones ****\n13,12, X, Xs, 11, 11 Pro, 8, 7, 7+, SE, 6s, 6s+, 6, 6+ 5c, 5s & 5. We don't support iPad.\n\n**** Worried about safety? We are too! ***\nHMB is safe but to be extra sure DO switch your iPhone to airplane mode. This is a precaution and automatically stops all cellular transmissions.\n\n**** Is it a substitute for medical devices/support? ****\nNo - under no circumstances is HMB a substitute for medical support - if you don't get a result it doesn't mean anything is wrong :) Consult your doctor for any advice. We are NOT approved by the FDA. This is not a medical device and is not a medical baby heartbeat monitor. It is for FUN.\n\nPlease do check our T&Cs before downloading.\n\nFor results examples: www.facebook.com/hearmybaby\nwww.instagram.com/hearmybabyapp"

The guidelines articles, as published in the Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease, as well as the comprehensive risk estimates, can be accessed through https://www.asccp.org/guidelines.  \n\nThese evidence-based management guidelines, initially developed in 2019, came together through a consensus process of 19 organizations. The updated management guidelines aim to:\n • Allow for a more complete and precise estimation of risk\n • Provide more appropriate intervention for high-risk individuals (detect and treat more precancer)\n • Recommend less intervention for low-risk individuals (decrease testing and treatment that won’t prevent cancer and may cause reproductive harm)\n • Allow for the future addition of new risk modifiers and screening and management technologies\n\nSee https://www.asccp.org/UserGuide for tips on using the app."

She will help you relax between surges with a mix of guided relaxations, positive affirmations, gentle music and calming visualisations. Freya makes it easy for you to keep track of your surges and you can visit the log at any point to see how frequently your surges are coming and how long they are lasting. Freya will also let you know when your labour is established and when it might be a good time to contact your midwife. You will never birth alone with Freya by your side.\n \nTRACK YOUR SURGES\n\nIn hypnobirthing we refer to contractions as surges, as a ‘surge’ more accurately describes the sensation you’ll experience when in labour. Freya is the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the app store, designed specifically with hypnobirthing mums in mind, but can be used by anyone.\n \nPREPARE FOR BIRTH\n\nYou can also use Freya in pregnancy to help you relax and prepare for your birth. In fact the more you listen to the guided relaxations and positive affirmations, the more familiar they will become and the more effective they will be at helping you relax when it comes to birth. Positive affirmations have been proven to change the way your mind works and listening regularly will help you feel less anxious and more confident in the lead up to birth. \n \nTHE SCIENCE\n\nWe know the more relaxed you are during birth, the more oxytocin you will produce. Oxytocin helps your uterus to work efficiently, making labour faster and more comfortable. \n \nLIFESKILLS\n\nYou can also use Freya post-birth any time you feel you could benefit from taking some deep breaths or need some help finding your zen. Everything you learn through using Freya - mindfulness exercises, breathing techniques, the benefits of taking time out - are skills for life.\n\nIf you have any questions or spot any pesky bugs lurking about the place (!) please do let us know at help@thepositivebirthcompany.co.uk\n\nWHAT YOU’LL GET:\n\niPhone and Apple Watch app\nA timer to record your surges (also known as a contraction timer)\nCoaching audio to keep your mind focused on breathing through each surge\nA gentle expanding visualisation which you can use to sync your breathing\nA detailed log of your surges over time, so you can track your progress through labour\nAbility to easily share the log with your birth partner, midwife or doula\nGuided relaxations, positive affirmations and soothing visuals to help keep you calm and relaxed, making birth easier, quicker and more straightforward (can also be used in pregnancy and postnatally)\nCoaching created by renowned hypnobirthing expert Siobhan Miller, founder of The Positive Birth Company\n\nDownload the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the App Store and prepare to meet your baby in the best possible way, feeling calm and confident, relaxed and happy!"

All questions have been revised and updated to provide for the best learning experience.\n\nTopical review tests include sections on Airway, Cardiology, Medical, Trauma, Operations, OB & Pediatrics. All review tests include a detailed written rationale to help you better understand the answer and how to interpret an NREMT style question.\n\nOnce you are ready to test your readiness and challenge your stamina, move on to the two simulated 120-question NREMT exams in the test section.\n\nStill the tough, high-quality questions you have come to expect from Bill Brown, former executive director of the NREMT, the redesigned EMT PASS will prepare you like no other for passing your certification exam."

Physical Therapist Content Master is designed to assist physical therapists to possess full command of core academic content. Physical Therapist Content Master is an ideal tool for physical therapist students, recent physical therapy graduates, and licensed physical therapists.\n\nThe academic content is organized into unique system and non-system categories. \n\nMusculoskeletal System\nNeuromuscular System\nCardiopulmonary System\nOther Systems\nEquipment and Devices\nTherapeutic Modalities\nSafety and Protection\nProfessional Responsibilities\nResearch\n\nPhysical therapists can review selected content by scrolling through subcategories in each of the system and non-system areas. Our innovative design presents academic content in a user-friendly format that allows users to easily digest essential information. Users rate their competence in a variety of topics and create personalized Study Stacks. Study Stacks allow users to efficiently remediate identified academic deficiencies. Frequent review of essential academic content allows users to successfully convert the information to long-term memory. \n\nPhysical Therapist Content Master includes an assessment mode that consists of 750 multiple-choice questions. Each multiple-choice question has four unique options and an explanation supporting the correct answer. The multiple-choice questions are designed to assess a user’s mastery of the information presented in the content review mode. The number of questions in each category varies from a minimum of 25 to a maximum of 175. Our Content Tag feature allows users to quickly review questions by topic area (i.e., special tests, cranial nerves, pulmonary function tests). \n\nA formal score report describes a physical therapist’s level of mastery cumulatively, by category, and by timeline. Each of the individual reports provides users with valuable performance data to assess their present level of academic mastery. Utilization of the app on a frequent basis considerably strengthens a physical therapist’s knowledge base and provides the necessary foundation to progress to higher level licensing-like questions. \n\nCompany Information\nScorebuilders is a physical therapist owned company whose sole focus is to prepare students for the National Physical Therapy Examinations. We sell more review products and offer more review courses than any other company. Scorebuilders has experienced three decades of continuous growth and is the recognized leader in physical therapy licensing preparation.

Using this app is the equivalent to spending hours with the world’s most experienced doctors teaching you about your calcium, parathyroid, osteoporosis, and vitamin D issues. Your tests results are analyzed to determine if a problem exists, what risks are associated, and what to do about it. Beautiful graphs make understanding these problems simple!\n\nBlood tests and bone density scans can be difficult to interpret—even many doctors do not diagnose calcium, vitamin D, and parathyroid problems correctly or timely. Hyperparathyroidism is a disease that affects 1 in 800 people and 1 in 250 women over 50 and is very often overlooked while patients suffer from chronic fatigue, memory loss, depression, osteoporosis, bone pain and many other symptoms. Calcium Pro is a powerful software program that will analyze your calcium health and provide you guidance about the status of your bones, kidneys, parathyroid glands, vitamin D, and other related health issues.\n\nYou start by entering your test results for calcium, parathyroid hormone, and vitamin D. Then we look at your bone density (osteoporosis levels). CalciumPro will analyze and graph your tests making them easy to understand. It will let you know the status of your parathyroid glands and your chance of having hyperparathyroidism. Suggested next steps are given. Tracking tools will show your calcium and vitamin D levels over time, and will show if your bones are losing density (worsening osteoporosis), or gaining bone density. There are important learning tools on every page, and an extensive video and reading library at the end. The app will provide guidance about talking to your physician regarding the possible need for surgery and other important steps.\n\nA Risk Assessment Tool shows your relative risk for conditions associated with high blood calcium: Osteoporosis, Heart Disease, Heart Arrhythmias and Palpitations, High Blood Pressure, Kidney Stones and Kidney Failure, GERD, several Cancers, and others. Watch your risk assessment graphs change as you address your calcium problems. \n\nThis app was developed by doctors at the Norman Parathyroid Center, the world’s leading parathyroid and calcium treatment center using over 4,000,000 data points from over 30,000 patients. Let the world’s leading doctors help you understand these problems so you and your doctor can make important, informed decisions. Take control of your own health!"

      "label": "Designed by a pediatrician, BiliCalc uses the American Academy of Pediatrics 2004 \"Management of Hyperbilirubinemia in Infants Greater than 35 Weeks of Age\" to calculate the threshold for starting phototherapy based on the patient's age, bilirubin level, and neurotoxicity risk. Values are now displayed on the phototherapy nomogram. In addition, it will also tell you the patient's risk zone using the Bhutani Nomogram.\n\nAllows direct age input and includes the option to calculate age from birth and lab sample times. The app has a direct link to source journal articles, nomograms, and a list of the neurotoxicity risk factors. Supports US and SI units (mg/dL and µmol/L).\n\nApp Feature Summary\n-Calculates phototherapy threshold for newborns 35 weeks and older\n-Displays values on phototherapy nomogram\n-Suggests time frame for followup bilirubin levels based on patient risk zone \n-Direct links to reference journal articles\n\n**********************************\nFrequently Asked Questions\n**********************************\n1. I think the graph is backwards. Why is low risk on top and high risk on bottom?\n\nThe graph is directly from the 2004 AAP Hyperbilirubinemia Guidelines. The degree of \"risk\" refers to the infant's risk for developing neurotoxicity. This is different than the Bhutani Nomogram in which \"risk\" refers to the risk for development of severe hyperbilirubinemia. The threshold for treatment (when a data point lies above one of the lines on the graph) of the infant is different based on the predisposing factors (divided into the three risk categories). Babies who are \"low neurotoxicity risk,\" can tolerate higher levels of bilirubin than a baby with medium or high risk. Therefore, a high risk baby will be treated at lower bilirubin levels than a low risk baby. The graph is correct in having low risk on top since a higher value is needed to pass the threshold for treatment (phototherapy). Please see the graph here for verification as well: http://bit.ly/AppPWU. Please email if you have further questions.\n\n******************************************\nIntended for use by pediatricians, neonatologists, physicians, medical students, and pediatric nurses who treat newborn infants in the hospital and as outpatients.\n\nBiliCalc should be used only as a reference aid. The information contained in the app should not be used as a substitute for the exercise of professional clinical judgement.

It will help you receive more money every month from the VA for your injuries and help you document your injuries and treatment.\n\nThis app is not just a calculator, it will tell you what information you need to provide (based on your selected injuries/diagnoses) and allow you to document and save the information in order to receive the most compensation for your injuries and illnesses.  It allows you to document your injuries, symptoms, doctor visits, episodes and medications.  It helps you save and organize the information in a secure encrypted database. When you are ready for your VA interview, email all of your injuries with your documentation to yourself or the VA.  If you don't provide documentation to the VA, you may not receive the full compensation for your injuries or illnesses.  It works completely offline, without an internet connection.\n\nThe VA will rely on YOU to provide them with all of the medical information that is pertinent to the injury you are claiming.  They cannot not look through your medical records for you.\n\n** Active duty personnel - Download it before you deploy!\n\n**  Use it to track injuries, and care given for you or your battle buddy.  Everything in the app is self contained so it works when you are not connected to the internet.\n\n** Veterans - My VA Benefits tells you how get a copy of your medical records from the Department of Defense (DoD) and the VA.  It also helps you request your medical records using the Freedom Of Information Act (FOIA).\n\n** If you cannot find your diagnosis, let us know and we will research if for you.  Just submit your question to our forum at our website: http://myvabenefits.us/\n\n**Submit questions to our forum: http://myvabenefits.us/index.php/forum/index \n\n** We provide free updates for the app with the latest codes and rate tables when the VA releases them.\n\n** If you encounter an issue with the app, do not uninstall it or you may lose your data.  Just contact us at http://myvabenefits.us and we will fix it.\n\n** For Back injuries see code 5320 or search for \"spine\".\n\n** For Hearing loss, you cannot self-diagnose because \"An examination for hearing impairment for VA purposes must be conducted by a state-licensed audiologist and must include a controlled speech discrimination test (Maryland CNC) and a puretone audiometry test. Examinations will be conducted without the use of hearing aids.\""

      "label": "An amazing dog health monitor app that allows you to listen to your dog's heartbeat (using just your iPhone microphone), then record and share with your Vet. Whether it is a Black Labrador or a Daschund,  Snoopy will work with any breed of dog. No Accessories required. Designed to help dog breeds who may be prone to dog heart murmurs.\n\nHowever, we strongly recommend using Airpods or bluetooth headphones for listening to and recording your dog's heartbeat.\n\n\"Yes, it works. Very cool.\" Craig Laws, Beta Tester and his Border Collie, Storm. \n\n\nHELPING DOG HEART MURMURS / CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE (CHF)\nOver 60% of all dogs who are 5 years old or more have a dog heart murmur. Snoopy helps track and monitor your dog's health by regularly recording their heart rate and rhythm. Ideal for those at risk of dog heart murmur.\n\n- Irregular heartbeat or racing pulse\n- Hacking, persistent cough\n- Excessive panting even when resting\n- Lack of energy or appetite\n- Collapsing or fainting\n- Gums and/or tongue are bluish in color\n- Severe water retention\n\nSnoopy allows you to:\n- Listen to, record and share your dog's heartbeat\n- Log data about your dog over time\n- Share data and recordings with your vet for them to check your dog remotely\n\nDeveloped with pet owners like you in mind: A trustworthy, safe and easy-to-use way to record the dog heart beat regularly to share with your vet online - thus saving on expensive trips.\n\nThe quality of the recordings are unrivalled. Snoopy has been extensively tested on various dog breeds of all shapes and sizes from border collies to black labradors and spaniels, including those with congestive heart failure and using cardalis app.\n\n\"I was skeptical at first. Great app! Worth it.\" - Mike and his dog, Freddie.\n\n**** But honestly, does it actually work on all dog breeds?? ****\nYes. We've sound-engineered ways to attempt to isolate the dog's heartbeat sounds and, using an advanced algorithm, amplify them making them easier to detect and hear. It takes time, technique and patience.\n\nThe app will work on all breeds including puppy heart rates! Ideal for owners concerned about their dog's heart health or dogs with CHF (congestive heart failure) or using cardalis.\n\nWe want you to be happy with Snoopy. If you are struggling DO contact us via support. We want to help you!\n\n\nFAQs\n\n**** No Accessories Required ****\nWe use your phone's internal microphone to attempt to listen to and record your dog's heart rate. We recommend the use of Bluetooth headphones for better sound and generally dog's prefer this but it isn't required to use the app.\n\n**** How It Works ****\n1. Snoopy Dog Heartbeat has been precisely engineered to listen to dog heartbeat sounds, then record and amplify them. \n2. It works best when the dog is lying down and with Airpods or Bluetooth headphones.\n3. Wet your dog's hair around the heart to ensure a good connection with the skin. Remove the case, be in a very quiet room.\n4. Our simple recording management makes it easy.\n5. Take a dog selfie if you wish and share.\n6. Track and monitor your dog's health weekly.\n\n**** Easy Share Feature ****\nYou can opt to share via Facebook, Whats App, Instagram or email to send over to your vet.\n\n**** Before you start... ****\nYou DO need to carefully follow the instructions for Snoopy to work. A quiet room is critical for results as the mic is super-sensitive in the heartbeat range. Snoopy doesn't fake the heartbeat. \n\n**** Supported Phones ****\n13, 13 Max, 12, 12 Max, X, Xs, XR, 11, 11 Pro, 8, 7, 7+, SE, 6s, 6s+, 6, 6+. We don't support iPad. Use the device on Airplane mode.\n\n**** Is it a substitute for medical devices/support? ****\nNo. Under no circumstances is Snoopy a substitute for veterinary consultation. Please consult a professional for any advice. \n\nPlease do check our T&Cs before downloading.\n\nFor results examples: www.facebook.com/snoopydoghealth\n\nDog heart murmurs can be found in all breeds of dog."

      "label": "EMT Academy is a thorough training guide and practice exam for EMT-Basic level EMS personnel. Pass your NREMT certification exam with flying colors, or keep your skills sharp long after you become certified. Written in the style of the NREMT certification exam using scenario-based questions based on current and latest EMS material. \n\nThere are flashcards, and there are flashcards. We’ve been at this since the Palm Pilot! Here are some advanced features that we provide, that set us apart from the competition:\n\n—Questions are revised and updated multiple times per year; you can easily email a question to us for an explanation or comment\n—Search for keywords to review a particular topic\n—Some cards include full color illustrations; most include explanations when helpful\n—Universal app that supports iPhone and iPads, screen rotation, and all the things you expect, including the iPhone 6's\n—Cards can be bookmarked for quick access later\n—You can go back and just look at the questions you missed\n—Advanced score tracking keeps track of your progress daily, weekly, and monthly\n—GAME CENTER support so you can play with friends, compete on leaderboards, and earn achievements\n—There are no in-app purchases required to unlock the “real” app\n\nNOTE: Some people post reviews (instead of emailing us) saying that our CPR is out of date because we mention \"ABC\". Our CPR guidelines clearly follow CAB. However, it's entirely appropriate to use the expression \"check the ABC's\" during assessment and this is widely used in EMS. It has nothing to do with the CPR sequence if that becomes necessary.\n\nWe believe in quality over quantity, yet we still provide OVER 1000 QUALITY MULTIPLE CHOICE QUESTIONS for EMT, with explanations, divided into these chapters:\n\n--PREPARATORY--\nEMS Systems\nSafety & Wellness\nLegal & Ethical Issues\nCommunications\nDocumentation\nThe Human Body\nLifting & Moving\n\n--ASSESSMENT--\nVitals & SAMPLE\nPatient Assessment\n\n--AIRWAY--\n\n--MEDICAL--\nGeneral Pharmacology\nRespiratory Emergencies\nCardiovascular Emergencies\nNeurologic Emergencies\nAcute Abdominal Pain\nDiabetes & AMS\nAllergic Reactions\nToxicology\nBehavioral Emergencies\n\n--TRAUMA--\nTrauma Overview\nBleeding & Shock\nSoft Tissue Injuries\nFace & Neck Injuries\nHead & Spine Injuries\nChest Injuries\nAbdominal Injuries\nMusculoskeletal Injuries\nEnvironmental Emergencies\n\n--SPECIAL POPULATIONS--\nObstetrics & Neonatal\nPediatrics\nGeriatrics\n\n--EMS OPERATIONS--\nTransport Operations\nExtrication & Rescue\nIncident Management\nTerrorism & Disasters\n\n—BLS RESUSCITATION--\n\n--ALS TECHNIQUES--\nAdvanced Airway\n\nTrack your scores and progress along the way. We also provide over 300 \"electronic flashcards\" for another method of learning. \n\nTHAT'S OVER 1300 EMT QUESTIONS! But that's not all. We also include the EMS Toolkit, which many people find just as valuable as the practice questions. Here's what you get in the EMS Toolkit:\n\n• EMS Scenarios - Practice in pairs or small groups with these step by step, ready made scenarios.\n\n• CPR Reference - Updated for latest AHA guidelines using CAB, we provide a reference to the proper steps in CPR, test questions to prepare you for your annual recert, and even a audio metronome that tells you the proper cadence for compressions.\n\n• NREMT Testing Tips - A summary of what you should know before taking the NREMT exam.\n\n• Documentation Guide - Things to consider and document for most common emergencies. Also, a quick reference to those acronyms like OQPRST and DCAP/BTLS.\n\n• NREMT-B Psychomotor Skills Exam - Practical exam checklists for common EMT-B skills so you can make sure you perform every step properly, exactly as spelled out by NREMT.\n\n• EMT-B Skills Guides - We've also added \"how-to\" guides on how to perform key EMT skills like taking Blood Pressure and using an EpiPen.\n\n• NREMT-B Recertification - This tells you what you need to do to recert (number of hours, categories, etc.)"

I bought Chris an iPad  specifically because of your AutoVerbal app. I try to get him to use it when he is having trouble expressing what he is trying to get across as he has almost no speech. There is  potential for this to be a long term major tool to help him. Thanks again, you are doing good work.\"\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n1) Type anything in the text box and touch SPEAK to have it spoken!\n2) Swipe up and down to see different categories of phrases.  Swipe left and right within a category to see phrase options.  Touch the phrase that fits.\n3) The Text Box is a transcript PLUS you can type directly in the box!  It remembers the most recent words/phrases you entered or selected.  Touch the green 'SPEAK' button to have those words spoken!  This allows you to build sentences or repeat a phrase easily.  Touch the X button in the Top Right to clear the transcript.\n4) The TOP ROW/CATEGORY is customizable.  You can customize the text for each button, and with the PRO version, the photos for those buttons.  To do so, first touch HELP then select Custom mode.  Next select a button, replace the text shown (\"Customize\" by default) with your custom text and touch Save Phrase.  To replace a button with a photo from your library (PRO VERSION), while in Custom mode, touch the button then touch the larger version of the button and select a photo from your library.  Touch HELP and User mode to return to user mode.\nNOTE: If you do not hear any sounds, make sure your Volume is all the way up AND you do not have your MUTE switch set.  That is the toggle button above the volume buttons and it applies to apps as well as phone calls.\n\n*Thank you for making us the #1 iPad (#2 iPhone) Medical app, iTunes USA appstore, 6/2010! Unlike the GirlTalk and GuyTalk versions, this PRO app has both MALE and FEMALE voices PLUS it lets you customize the photos for the top row of buttons!\n\nNOTE: U.K. Male and U.S. Female voices are now built-in.  The U.S. Male voice leverages the Internet to create custom text-to-speech.  If the Internet is not available, U.S. Male will resort to the U.K. Male accent."

This professional cognitive training app takes a familiar format for treating left neglect and transforms it into a dynamic, interactive tool for all ages. Visual Attention Therapy offers benefits that can only be achieved through technology: \n\n* Targets must be tapped from left to right, top to bottom in Practice mode, which trains users to slow down and scan the entire screen before they move on.\n* Immediate feedback with visual and auditory cues keeps users engaged.\n* Timed exercises increase motivation to work quickly and accurately.\n* Stop wasting time counting errors! Automated scoring includes data for accuracy by quadrant, time for completion, and mistakes in professional e-mailed reports.\n* Adjustable layouts and 10 levels of difficulty allow you to customize the experience to meet changing needs or multiple users.\n* Sidebar signal can flash in a variety of colors to draw attention to the left or right.\n* An endless variety of combinations eliminates the need to photocopy exercises, with the option to print screenshots when you need a traditional exercise.\n* Use only one target to focus on scanning, or use two targets at once to challenge users with working memory and alternating attention deficits. \n\n-----------\n\nRACE AGAINST THE CLOCK to improve scores while improving cognitive and reading skills. Levels featuring letters can support literacy goals, while symbol-based levels challenge visual memory skills. It’s an occupational therapy dream come true!\n\nVisual Attention Therapy was developed by a certified Speech-Language Pathologist (SLP) and is used worldwide in speech and occupational therapy (OT) to help adults with left neglect after stroke and brain injury. It is also used with children with dyslexia and attentional deficits by reading specialists and neuropsychologists.\n\nDON’T JUST TELL YOUR PATIENTS TO LOOK TO THE LEFT – TRAIN THEM. Modernize your occupational therapy or speech therapy exercises with a left neglect training tool that improves stroke and brain injury rehab. \n\nDOWNLOAD IT NOW!\n\n-----------\n\nLooking for something different in a stroke therapy app?

      "label": "Squeezy has helped thousands of women regain confidence in their pelvic floor. Pelvic health specialists around the world recommend Squeezy to their patients every day because it works.\n\nAround 30,000 people use Squeezy regularly to help them remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises. So if you are thinking about downloading Squeezy for your pelvic floor, you are not alone. \n\nAll women should be doing these exercises and some will be doing them as part of a physiotherapy programme.\n\nSqueezy is simple to use, informative and designed to help women to remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises (also known as Kegel exercises). \n\nFeatures includes:\n• A pre-set exercise plan that follows public health guidelines\n• A record of the number of exercises you have completed, compared to your target\n• Visual and audio guides for exercises\n• Exercise reminders with customisable settings\n• Educational information about the pelvic floor\n• “Professional mode” – if working with a pelvic health specialist, you can tailor the exercise plan to fit your needs\n• A bladder diary to keep track of your symptoms, if required\n• Simple and clear interface\n\nSqueezy has been clinically reviewed and approved by the NHS for its clinical safety, and is compliant with NHS Information Governance requirements.\n\nSqueezy won several industry awards including ehi Awards 2016, Health Innovation Network 2016, National Continence Care Awards 2015/16 and was a finalist for awards including Advancing Healthcare Awards 2014 and 2017, Abbvie Sustainable Healthcare Awards 2016.\n\nFor more about Squeezy and additional pelvic health information visit squeezyapp.com.\n\n*Apple Watch users*\nDuring your exercises you need to hold your finger on your Apple Watch face to keep it live and running. The play button changes to state ‘Hold’ when running an exercise.\n\nThis keeps your Watch from dozing off while your attention is focused on your pelvic floor. Most Watch screens go to sleep after 7 or 15 seconds (time dependent on your Watch settings). Squeezy has no control over the screen sleep time on the Watch; it has to obey your Watch settings. \n\nWe hope to be able to improve the Watch experience in future. In the meantime, we’re continuing the existing Watch support because many people find it helpful.\n\nIf you have feedback on the Apple Watch, please get in touch with the developers directly on help@squeezyapp.com.\n\n\nThis app has been translated into Saudi Arabian Arabic.\nتمت ترجمه هذا التطبيق الى اللغه العربيه ( المملكه العربيه السعوديه)‏"

It will change how you prep for your AEMT certification exam and increase the chance you pass the NREMT the first time.\n\n525 Review questions are broken up into 5 major areas of study: Airway, Oxygen and Ventilation, Cardiology, Trauma, Medical and Operations. Questions in each section will provide a no-nonsense audio rationale by Bill Brown. Use these sections to determine your readiness--and to help focus your study.\n\nWhen you are ready to try a simulated exam we have two, 135-question practice NRAEMT exams to test your overall knowledge and prepare you to take the NRAEMT. Our AEMT PASS Predictive Scoring process can predict if you will pass (or not), based on how well you do on the practice exams.\n\nUnique to the PASS apps is the chance to hear Bill. Throughout the AEMT PASS app, he'll give you tips and tricks for studying for the NREMT and describe what you can expect on the actual test."

The video includes an overview of relevant cardiac anatomy, a step by step presentation of all Transducer Positions, and the sequential transducer movements to acquire standard echo images needed to complete a Transthoracic Echocardiographic Study.\n\nThe cardiac anatomy section visualizes relationships of the heart, ribs, axis of the heart, planes of the heart and aorta, chambers, valves and annuli, and blood flow through the heart.\n\nThe transducer position menu allows the user to view the anatomical landmarks and the transducer positions for left parasternal, apical, subcostal, suprasternal and right parasternal image acquisition.\n\nThe views and imaging menu allows the user to navigate from a particular transducer position menu, such as left parasternal long to specific images acquired within that window, such as PLAX high depth, PLAX low depth, and PLAX Zoom of the Aortic and Mitral Valves. Each animated loop shows a finder image in the upper left that depicts the transducer position, an illustration of the sectional anatomy of the heart on the left, and the echo image with labels on the right."

      "label": "Focus Builder is optimized for use on an iPad.\n\nEye movements are a very powerful way to exercise the brain and to create long-term change in the brain, known as plasticity.  The “Focus Builder” app contains a variety of exercises which challenge users to voluntarily move their eyes in various patterns, speeds and directions, which have been proven to activate specific parts of the brain depending on which eye movement is performed.\n\nThis app is specifically designed for doctors that specialize in Functional Neurology and their patients.  There is currently no app available that can provide these specific exercises.  For best results, patients should consult a Functional Neurologist to determine how to use this app according to their needs and obtain the most therapeutic value.\n\nThere are 3 types of eye movements that can have profound therapeutic benefits and all three are available in this app.  \n1.Pursuits (slow eye movements):  Smooth pursuit eye movements allow the eyes to closely follow a moving object.  Most people are unable to initiate pursuit without a moving visual signal. The pursuit of targets moving with velocities of greater than 30°/s tend to require catch-up saccades.\n2.Saccades (fast eye movements):  Saccades are quick, simultaneous movements of both eyes in the same direction.  Initiated cortically by the frontal eye fields (FEF), or subcortically by the superior colliculus, saccades serve as a mechanism for fixation, rapid eye movement, and the fast phase of optokinetic nystagmus.\n3.Anti-saccades (look away):  The anti-saccade task has emerged as an important task for investigating the flexible control that we have over behavior. In this task, participants must suppress the reflexive urge to look at a visual target that appears suddenly in the peripheral visual field and must instead look away from the target in the opposite direction. A crucial step involved in performing this task is the top-down inhibition of a reflexive, automatic saccade. Patients diagnosed with various neurological and/or psychiatric disorders that affect the frontal lobes or basal ganglia find it difficult to suppress the automatic pro-saccade, revealing a deficit in top-down inhibition.\n\nThe areas of the brain that are activated by these eye movements are too numerous to list, but to name a few, I have listed some of the functions that can improve with these eye exercises.\n1.Executive function/behavior\n2.Attention\n3.Concentration\n4.Impulse control\n5.Social behavior\n6.Motivation\n7.Goal directed behavior"

Tinnitus HQ helps you understand and relieve your tinnitus symptoms.\n\nRecent research shows that tinnitus can be treated by listening to sounds that have been filtered to remove your specific tinnitus frequencies.*\n\nWith Tinnitus HQ, you can apply advanced filters to over 500 high-quality sounds to find relief for your symptoms.\n\nSimply apply a bandpass filter to any sound or mix to isolate frequencies in a narrow range. Move this filter up and down the frequency range until it closely matches the ringing frequency in your ears. \n\nAdd a bandstop filter at these frequencies to any sound or mix to create your tinnitus mask.\n\nThe advanced filters can be applied to both ears or just one ear, and different frequency ranges can be used for each ear.\n\nYou can set a wide range of filter widths from 0.1 to 4.0 octaves, down to 1Hz resolution.\n\nAnd you can adjust the volume level in each ear with a single balance control.\n\nWith Tinnitus HQ you can create advanced natural-sounding tinnitus masks to help relieve your tinnitus symptoms. \n\nTinnitus HQ features:\n\n• Over 500 high-quality natural sound recordings\n• Precision bandpass and bandstop filters to identify and mask ringing frequencies\n• Wide frequency range: 128 Hz to 16 kHz\n• Filter widths from 0.1 to 4.0 Octaves, settable to 1Hz resolution\n• Two-ear and single-ear filtering capability\n• Independent Left-Right ear filter frequencies and widths\n• Left-Right ear volume balance control\n• Easy-to-create blended mixes of any 4 sounds\n• Runs in background while using other apps or when the screen is locked\n• Timer with slow audio fade-out\n• Beautiful high-definition images from around the globe\n• Modern easy-to-use interface\n• 15 different natural sound categories, including Rain, Rivers & Streams, Ocean, Lakes, Wind, Water Fountains, Fire, Birds, Crickets & Insects, Cars, Trains, Public Places, Household, Industrial, Soundscapes.\n\nDownload Tinnitus HQ now.\n\n\n* See http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0138595, http://www.pnas.org/content/107/3/1207.full, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2918775/ for descriptions of notched sound therapy and its positive results.\n\n* Please talk with your doctor about ringing in the ears and any other symptoms.

      "label": "Pregnant? This is for YOU!\nOur leading app allows you to use just your iPhone microphone to record and share your baby’s sounds. It is the best-in-class, has excellent reviews, is super simple and safe to use. Now supports Apple Airpods and Bluetooth Headphones.\n\n\"It took some time and patience... thank you for creating this cheap, awesome technology to use at home.\" - Niki\n\nCategory #1 in the USA and 102 other countries. Here's why...\n\nDeveloped by parents like you (with expertise in sound engineering and app development) who wanted a trustworthy, safe and easy-to-use way to record our baby's fetal sounds (kicks, heartbeat etc.) - and keep a record of a quality that we hadn't been able to find before in other apps. It has been extensively tested on expectant mothers.\n\n\"I was skeptical at first. Great app! Worth it.\" - Legretta \n\n**** But honestly, does it actually work?? ****\nYes. We've sound-engineered ways to attempt to isolate the baby's heart beat, sounds (kicks, heart beat and more) and using an advanced algorithm, amplify them making them easier to detect and hear.\n\nNOTE: It takes time, technique and patience and depends on the position and number of weeks of your baby so you'll need to stick with it. When you do, our results are excellent. Results are best between 27-40 weeks as your baby is bigger and stronger. \n\nWe constantly improve our extensive tutorial and techniques to handhold you through - we even have a support group on Facebook so you can get help.\n\nWe want you to be happy with Hear My Baby heartbeat and getting results can sometimes be difficult.  If you are struggling (can't find your own heartbeat etc. DO contact us via support. We want to help you!\n\nGIFT THIS APP: Click the “Buy App” arrow on the iTunes® App Store\n\n\nFAQs\n\n**** No Accessories Required ****\nWe use the internal microphone from your phone to attempt to listen and record your fetal sound. We recommend Bluetooth Headphones for best results.\n\n**** How It Works ****\n1. Hear My Baby, has been precisely engineered to listen to abdominal sounds, then record and amplify them. Listen to your own heartbeat first to confirm the app is set up correctly. \n2. It works best when baby is head down and their back is facing forwards.\n3. Remove the case, be in a very quiet room and focus on your lower abdomen. Listen then Tap record.\n4. Our simple recording management helps you to keep a record of your special moment\n5. Take a selfie if you wish and share \n6. We'll walk you through exactly how to get the best baby heartbeat results.\n\n**** Easy Share Feature ****\nSharing is awesome you can opt to share via Facebook, Whats App, Instagram or email.\n\n**** We Care About Your Privacy ****\nWe take your privacy and special moment seriously. You decide who sees or hears it and can delete it at any time.\n\n**** Before you start... ****\nYou DO need to carefully follow the instructions for Hear My Baby to work. A quiet room is critical for results as the mic is super sensitive.   HMB doesn't fake the baby heartbeat or other fetal sounds :) \n\nPlease Note: results are normally superb, however the recording may not work if your placenta is at the front of the tummy or the baby is in the wrong position.\n\n**** Supported Phones ****\n13,12, X, Xs, 11, 11 Pro, 8, 7, 7+, SE, 6s, 6s+, 6, 6+ 5c, 5s & 5. We don't support iPad.\n\n**** Worried about safety? We are too! ***\nHMB is safe but to be extra sure DO switch your iPhone to airplane mode. This is a precaution and automatically stops all cellular transmissions.\n\n**** Is it a substitute for medical devices/support? ****\nNo - under no circumstances is HMB a substitute for medical support - if you don't get a result it doesn't mean anything is wrong :) Consult your doctor for any advice. We are NOT approved by the FDA. This is not a medical device and is not a medical baby heartbeat monitor. It is for FUN.\n\nPlease do check our T&Cs before downloading.\n\nFor results examples: www.facebook.com/hearmybaby\nwww.instagram.com/hearmybabyapp"

The guidelines articles, as published in the Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease, as well as the comprehensive risk estimates, can be accessed through https://www.asccp.org/guidelines.  \n\nThese evidence-based management guidelines, initially developed in 2019, came together through a consensus process of 19 organizations. The updated management guidelines aim to:\n • Allow for a more complete and precise estimation of risk\n • Provide more appropriate intervention for high-risk individuals (detect and treat more precancer)\n • Recommend less intervention for low-risk individuals (decrease testing and treatment that won’t prevent cancer and may cause reproductive harm)\n • Allow for the future addition of new risk modifiers and screening and management technologies\n\nSee https://www.asccp.org/UserGuide for tips on using the app."

She will help you relax between surges with a mix of guided relaxations, positive affirmations, gentle music and calming visualisations. Freya makes it easy for you to keep track of your surges and you can visit the log at any point to see how frequently your surges are coming and how long they are lasting. Freya will also let you know when your labour is established and when it might be a good time to contact your midwife. You will never birth alone with Freya by your side.\n \nTRACK YOUR SURGES\n\nIn hypnobirthing we refer to contractions as surges, as a ‘surge’ more accurately describes the sensation you’ll experience when in labour. Freya is the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the app store, designed specifically with hypnobirthing mums in mind, but can be used by anyone.\n \nPREPARE FOR BIRTH\n\nYou can also use Freya in pregnancy to help you relax and prepare for your birth. In fact the more you listen to the guided relaxations and positive affirmations, the more familiar they will become and the more effective they will be at helping you relax when it comes to birth. Positive affirmations have been proven to change the way your mind works and listening regularly will help you feel less anxious and more confident in the lead up to birth. \n \nTHE SCIENCE\n\nWe know the more relaxed you are during birth, the more oxytocin you will produce. Oxytocin helps your uterus to work efficiently, making labour faster and more comfortable. \n \nLIFESKILLS\n\nYou can also use Freya post-birth any time you feel you could benefit from taking some deep breaths or need some help finding your zen. Everything you learn through using Freya - mindfulness exercises, breathing techniques, the benefits of taking time out - are skills for life.\n\nIf you have any questions or spot any pesky bugs lurking about the place (!) please do let us know at help@thepositivebirthcompany.co.uk\n\nWHAT YOU’LL GET:\n\niPhone and Apple Watch app\nA timer to record your surges (also known as a contraction timer)\nCoaching audio to keep your mind focused on breathing through each surge\nA gentle expanding visualisation which you can use to sync your breathing\nA detailed log of your surges over time, so you can track your progress through labour\nAbility to easily share the log with your birth partner, midwife or doula\nGuided relaxations, positive affirmations and soothing visuals to help keep you calm and relaxed, making birth easier, quicker and more straightforward (can also be used in pregnancy and postnatally)\nCoaching created by renowned hypnobirthing expert Siobhan Miller, founder of The Positive Birth Company\n\nDownload the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the App Store and prepare to meet your baby in the best possible way, feeling calm and confident, relaxed and happy!"

All review tests include a detailed written rationale to help you better understand the answer and how to interpret an NREMT style question.\n\nOnce you are ready to test your readiness and challenge your stamina, move on to the two simulated 120-question NREMT exams in the test section.\n\nStill the tough, high-quality questions you have come to expect from Bill Brown, former executive director of the NREMT, the redesigned EMT PASS will prepare you like no other for passing your certification exam."

Using this app is the equivalent to spending hours with the world’s most experienced doctors teaching you about your calcium, parathyroid, osteoporosis, and vitamin D issues. Your tests results are analyzed to determine if a problem exists, what risks are associated, and what to do about it. Beautiful graphs make understanding these problems simple!\n\nBlood tests and bone density scans can be difficult to interpret—even many doctors do not diagnose calcium, vitamin D, and parathyroid problems correctly or timely. Hyperparathyroidism is a disease that affects 1 in 800 people and 1 in 250 women over 50 and is very often overlooked while patients suffer from chronic fatigue, memory loss, depression, osteoporosis, bone pain and many other symptoms. Calcium Pro is a powerful software program that will analyze your calcium health and provide you guidance about the status of your bones, kidneys, parathyroid glands, vitamin D, and other related health issues.\n\nYou start by entering your test results for calcium, parathyroid hormone, and vitamin D. Then we look at your bone density (osteoporosis levels). CalciumPro will analyze and graph your tests making them easy to understand. It will let you know the status of your parathyroid glands and your chance of having hyperparathyroidism. Suggested next steps are given. Tracking tools will show your calcium and vitamin D levels over time, and will show if your bones are losing density (worsening osteoporosis), or gaining bone density. There are important learning tools on every page, and an extensive video and reading library at the end. The app will provide guidance about talking to your physician regarding the possible need for surgery and other important steps.\n\nA Risk Assessment Tool shows your relative risk for conditions associated with high blood calcium: Osteoporosis, Heart Disease, Heart Arrhythmias and Palpitations, High Blood Pressure, Kidney Stones and Kidney Failure, GERD, several Cancers, and others. Watch your risk assessment graphs change as you address your calcium problems. \n\nThis app was developed by doctors at the Norman Parathyroid Center, the world’s leading parathyroid and calcium treatment center using over 4,000,000 data points from over 30,000 patients. Let the world’s leading doctors help you understand these problems so you and your doctor can make important, informed decisions. Take control of your own health!"

      "label": "Make reviewing essential physical therapy academic content enjoyable! Physical Therapist Assistant Content Master is designed to assist physical therapist assistants to possess full command of core academic content. Physical Therapist Assistant Content Master is an ideal tool for physical therapist assistant students, recent physical therapist assistant graduates, and licensed physical therapist assistants.\n\nThe academic content is organized into unique system and non-system categories. \n\nMusculoskeletal System\nNeuromuscular System\nCardiopulmonary System\nOther Systems\nEquipment and Devices\nTherapeutic Modalities\nSafety and Protection\nProfessional Responsibilities\nResearch\n\nPhysical therapist assistants can review selected content by scrolling through subcategories in each of the system and non-system areas. Our innovative design presents academic content in a user-friendly format that allows users to easily digest essential information. Users rate their competence in a variety of topics and create personalized Study Stacks. Study Stacks allow users to efficiently remediate identified academic deficiencies. Frequent review of essential academic content allows users to successfully convert the information to long-term memory. \n\nPhysical Therapist Assistant Content Master includes an assessment mode that consists of 600 multiple-choice questions. Each multiple-choice question has four unique options and an explanation supporting the correct answer. The multiple-choice questions are designed to assess a user’s mastery of the information presented in the content review mode. The number of questions in each category varies from a minimum of 25 to a maximum of 125. Our Content Tag feature allows users to quickly review questions by topic area (i.e., special tests, cranial nerves, pulmonary function tests). \n\nA formal score report describes a physical therapist assistant’s level of mastery cumulatively, by category, and by timeline. Each of the individual reports provides users with valuable performance data to assess their present level of academic mastery. Utilization of the app on a frequent basis considerably strengthens a physical therapist assistant’s knowledge base and provides the necessary foundation to progress to higher level licensing-like questions. \n\nCompany Information\nScorebuilders is a physical therapist owned company whose sole focus is to prepare students for the National Physical Therapy Examinations. We sell more review products and offer more review courses than any other company. Scorebuilders has experienced three decades of continuous growth and is the recognized leader in physical therapy licensing preparation. Scorebuilders offers candidates the knowledge and insight necessary to achieve their goal of becoming a licensed physical therapist assistant on the first attempt.\n\nCopyright © 2019 Scorebuilders\n\nPhysical Therapist Assistant Content Master is the exclusive property of Scorebuilders.

      "label": "Rated 5 stars by nurses and medics alike! Here's what people are saying:\n\nChelsea says: This app is perfect for anyone in the medical field! I'll definitely be using this during my nursing clinicals! Best $4.99 I've spent in a while!\n\nMinifireguy says: \"Easy app to use when on the medic. Easy to open up and get calcs fast. Great app\n\nOmniMedix was created by a practicing street medic with simple design that allows the user to calculate the proper medication infusion rate within seconds instead of fumbling through endless menus. \n\nAgency protocols are different and medications in EMS come and go. OmniMedix is the only calculator based on infusion rates, not specific medications, which allows it to be used with virtually any medication. This allows it the versatility to be used in all clinical environments: EMS, Emergency Department, ICU, medical offices and even veterinary medicine.  \n\nAlso included are weight and temperature conversions, common pediatric calculations, medication bolus calculations, and the Parkland Burn Formula for fluid resuscitation.\n\nWhile most hospital units have IV pumps that take care of the drip rate, most EMS crews don’t, and are either left to calculate drips by hand or \"titrate to effect\". Even if you have the luxury of an IV pump, can you quickly and accurately calculate the correct drip rate by hand if your pump fails? Your patient’s life may depend on it!  This app is a must have for anyone who administers IV medications, and is designed with those who rarely calculate drip rates in mind.\n\nDirections for use: Select the concentration being utilized (mcg/min, mcg/kg/min, etc) to enter its menu. Enter the patient’s weight, the desired dose, medication concentration, and dripset being used. OmniMedix will display the proper flow rate in drops per minute, drops per second, and our proprietary “seconds per drop”, to simplify slower drip rates. \n\nCheck out our YouTube video (search OmniMedix) for a full demo of the app. \n\n\nContent created by: \nCody Blount, BS, NREMT-P, FP-C \n\nSend feedback to: \ninfo@omnimedicsolutions.com"

Physical Therapist Content Master is designed to assist physical therapists to possess full command of core academic content. Physical Therapist Content Master is an ideal tool for physical therapist students, recent physical therapy graduates, and licensed physical therapists.\n\nThe academic content is organized into unique system and non-system categories. \n\nMusculoskeletal System\nNeuromuscular System\nCardiopulmonary System\nOther Systems\nEquipment and Devices\nTherapeutic Modalities\nSafety and Protection\nProfessional Responsibilities\nResearch\n\nPhysical therapists can review selected content by scrolling through subcategories in each of the system and non-system areas. Our innovative design presents academic content in a user-friendly format that allows users to easily digest essential information. Users rate their competence in a variety of topics and create personalized Study Stacks. Study Stacks allow users to efficiently remediate identified academic deficiencies. Frequent review of essential academic content allows users to successfully convert the information to long-term memory. \n\nPhysical Therapist Content Master includes an assessment mode that consists of 750 multiple-choice questions. Each multiple-choice question has four unique options and an explanation supporting the correct answer. The multiple-choice questions are designed to assess a user’s mastery of the information presented in the content review mode. The number of questions in each category varies from a minimum of 25 to a maximum of 175. Our Content Tag feature allows users to quickly review questions by topic area (i.e., special tests, cranial nerves, pulmonary function tests). \n\nA formal score report describes a physical therapist’s level of mastery cumulatively, by category, and by timeline. Each of the individual reports provides users with valuable performance data to assess their present level of academic mastery. Utilization of the app on a frequent basis considerably strengthens a physical therapist’s knowledge base and provides the necessary foundation to progress to higher level licensing-like questions. \n\nCompany Information\nScorebuilders is a physical therapist owned company whose sole focus is to prepare students for the National Physical Therapy Examinations. We sell more review products and offer more review courses than any other company. Scorebuilders has experienced three decades of continuous growth and is the recognized leader in physical therapy licensing preparation. Scorebuilders offers candidates the knowledge and insight necessary to achieve their goal of becoming a licensed physical therapist on the first attempt.\n\nCopyright © 2019 Scorebuilders\n\nPhysical Therapist Content Master is the exclusive property of Scorebuilders.

      "label": "Squeezy has helped thousands of women regain confidence in their pelvic floor. Pelvic health specialists around the world recommend Squeezy to their patients every day because it works.\n\nAround 30,000 people use Squeezy regularly to help them remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises. So if you are thinking about downloading Squeezy for your pelvic floor, you are not alone. \n\nAll women should be doing these exercises and some will be doing them as part of a physiotherapy programme.\n\nSqueezy is simple to use, informative and designed to help women to remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises (also known as Kegel exercises). \n\nFeatures includes:\n• A pre-set exercise plan that follows public health guidelines\n• A record of the number of exercises you have completed, compared to your target\n• Visual and audio guides for exercises\n• Exercise reminders with customisable settings\n• Educational information about the pelvic floor\n• “Professional mode” – if working with a pelvic health specialist, you can tailor the exercise plan to fit your needs\n• A bladder diary to keep track of your symptoms, if required\n• Simple and clear interface\n\nSqueezy has been clinically reviewed and approved by the NHS for its clinical safety, and is compliant with NHS Information Governance requirements.\n\nSqueezy won several industry awards including ehi Awards 2016, Health Innovation Network 2016, National Continence Care Awards 2015/16 and was a finalist for awards including Advancing Healthcare Awards 2014 and 2017, Abbvie Sustainable Healthcare Awards 2016.\n\nFor more about Squeezy and additional pelvic health information visit squeezyapp.com.\n\n*Apple Watch users*\nDuring your exercises you need to hold your finger on your Apple Watch face to keep it live and running. The play button changes to state ‘Hold’ when running an exercise.\n\nThis keeps your Watch from dozing off while your attention is focused on your pelvic floor. Most Watch screens go to sleep after 7 or 15 seconds (time dependent on your Watch settings). Squeezy has no control over the screen sleep time on the Watch; it has to obey your Watch settings. \n\nWe hope to be able to improve the Watch experience in future. In the meantime, we’re continuing the existing Watch support because many people find it helpful.\n\nIf you have feedback on the Apple Watch, please get in touch with the developers directly on help@squeezyapp.com.\n\n\nThis app has been translated into Saudi Arabian Arabic.\nتمت ترجمه هذا التطبيق الى اللغه العربيه ( المملكه العربيه السعوديه)‏"

This app should not be relied upon to make clinical decisions, which remain the full responsibility of the user. Dermatomes are variable between individuals and the pattern of sensory loss is usually less than the entire dermatome, because of overlap.

Program Module Guidelines: Sugar, Temperature, Airway, Blood pressure, Lab work, Emotional support for the family, this app includes a BONUS menu of 22 severe cardiac anomalies to increase understanding of how blood flows through the heart in the setting of ductal dependent and not ductal dependent congenital heart disease (CHD). \n\n- 4 calculators: corrected gestational age, temperature converter (Fahrenheit to Celsius and vice-versa), umbilical artery and venous catheter insertion depth, weight converter (grams to pounds/ounces and vice-versa). \n- Under Cardiac Anomalies you’ll find animations and information on 22 severe forms of congenital heart disease. The MP4 videos demonstrate how blood flows through the heart with the various forms of CHD, and for ductal-dependent lesions, the severe impact of ductal closure on blood flow. Other animations feature normal heart anatomy, hypercyanotic (tet) spell, and balloon atrial septostomy (Rashkind procedure). Also included are illustrations of palliative procedures (PDA stent, balloon valvuloplasty, BT shunt, RVOT stent, central shunt, pulmonary artery band).\n\nSTABLE stands for the 6 assessment and care modules in the program: Sugar, Temperature, Airway, BP, Lab work, Emotional support. This app includes the following items:\n\n- Sugar module: General Guidelines for sick infants and infants at increased risk for hypoglycemia, IV treatment of a blood sugar less than 50 mg/dL (2.8 mmol/L), useful information about umbilical catheters and actions to correct umbilical artery catheter malpositions.\n- Temperature module: General Guidelines (hypothermic classifications, monitoring, rewarming after accidental hypothermia), and neuroprotective hypothermia checklist and neurologic exam.\n- Airway module: monitoring guidelines, respiratory distress descriptions, endotracheal tube sizes and insertion depth, blood gas evaluation, signs of a pneumothorax, and treatment of a pneumothorax.\n- Blood pressure module: assessment for shock and treatment of shock, including how to mix dopamine hydrochloride to constitute an 800 microgram/mL IV fluid solution.\n- Lab work module: risk factors for neonatal infection, clinical signs of infection, and laboratory evaluation prior to transport to an intensive care unit. How to calculate the absolute neutrophil count and immature to total ratio.\n- Emotional support for the family module: the various emotions that parents may be experiencing and how to help families who are experiencing the crisis of a sick newborn.\n\nThe Cardiac Anomalies menu includes short descriptions and MP4 videos and illustrations for:\n\n- Normal Heart and Lungs\n- Aortic Valve Stenosis\n- Atrial septal defect\n- Atrioventricular canal\n- Coarctation of aorta\n- Double outlet right ventricle\n- Ebstein anomaly\n- Hypoplastic left heart syndrome\n- Interrupted aortic arch – type B\n- Patent ductus arteriosus\n- Pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum (IVS)\n- Pulmonary atresia with IVS and sinusoids\n- Pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect\n- Total anomalous pulmonary venous connection (TAPVC) – Cardiac, Supracardiac, Infracardiac)\n- Tetralogy of Fallot (moderate stenosis)\n- Tetralogy of Fallot (ductal dependent)\n- Transposition of the Great Arteries\n- Tricuspid atresia\n- Truncus arteriosus\n- Ventricular septal defect\n\nIncludes illustrations of palliative procedures: balloon atrial septostomy (Rashkind procedure), PDA stent, balloon valvuloplasty, Blalock-Taussig (BT) shunt, right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) stent, central shunt, pulmonary artery band."

A separate device is required.\n\nWhat kind of analysis does iBP provide?\n\niBP uses color icons to indicate when your blood pressure values are normal, high, or hypertension. It also provides interactive graphs that allow you to display your values by weeks, months, year and time of day. The graphs display lows, highs, averages, and trend lines using statistical analysis.\n\nWhy iBP vs. other blood pressure apps?\n\niBP is a universal app designed to work on the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad, which means you only pay for the app once and you get all versions! iBP is the only blood pressure app with a built in transfer capability to sync all your iOS devices.\n\nWhat are the key features?\n\n* Reads and writes Apple Health blood pressure, pulse, and weight data (details below)\n* Easy data input using dials instead of keyboard\n* Transfer capability to sync all of your iOS devices\n* Calculates Mean Arterial Pressure and Pulse Pressure\n* Track one personal item (blood glucose, stress level, medication dosage, exercise time)\n* Backup / Restore capability\n* Multiple users\n* Multiple email addresses (you and doctor)\n* Multiple email formats (PDF, HTML, CSV, Plain Text)\n* Passcode to protect your data\n* Touch Id for passcode on devices that support it\n* Snapshot of the graphs can be saved\n* User configurable color ranges\n* Weight units (lb or kg)\n* Withings Blood Pressure Monitor & Wireless Scale\n\nApple Health\niBP is now able to read and write Apple Health blood pressure, pulse, and weight data. If your blood pressure monitor (i.e., Omron, iHealth, Withings) adds data to Apple Health then you can easily import that data into this app. If you manually input your data into this app, then it will write that data to Apple Health.\n\nWithings + iBP = No more data entry!\niBP can retrieve your blood pressure and weight data directly from your Withings account.  The Blood Pressure Monitor and wireless Body Scale automatically record and send the data to your account.  There is no data entry required and you can view the data anywhere using a web browser or a variety of mobile apps.\n\n\nDisclaimer: iBP is intended to be used as a means to collect data to be shared with your doctor. This application is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

This app will evaluate your resuscitation skills better than reviewing with a book because you have to diagnose the rhythms as they dynamically move across the screen.\n\nThe app utilizes an organized four Criteria approach to identify the rhythms. You can also study the Description of the rhythm to review the electrophysiology. Use the same process to test yourself and review all the ECG rhythms.\n\nWhen you feel you have mastered the rhythms in this program you should review the American Heart Association Advanced Cardiac Life Support algorithms using the app Anesoft 'ACLS Sim 2016'."

It is a universal app running on iPhone and iPad devices. \n\nResources include algorithms commonly used to localize arrhythmia substrates and reference guides to assist in the identification of clinical conditions involving abnormalities of cardiac rhythm. Algorithms are implemented via an intuitive user interface. These algorithms guide the user through a series of questions to arrive at an answer while providing a graphical visualization of their progress and result of their analysis.  \n\nUse of the save path to image feature allows users to save an image of the current decision path when using many of the decision analysis tools included. These images, which appear in the photo album, may be useful to communicate findings with colleagues. \n\nUsers may access scientific reference material cited in the app.  Many of the references are available for free or are easily accessible by subscription holders.  \n\nLocalize accessory pathways using algorithms of Arruda, Milstein, Taguchi , D'Avila, Li, Pambrun, Baek and Crionon et al and differentiate WPW from FVF using O'Leary et al.\n\nLocalization of atrial tachycardias: Algorithms provided (based on Ellenbogen et al and Kistler et al) assist in the localization of ATs from 12-lead electrocardiogram. The De Ponti et al tool calculates the appropriate mapping window to identify the isthmus of an AT. The Miyazaki et al tool localizes macro reentrant ATs based on pacing responses.\n\nTools to assist with diagnosis of preexcitation variants, J-wave syndromes and entrainment site localization are included.\n\nLocalization of ischemic ventricular tachycardia: Three algorithms are provided (based on Miller et al, Segal et al and Andreu et al) to assist in the localization of exit sites for ventricular tachycardia in the setting of single and multiple myocardial infarction based on findings on 12-lead electrocardiograms during ventricular tachycardia. \n\nLocalization of idiopathic ventricular tachycardia and premature ventricular contractions via ECG findings:  The Ito,Park  and Enriquez et al algorithms assist in the localization of ventricular ectopic activity and tachycardia. 8 tools are provided to differentiate right from left ventricular (aortic cusp) outflow tract arrhythmias via calculation of the QRS-RVA Interval the  V₂S/V₃R Index, TZ Index, V₂ Transition ratio and the R/S-wave Amplitude, R-Wave Duration, R-wave amplitude, V₂QRSI40  and RV₁-₃ indices.\n\n2 tools are provided to differentiate endocardial from epicardial VTs (calculation of the MDI, Daniels et al and the Berruezo criteria).\n\nDisease Assessment: Consensus criteria for ARVD/C and Short QT Syndrome.  5-yr risk of SCD in HCM (O'Mahon et al)and LQTS (1-2-3-LQTS-Risk), inadequate DFT safety margin (Hsu et al ), LA arrhythmogenic substrate (Kosiuk et al, D'Ambrosio et al), 30-day mortality after PPM and ICD lead extraction (Brunner et al), 1-4 year mortality in  1° prevention ICD placement (Bilchick et al, SHOCKED), Shanghai score (Brugada Syndrome),  VT prediction in ARVD/C (Cadrin-Tourigny et al.), Suspicious Index In Lyme Carditis (SILC), PADIT infection and ABC-VT Risk Score calculators are provided.\n\nA CIED/electrocautery manager is included. Detailed preoperative plans can be created and shared by text or email.\n\nA clinical guidelines and consensus statement resource is provided.\n \nTools to differentiate SVT from VT using  12-lead electrocardiogram features utilizing the Brugada, Verckei and Moccetti et al algorithms.\n\nTools for CHADS₂, CHA₂DS₂VASc  and ATRIA stroke risk, HAS-BLED bleeding risk scores, QT correction heart rate (Bazett or Fredericia, Hodges) and left bundle branch block (Bogosian and Yankelson et al)  and a CL to bpm interconverter are provided. \n\nReference examples using the included tools are available on our website (www.busy-being-born.com/examples)."

It is a specific brain stimulation which is rarely used in conjunction with other treatments but can be used as a portion of a home-based program or an office-based program. Such usage may lead to improved hemispheric connectivity specific, targeted areas of the brain and its connections to the parietal/temporal or frontal cortices.\n\nHemistim provides a visual stimulation through utilizing color patterns and eye tracking that can be used for specific left or right visual exercise. The stimulus is recognized and  interpreted by the contralateral (opposite) occipital lobe. Pursuit and saccadic eye movements are created by targeting on the moving object. Pursuit away from and saccade towards the alternating squares are initiated by the ipsilateral (same side) parietal and frontal cortex, respectively.  This gives the doctor the ability to work the frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal lobes hemispherically. \n\nHemStim is easy to use.\n\nSwipe left or right to select a different colored pattern.  Multiple patterns are available.\n\nTap a pattern to make it begin blinking.  The pattern will blink until the timer stops it.\nDouble tapping the pattern will also make it stop.\n\nThe blink rate and timer can be changed using the sliders.\n\nTarget motion is controlled by the tapping the small target to the right of the speed control.  Choose among no motion, saccade, and pursuit by successive taps on the small target.  Exterior motion is indicated by purple arrows on the target and interior motion by white arrows.\n\nThe new Saccades screen only displays target motion. \n\nDrag the purple target with one finger to set the direction and length of its motion. \n\nTap the screen once simultaneously with two fingers to switch between saccades, a dashed line, and pursuits, a solid line. \n\nTap the screen once with one finger to start the saccades or pursuits. \n\nDouble tap the screen with one finger to stop the target motion.\n\nHemiStim automatically tracks therapy sessions, recording all pertinent information about each one.  Maintain close communication between clinician and patient via email."

      "label": "Choose This Not That for Ulcers. Inside this colorful app, you will find easy to follow suggestions on how to improve your health through nutrition and the food choices you make every day. This app provides comprehensive and actionable nutrition guidelines for how to reduce your risk, prevent and combat Ulcers (Peptic Ulcer). If you rather tackle health issues and risks through proper nutrition and lifestyle changes then this app is for you!\n\nA number of powerful, unique and interactive features make this app so different and superior to others in the market:\n\n• Is this food good for me? This feature answers the common question about suitability of various food items for your personal situation. And it does so in an easy to understand and colorful graphic form.\n\n• Health issues often come our way in groups of two or more. They are often caused by other health complications or result in other illnesses and risks. It is for that reason, that we have included separate guidelines for those who might be at risk with any of the following common conditions along with Ulcers: Anemia (iron deficiency), Cancer risk, Depression, Diabetes, Excess body weight or Obesity, High blood pressure, High cholesterol, Menopause, Stress, and Vitamin D deficiency.\n\n• Top-5 recommendations on what to eat/do, and what not to.\n\n• Food Suggestions. The best food choices within a food group, based on your personal profile. An extremely valuable tool when at restaurants or when grocery shopping. Also included are suggestions on appropriate life style choices, alternative therapies and herbal remedies, when such options are promising and available to you.\n\n• ACTIONABLE information on what is good, what is bad, and what is neutral for your condition(s). We single out specific food items, and give you an ordered list of helpful and harmful foods within each food group. \n\nSuggestions presented in this app are based on the content licensed from Personal Remedies, LLC. The primary sources used by Personal Remedies are US government sources such as USDA (US Department of Agriculture), NIH (National Institute of Health) agencies, and leading clinics & universities.\n\nPersonal Remedies is the publisher of the largest collection of health and nutrition apps for chronic conditions in the market. It is based in metro-Boston, home to the highest ranking healthcare providers and academic institutions in the world.\n\nThis app is updated by our team on an ongoing basis. Updates happen seamlessly, and do NOT require frequent inconvenient downloads.\n\n“This technology was developed using the most current clinical evidence-based information that is available in the US. Behind this technology there is a team of expert clinicians, scientists, endocrinologists, oncologists, and other specialists who are passionate about bridging the gap between expert knowledge and the patient.“ \nKatya Tsaioun, PhD, Nutrition, Tufts University; L.D.N.\n\n “Proper nutrition and other alternative treatments show great promise in preventing and treating many of the illnesses that we deal with every day. I encourage all my patients to follow appropriate nutrition and research other options for themselves. The Choose This Not That series are an excellent step towards improving people’s knowledge in this area.”\nShahin Tabatabaei, MD\nMass General Hospital; Harvard Medical School\n\n“The Choose This Not That series of apps provide dietary recommendations focused on common chronic health problems. They are easy to understand and thus easy to implement into daily life. Most doctors would find it difficult to discuss dietary recommendations at the level of detail found in the series. They should serve as a valuable complement in helping people manage chronic illnesses through dietary and lifestyle modifications.”\nAndrew S. Lenhardt, MD \nLahey Clinic, Beverly, MA"

      "label": "AccuGo eases the day to day management of the HCU diet by providing a quick and easy way to estimate and track protein or methionine in foods eaten.\n\nHomocystinuria (HCU) is an inherited condition which affects the way a person’s body uses methionine (from which homocystine is made).  A person with HCU cannot breakdown the methionine in food, which causes methionine, and in turn homocystine, to build up in the blood. High levels of homocystine and methionine build up in the body and lead to progressive disorders of the central nervous system (CNS), ocular, skeletal, and cardiovascular system.  Symptoms include mental retardation, dislocation of the lens of the eye resulting in blindness if untreated, seizures, osteoporosis, heart attack and stroke.  As a whole, the complications of the disease lead to a reduced quality of life and significantly shorter life expectancy.\n\nAccuGo for HCU is sponsored by HCU Network Australia.\n\nFeatures:\n - track Methionine or Protein by changing mode in Options\n - online synchronization of food records between multiple devices\n - track up to four different individuals\n - continues to work offline, anywhere regardless of wifi or cellular availability\n - overview of day's running total of protein or methionine and calories at a glance\n - groups foods eaten together by selectable time periods (15mins, 1 hour, etc)\n - copy/move/delete entries with ease\n - built in calendar for easy navigation\n - jump to the past to see historical entries\n - Historical graph shows totals over the past month\n - jump to the future to plan menus in advance\n - supports inline math calculations (eg. 1/3 + 1/8)\n - round values up or down with a simple swipe\n - automatic real-time calculation of quantity/methionine/Protein/calories as you type\n - includes pre-loaded & searchable hand-picked USDA-based food items\n - add your own foods and values to the database\n - Community Food List provides shared items you can add to your personal food list, or share yours with the community\n - email daily food records by date range, includes summary of average over the range"

      "label": "This app is intended for obstetricians, midwives, and nurses who use electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) in laboring patients.   In addition to interpreting fetal heart rate (FHR) tracings, health care professionals must communicate with each other about the tracings in a way that is understood by all parties, and decide what action to take.\n\nFHR 5-tier is based on the five-color system developed by Drs. Julian Parer and Tomoaki Ikeda.  (AJOG July 2007) The intent of their system is to standardize management of different fetal heart rate tracings. The system divides all fetal heart rate tracings into one of five categories:  Green (no acidemia, no intervention required), Blue, Yellow, Orange or Red (evidence of actual or impending fetal asphyxia, rapid delivery recommended).   Each color has assigned to it a:  a) risk of acidemia, b) risk of evolution to a more serious pattern and c) recommended action.\n\nThe NICHD three-tier system of classifying fetal heart rate (FHR) tracings has been criticized for having too wide a range of tracings in “Category II”. Some researchers and clinicians believe that the five-tier color-coded system more effectively classifies EFM tracings.  The five-tier system is being adopted by an increasing number of hospitals in the U.S. and in Japan.\n\nFHR 5-tier makes it easier to use the five-color system.\n\nWithout the FHR 5-tier app, one must refer to a table with 134 possible combinations of variability, baseline, and decelerations.  One must also either memorize or refer to the definitions for mild, moderate and severe decelerations, which are complex and sometimes confusing.\n\nWhen using the FHR 5-tier app it is not necessary to refer to any other table or chart. Variability and baseline, and the shape, nadir, and duration of decelerations are entered with buttons on the consecutive screens. The app calculates the severity of the deceleration and the color for each tracing.  All aspects of the tracing are summarized on the colored results screen, so that the user can quickly communicate with others.\n\nManagement recommendations as outlined by Parer and Ikeda are given. These include whether or not the obstetrician needs to be at the bedside; what other personnel should be available; and whether the patient should be moved to the operating room.  In addition, conservative management techniques are listed where appropriate.  Thus, for Blue, Yellow, and Orange tracings, the final results screen reminds the user to consider actions such as maternal position change, decreasing oxytocin, or amnioinfusion.  \n\nAs noted by Parer and Ikeda, the guidelines for management may need to be modified for institutions other then theirs, and may even change depending on time of day.\n\nThe NICHD Category (I, II, III) is also given on the results screen.\n\n This application is intended as a reference tool for use only by licensed healthcare professionals.  This application is not a substitute for each licensed healthcare professional's independent clinical judgment.  No medical decision should be based solely on information obtained by use of this tool.  \n\n\nThis application tries to faithfully aggregate information from major authorities (see references) and does not introduce or substitute the judgment of the makers of this application for those authorities.

We’ve taken all the content from our original Pedi STAT application and carefully selected components that are unique to providers in EMS.  We’ve solicited feedback from leaders in out of hospital care, including paramedics, EMTs, air medical flight crews, and medical directors. We’ve condensed the content to be applicable to those providing care outside the hospital, including first responders, firefighters, EMTs, Paramedics, and Critical Care Transport providers.\n\nMedication dosing and pediatric equipment sizes are easily and rapidly accessed, and accurately calculated based on provider input of either weight, length, age, or Broselow / Pediatape weight estimates.  We are attempting to eliminate medical errors by calculating not only the correct pediatric medication dose, but also the volume to be administered for patient specific conditions.  We have also included algorithms and medical calculators to assist providers in multiple areas, including managing pediatric cardiac arrest, burn size estimation and fluid resuscitation, and Glasgow Coma Scale.\n\nCaring for pediatric patients is associated with a large number of challenges, the most important being selecting the correct equipment and medications, and then dosing the medications correctly.  Our goal is to eliminate these challenges as much as possible, and allow the provider to concentrate on what is most important, the patient.\n\nSuggestions for improvements or additions are always welcome:  Pedi-STAT.com"

It will help you receive more money every month from the VA for your injuries and help you document your injuries and treatment.\n\nThis app is not just a calculator, it will tell you what information you need to provide (based on your selected injuries/diagnoses) and allow you to document and save the information in order to receive the most compensation for your injuries and illnesses.  It allows you to document your injuries, symptoms, doctor visits, episodes and medications.  It helps you save and organize the information in a secure encrypted database. When you are ready for your VA interview, email all of your injuries with your documentation to yourself or the VA.  If you don't provide documentation to the VA, you may not receive the full compensation for your injuries or illnesses.  It works completely offline, without an internet connection.\n\nThe VA will rely on YOU to provide them with all of the medical information that is pertinent to the injury you are claiming.  They cannot not look through your medical records for you.\n\n** Active duty personnel - Download it before you deploy!\n\n**  Use it to track injuries, and care given for you or your battle buddy.  Everything in the app is self contained so it works when you are not connected to the internet.\n\n** Veterans - My VA Benefits tells you how get a copy of your medical records from the Department of Defense (DoD) and the VA.  It also helps you request your medical records using the Freedom Of Information Act (FOIA).\n\n** If you cannot find your diagnosis, let us know and we will research if for you.  Just submit your question to our forum at our website: http://myvabenefits.us/\n\n**Submit questions to our forum: http://myvabenefits.us/index.php/forum/index \n\n** We provide free updates for the app with the latest codes and rate tables when the VA releases them.\n\n** If you encounter an issue with the app, do not uninstall it or you may lose your data.  Just contact us at http://myvabenefits.us and we will fix it.\n\n** For Back injuries see code 5320 or search for \"spine\".\n\n** For Hearing loss, you cannot self-diagnose because \"An examination for hearing impairment for VA purposes must be conducted by a state-licensed audiologist and must include a controlled speech discrimination test (Maryland CNC) and a puretone audiometry test. Examinations will be conducted without the use of hearing aids.\""

There is  a complete list of select-able Diagnostic Tips (H's and T's) and recommended medication and non-medication treatment solutions. CARMA is an invaluable, portable tool for healthcare professionals in the resuscitation of patients experiencing cardiopulmonary arrest.\n \nCARMA includes an audible CPR metronome which defaults to 100 beats/minute, and timers for Epinephrine, Amniodarone and code duration. The duration timer prompts the leader to reevaluate every 30 minutes. Each timer has a unique vibrate feature when it completes its  cycle. All of CARMA's timer durations, rates and audible features are configurable through CARMA's preferences menu.\n\nCARMA also features a logging process that automatically tracks all activities within a session.  They include timer starts and stops, H's and T's selections, rhythm, medication and non-drug intervention selections.  Each event is time stamped for easy review.  In addition, the session log can be easily emailed for archiving purposes.  In conformance with HIPAA requirements, no patient information is stored in the log and the log does not reside in the physical space of the mobile device.  Once the application exits or is reset, the log is deleted.\n \nCARMA is an  ACLS tool which gives healthcare providers the ability to better manage cardio-pulmonary events. It guides the provider through ACLS protocols in real time at the bedside utilizing the 2014 American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines, leading to better outcomes.\n \n\nFor more information visit\nwww.carmaforlife.com"

      "label": "\"Love This App!\" \"Very Useful!\" \"Perfect!\" \"So Easy to Use!\" \"Great for my patients!\"\nSee why thousands of users around the world are raving about this app!\n\nPeople with memory impairments can become worried when they don't remember where they are or other important information. They may be unsafe when they forget to use a walker or apply the wheelchair breaks before standing. All of these facts and procedures can be engrained into memory using a repetitive and effective memory training procedure.\n\nThis Spaced Retrieval Therapy app uses the scientifically-proven method of spaced retrieval training to help people with dementia or other memory impairments to recall important information. Recalling an answer over multiplying intervals of time, such as 1 minute, 2 minutes, 8 minutes, and so on, helps to cement the information in memory.\n\nSpaced Retrieval Therapy is an enhanced interval timer with independent data tracking and prompts. It automatically increases the time between prompts with correct responses and decreases it with incorrect ones. This app will help clinicians, family members, and students keep track of the intervals and performance as they practice up to 3 memory targets.\n\n*Put away your stopwatch and paper - this app is all you need!\n\n*Keeps track of expanding intervals and data so you don't have to\n\n*Works in the background while doing other therapy exercises or using other apps\n\n*Subtle sound and visual prompts let you know it’s time to ask again\n\n*Tracks accuracy and data automatically, & emails you the finished report\n\n\n\"5 Stars - This app is a fantastic inclusion into my therapy toolbox. It is very useful in therapy and helps me keep track patient progress more efficiently.\" - App Store Review\n\n\nSpeech-Language Pathologists, Occupational Therapists, Neuropsychologists, Teachers, Social Workers, and families can all use this simple technique & app to help clients and loved ones remember important information (names, safety procedures, orientation information, etc).\n\nRecommended by top experts in memory training and dementia therapy, Spaced Retrieval Therapy will make your life easier and your therapy more efficient.\n\n\n\"***** Very Useful!  I found this app to be extremely useful during therapy sessions. When juggling multiple activities it can be difficult to remember to cue a patient for each specific interval. This app makes spaced retrieval an easy way to incorporate prospective and short term memory tasks into treatment.\" - SLP on App Store Review\n\n\nVisit our website at http://tactustherapy.com/app/srt/ to link to several articles about this technique and its proven efficacy with dementia, aphasia, normal learners, and more. \n\n\nThis app is also available as part of the Tactus Complete Therapy Toolkit and Tactus Cognitive Therapy Toolkit discount bundles for iPad users.\n\n\nPlease note: This app is a timer and tracks data.  Targets should be individually selected for the memory-impaired person to be relevant and meaningful.  This app is not intended to be used alone by the memory-impaired person, but as a therapy tool by a clinician or family member trained in this technique."

You will discover if it has become melanoma, that’s a malignant mole, or if it’s benign.\nA skin cancer self exam is used to identify suspicious moles or lesions that may be cancer or growths that may develop into skin cancer (precancers). Individuals who are at a high risk of skin cancer are encouraged to perform frequent skin self exams. It is explained, within the app, how to track and review the moles and lesions.\nWhen it comes to Skin Cancer, there is a lot of information out there and it's very hard to be sure you're making the right decisions. That's where this app becomes more and more useful. By using Artificial Intelligence, we can help take some of the guesswork out of your condition. \n\nSkin cancer is the most prevalent type of cancer. Melanoma, specifically, is responsible for 75% of skin cancer deaths, despite being the least common skin cancer. The American Cancer Society estimates over 100,000 new melanoma cases were diagnosed in 2020.\n\nSource datasets: \nAs the leading healthcare organization for informatics in medical imaging, the Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine (SIIM)'s mission is to advance medical imaging informatics through education, research, and innovation in a multi-disciplinary community. SIIM is joined by the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC), an international effort to improve melanoma diagnosis.

      "label": "This App was designed specifically to help those in the medical field as well as individuals who deal with wounds on a daily basis. It is meant to replace the need for using unsanitary paper rulers and other unsanitary means of measuring the width, height, and depth of a wound on a patient or yourself. This saves you not only the cost of a separate measuring device each time a wound is measured, but also helps to reduce the chance of infection that can come from touching a measurement device to an open wound. \n\nWith the Wound Measurement App, you can measure a wound opening one-handed, reducing some of the problems that can come with measuring a wound in a difficult spot. Once the measurements are complete, a label with appear above the wound with the measurements and you can save a picture of both the measurements and the opening all at the same time, saving you time and effort. \n\nUsers now have the ability to add patient information to the label including Patient ID, Patient Name, and Wound Location. The date and time appear on the label automatically to help you keep track of when a measurement was taken.\n\nWe respect the privacy of our users and their patients. We cannot and will not access the camera or photos remotely. Please note that the app will need to be allowed to use your phone’s camera only to take the measurements, and it will need to be allowed to save a photo to the photos library. If you do not wish to keep a photo, you can always go to your photos library and delete anything you don't want to keep. We also don’t collect or ask for any information from the user, we feel that your apps and information belong to you, and that you should have complete control of your privacy.\n\nLike most people, we don’t like having to see adds all over the place, so we don’t use any adds in this app. \n\nFeatures List:\n-Simple to use, with easy access to instructions.\n-Easy, one-handed operation.\n-Augmented Reality, tested for accuracy.\n-Does not require internet or cellular connection to take measurements or save photos.\n-Sanitary - nothing touches the wound.\n-In poor lighting conditions, the flashlight can be turned on from within the App.\n-Allows you to track the healing process easily and visually through photos saved from the App.\n-Users can add information to the wound label (Patient ID, Patient Name, Wound Location).\n-Date and time now automatically appear on the wound label to help you keep track of the healing progress.\n-Light or Dark mode\n\nCompatible with iOS devices from iPhone 7 and up.\n\nFor the best results in Augmented Reality, keep the phone perpendicular to the surface you want to measure."

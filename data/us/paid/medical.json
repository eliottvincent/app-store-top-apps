      "label": "Pregnant? This is for YOU!\nOur leading app allows you to use just your iPhone microphone to record and share your baby’s sounds. It is the best-in-class, has excellent reviews, is super simple and safe to use. Now supports Apple Airpods and Bluetooth Headphones.\n\n\"It took some time and patience... thank you for creating this cheap, awesome technology to use at home.\" - Niki\n\nCategory #1 in the USA and 102 other countries. Here's why...\n\nDeveloped by parents like you (with expertise in sound engineering and app development) who wanted a trustworthy, safe and easy-to-use way to record our baby's fetal sounds (kicks, heartbeat etc.) - and keep a record of a quality that we hadn't been able to find before in other apps. It has been extensively tested on expectant mothers.\n\n\"I was skeptical at first. Great app! Worth it.\" - Legretta \n\n**** But honestly, does it actually work?? ****\nYes. We've sound-engineered ways to attempt to isolate the baby's heart beat, sounds (kicks, heart beat and more) and using an advanced algorithm, amplify them making them easier to detect and hear.\n\nNOTE: It takes time, technique and patience and depends on the position and number of weeks of your baby so you'll need to stick with it. When you do, our results are excellent. Results are best between 27-40 weeks as your baby is bigger and stronger. \n\nWe constantly improve our extensive tutorial and techniques to handhold you through - we even have a support group on Facebook so you can get help.\n\nWe want you to be happy with Hear My Baby heartbeat and getting results can sometimes be difficult.  If you are struggling (can't find your own heartbeat etc. DO contact us via support. We want to help you!\n\nGIFT THIS APP: Click the “Buy App” arrow on the iTunes® App Store\n\n\nFAQs\n\n**** No Accessories Required ****\nWe use the internal microphone from your phone to attempt to listen and record your fetal sound. We recommend Bluetooth Headphones for best results.\n\n**** How It Works ****\n1. Hear My Baby, has been precisely engineered to listen to abdominal sounds, then record and amplify them. Listen to your own heartbeat first to confirm the app is set up correctly. \n2. It works best when baby is head down and their back is facing forwards.\n3. Remove the case, be in a very quiet room and focus on your lower abdomen. Listen then Tap record.\n4. Our simple recording management helps you to keep a record of your special moment\n5. Take a selfie if you wish and share \n6. We'll walk you through exactly how to get the best baby heartbeat results.\n\n**** Easy Share Feature ****\nSharing is awesome you can opt to share via Facebook, Whats App, Instagram or email.\n\n**** We Care About Your Privacy ****\nWe take your privacy and special moment seriously. You decide who sees or hears it and can delete it at any time.\n\n**** Before you start... ****\nYou DO need to carefully follow the instructions for Hear My Baby to work. A quiet room is critical for results as the mic is super sensitive.   HMB doesn't fake the baby heartbeat or other fetal sounds :) \n\nPlease Note: results are normally superb, however the recording may not work if your placenta is at the front of the tummy or the baby is in the wrong position.\n\n**** Supported Phones ****\n13,12, X, Xs, 11, 11 Pro, 8, 7, 7+, SE, 6s, 6s+, 6, 6+ 5c, 5s & 5. We don't support iPad.\n\n**** Worried about safety? We are too! ***\nHMB is safe but to be extra sure DO switch your iPhone to airplane mode. This is a precaution and automatically stops all cellular transmissions.\n\n**** Is it a substitute for medical devices/support? ****\nNo - under no circumstances is HMB a substitute for medical support - if you don't get a result it doesn't mean anything is wrong :) Consult your doctor for any advice. We are NOT approved by the FDA. This is not a medical device and is not a medical baby heartbeat monitor. It is for FUN.\n\nPlease do check our T&Cs before downloading.\n\nFor results examples: www.facebook.com/hearmybaby\nwww.instagram.com/hearmybabyapp"

Around 75% of people with IBS experience symptom relief on a low FODMAP diet.\n\nThe app comes directly from the research team at Monash and includes the following:\n\n- General information about the FODMAP diet and IBS.\n- Easy to understand tutorials to guide you through the app and the 3-Step FODMAP diet.\n- A Food Guide detailing the FODMAP content for hundreds of foods using a simple 'traffic light system'. \n- A list of branded products that have been certified by Monash as low FODMAP.\n- A collection of over 70 nutritious, low FODMAP recipes.\n- Functions that allow you to create your own shopping list and add notes to individual foods\n- A Diary that enables you to record food eaten, IBS symptoms, bowel habits and stress levels. The Diary will also guide you through step 2 of the diet - FODMAP reintroduction.\n- The ability to adjust units of measurement (metric or imperial) and activate colour blindness assistance."

The guidelines articles, as published in the Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease, as well as the comprehensive risk estimates, can be accessed through https://www.asccp.org/guidelines.  \n\nThese evidence-based management guidelines, initially developed in 2019, came together through a consensus process of 19 organizations. The updated management guidelines aim to:\n • Allow for a more complete and precise estimation of risk\n • Provide more appropriate intervention for high-risk individuals (detect and treat more precancer)\n • Recommend less intervention for low-risk individuals (decrease testing and treatment that won’t prevent cancer and may cause reproductive harm)\n • Allow for the future addition of new risk modifiers and screening and management technologies\n\nSee https://www.asccp.org/UserGuide for tips on using the app."

She will help you relax between surges with a mix of guided relaxations, positive affirmations, gentle music and calming visualisations. Freya makes it easy for you to keep track of your surges and you can visit the log at any point to see how frequently your surges are coming and how long they are lasting. Freya will also let you know when your labour is established and when it might be a good time to contact your midwife. You will never birth alone with Freya by your side.\n \nTRACK YOUR SURGES\n\nIn hypnobirthing we refer to contractions as surges, as a ‘surge’ more accurately describes the sensation you’ll experience when in labour. Freya is the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the app store, designed specifically with hypnobirthing mums in mind, but can be used by anyone.\n \nPREPARE FOR BIRTH\n\nYou can also use Freya in pregnancy to help you relax and prepare for your birth. In fact the more you listen to the guided relaxations and positive affirmations, the more familiar they will become and the more effective they will be at helping you relax when it comes to birth. Positive affirmations have been proven to change the way your mind works and listening regularly will help you feel less anxious and more confident in the lead up to birth. \n \nTHE SCIENCE\n\nWe know the more relaxed you are during birth, the more oxytocin you will produce. Oxytocin helps your uterus to work efficiently, making labour faster and more comfortable. \n \nLIFESKILLS\n\nYou can also use Freya post-birth any time you feel you could benefit from taking some deep breaths or need some help finding your zen. Everything you learn through using Freya - mindfulness exercises, breathing techniques, the benefits of taking time out - are skills for life.\n\nIf you have any questions or spot any pesky bugs lurking about the place (!) please do let us know at help@thepositivebirthcompany.co.uk\n\nWHAT YOU’LL GET:\n\niPhone and Apple Watch app\nA timer to record your surges (also known as a contraction timer)\nCoaching audio to keep your mind focused on breathing through each surge\nA gentle expanding visualisation which you can use to sync your breathing\nA detailed log of your surges over time, so you can track your progress through labour\nAbility to easily share the log with your birth partner, midwife or doula\nGuided relaxations, positive affirmations and soothing visuals to help keep you calm and relaxed, making birth easier, quicker and more straightforward (can also be used in pregnancy and postnatally)\nCoaching created by renowned hypnobirthing expert Siobhan Miller, founder of The Positive Birth Company\n\nDownload the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the App Store and prepare to meet your baby in the best possible way, feeling calm and confident, relaxed and happy!"

You will discover if it has become melanoma, that’s a malignant mole, or if it’s benign.\nA skin cancer self exam is used to identify suspicious moles or lesions that may be cancer or growths that may develop into skin cancer (precancers). Individuals who are at a high risk of skin cancer are encouraged to perform frequent skin self exams. It is explained, within the app, how to track and review the moles and lesions.\nWhen it comes to Skin Cancer, there is a lot of information out there and it's very hard to be sure you're making the right decisions. That's where this app becomes more and more useful. By using Artificial Intelligence, we can help take some of the guesswork out of your condition. \n\nSkin cancer is the most prevalent type of cancer. Melanoma, specifically, is responsible for 75% of skin cancer deaths, despite being the least common skin cancer. The American Cancer Society estimates over 100,000 new melanoma cases were diagnosed in 2020.\n\nSource datasets: \nAs the leading healthcare organization for informatics in medical imaging, the Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine (SIIM)'s mission is to advance medical imaging informatics through education, research, and innovation in a multi-disciplinary community. SIIM is joined by the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC), an international effort to improve melanoma diagnosis. The ISIC Archive contains the largest publicly available collection of quality-controlled dermoscopic images of skin lesions.

Using this app is the equivalent to spending hours with the world’s most experienced doctors teaching you about your calcium, parathyroid, osteoporosis, and vitamin D issues. Your tests results are analyzed to determine if a problem exists, what risks are associated, and what to do about it. Beautiful graphs make understanding these problems simple!\n\nBlood tests and bone density scans can be difficult to interpret—even many doctors do not diagnose calcium, vitamin D, and parathyroid problems correctly or timely. Hyperparathyroidism is a disease that affects 1 in 800 people and 1 in 250 women over 50 and is very often overlooked while patients suffer from chronic fatigue, memory loss, depression, osteoporosis, bone pain and many other symptoms. Calcium Pro is a powerful software program that will analyze your calcium health and provide you guidance about the status of your bones, kidneys, parathyroid glands, vitamin D, and other related health issues.\n\nYou start by entering your test results for calcium, parathyroid hormone, and vitamin D. Then we look at your bone density (osteoporosis levels). CalciumPro will analyze and graph your tests making them easy to understand. It will let you know the status of your parathyroid glands and your chance of having hyperparathyroidism. Suggested next steps are given. Tracking tools will show your calcium and vitamin D levels over time, and will show if your bones are losing density (worsening osteoporosis), or gaining bone density. There are important learning tools on every page, and an extensive video and reading library at the end. The app will provide guidance about talking to your physician regarding the possible need for surgery and other important steps.\n\nA Risk Assessment Tool shows your relative risk for conditions associated with high blood calcium: Osteoporosis, Heart Disease, Heart Arrhythmias and Palpitations, High Blood Pressure, Kidney Stones and Kidney Failure, GERD, several Cancers, and others. Watch your risk assessment graphs change as you address your calcium problems. \n\nThis app was developed by doctors at the Norman Parathyroid Center, the world’s leading parathyroid and calcium treatment center using over 4,000,000 data points from over 30,000 patients. Let the world’s leading doctors help you understand these problems so you and your doctor can make important, informed decisions. Take control of your own health!"

      "label": "Rated 5 stars by nurses and medics alike! Here's what people are saying:\n\nChelsea says: This app is perfect for anyone in the medical field! I'll definitely be using this during my nursing clinicals! Best $4.99 I've spent in a while!\n\nMinifireguy says: \"Easy app to use when on the medic. Easy to open up and get calcs fast. Great app\n\nOmniMedix was created by a practicing street medic with simple design that allows the user to calculate the proper medication infusion rate within seconds instead of fumbling through endless menus. \n\nAgency protocols are different and medications in EMS come and go. OmniMedix is the only calculator based on infusion rates, not specific medications, which allows it to be used with virtually any medication. This allows it the versatility to be used in all clinical environments: EMS, Emergency Department, ICU, medical offices and even veterinary medicine.  \n\nAlso included are weight and temperature conversions, common pediatric calculations, medication bolus calculations, and the Parkland Burn Formula for fluid resuscitation.\n\nWhile most hospital units have IV pumps that take care of the drip rate, most EMS crews don’t, and are either left to calculate drips by hand or \"titrate to effect\". Even if you have the luxury of an IV pump, can you quickly and accurately calculate the correct drip rate by hand if your pump fails? Your patient’s life may depend on it!  This app is a must have for anyone who administers IV medications, and is designed with those who rarely calculate drip rates in mind.\n\nDirections for use: Select the concentration being utilized (mcg/min, mcg/kg/min, etc) to enter its menu. Enter the patient’s weight, the desired dose, medication concentration, and dripset being used. OmniMedix will display the proper flow rate in drops per minute, drops per second, and our proprietary “seconds per drop”, to simplify slower drip rates. \n\nCheck out our YouTube video (search OmniMedix) for a full demo of the app. \n\n\nContent created by: \nCody Blount, BS, NREMT-P, FP-C \n\nSend feedback to: \ninfo@omnimedicsolutions.com"

      "label": "What is iBP?\n\niBP is a blood pressure tracking and analysis tool. Please note, it is not possible to measure your blood pressure by touching the screen. A separate device is required.\n\nWhat kind of analysis does iBP provide?\n\niBP uses color icons to indicate when your blood pressure values are normal, high, or hypertension. It also provides interactive graphs that allow you to display your values by weeks, months, year and time of day. The graphs display lows, highs, averages, and trend lines using statistical analysis.\n\nWhy iBP vs. other blood pressure apps?\n\niBP is a universal app designed to work on the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad, which means you only pay for the app once and you get all versions! iBP is the only blood pressure app with a built in transfer capability to sync all your iOS devices.\n\nWhat are the key features?\n\n* Reads and writes Apple Health blood pressure, pulse, and weight data (details below)\n* Easy data input using dials instead of keyboard\n* Transfer capability to sync all of your iOS devices\n* Calculates Mean Arterial Pressure and Pulse Pressure\n* Track one personal item (blood glucose, stress level, medication dosage, exercise time)\n* Backup / Restore capability\n* Multiple users\n* Multiple email addresses (you and doctor)\n* Multiple email formats (PDF, HTML, CSV, Plain Text)\n* Passcode to protect your data\n* Touch Id for passcode on devices that support it\n* Snapshot of the graphs can be saved\n* User configurable color ranges\n* Weight units (lb or kg)\n* Withings Blood Pressure Monitor & Wireless Scale\n\nApple Health\niBP is now able to read and write Apple Health blood pressure, pulse, and weight data. If your blood pressure monitor (i.e., Omron, iHealth, Withings) adds data to Apple Health then you can easily import that data into this app. If you manually input your data into this app, then it will write that data to Apple Health.\n\nWithings + iBP = No more data entry!\niBP can retrieve your blood pressure and weight data directly from your Withings account.  The Blood Pressure Monitor and wireless Body Scale automatically record and send the data to your account.  There is no data entry required and you can view the data anywhere using a web browser or a variety of mobile apps.\n\n\nDisclaimer: iBP is intended to be used as a means to collect data to be shared with your doctor.

They may be unsafe when they forget to use a walker or apply the wheelchair breaks before standing. All of these facts and procedures can be engrained into memory using a repetitive and effective memory training procedure.\n\nThis Spaced Retrieval Therapy app uses the scientifically-proven method of spaced retrieval training to help people with dementia or other memory impairments to recall important information. Recalling an answer over multiplying intervals of time, such as 1 minute, 2 minutes, 8 minutes, and so on, helps to cement the information in memory.\n\nSpaced Retrieval Therapy is an enhanced interval timer with independent data tracking and prompts. It automatically increases the time between prompts with correct responses and decreases it with incorrect ones. This app will help clinicians, family members, and students keep track of the intervals and performance as they practice up to 3 memory targets.\n\n*Put away your stopwatch and paper - this app is all you need!\n\n*Keeps track of expanding intervals and data so you don't have to\n\n*Works in the background while doing other therapy exercises or using other apps\n\n*Subtle sound and visual prompts let you know it’s time to ask again\n\n*Tracks accuracy and data automatically, & emails you the finished report\n\n\n\"5 Stars - This app is a fantastic inclusion into my therapy toolbox. It is very useful in therapy and helps me keep track patient progress more efficiently.\" - App Store Review\n\n\nSpeech-Language Pathologists, Occupational Therapists, Neuropsychologists, Teachers, Social Workers, and families can all use this simple technique & app to help clients and loved ones remember important information (names, safety procedures, orientation information, etc).\n\nRecommended by top experts in memory training and dementia therapy, Spaced Retrieval Therapy will make your life easier and your therapy more efficient.\n\n\n\"***** Very Useful!  I found this app to be extremely useful during therapy sessions. When juggling multiple activities it can be difficult to remember to cue a patient for each specific interval. This app makes spaced retrieval an easy way to incorporate prospective and short term memory tasks into treatment.\" - SLP on App Store Review\n\n\nVisit our website at http://tactustherapy.com/app/srt/ to link to several articles about this technique and its proven efficacy with dementia, aphasia, normal learners, and more. \n\n\nThis app is also available as part of the Tactus Complete Therapy Toolkit and Tactus Cognitive Therapy Toolkit discount bundles for iPad users.\n\n\nPlease note: This app is a timer and tracks data.  Targets should be individually selected for the memory-impaired person to be relevant and meaningful.  This app is not intended to be used alone by the memory-impaired person, but as a therapy tool by a clinician or family member trained in this technique."

Values are now displayed on the phototherapy nomogram. In addition, it will also tell you the patient's risk zone using the Bhutani Nomogram.\n\nAllows direct age input and includes the option to calculate age from birth and lab sample times. The app has a direct link to source journal articles, nomograms, and a list of the neurotoxicity risk factors. Supports US and SI units (mg/dL and µmol/L).\n\nApp Feature Summary\n-Calculates phototherapy threshold for newborns 35 weeks and older\n-Displays values on phototherapy nomogram\n-Suggests time frame for followup bilirubin levels based on patient risk zone \n-Direct links to reference journal articles\n\n**********************************\nFrequently Asked Questions\n**********************************\n1. I think the graph is backwards. Why is low risk on top and high risk on bottom?\n\nThe graph is directly from the 2004 AAP Hyperbilirubinemia Guidelines. The degree of \"risk\" refers to the infant's risk for developing neurotoxicity. This is different than the Bhutani Nomogram in which \"risk\" refers to the risk for development of severe hyperbilirubinemia. The threshold for treatment (when a data point lies above one of the lines on the graph) of the infant is different based on the predisposing factors (divided into the three risk categories). Babies who are \"low neurotoxicity risk,\" can tolerate higher levels of bilirubin than a baby with medium or high risk. Therefore, a high risk baby will be treated at lower bilirubin levels than a low risk baby. The graph is correct in having low risk on top since a higher value is needed to pass the threshold for treatment (phototherapy). Please see the graph here for verification as well: http://bit.ly/AppPWU. Please email if you have further questions.\n\n******************************************\nIntended for use by pediatricians, neonatologists, physicians, medical students, and pediatric nurses who treat newborn infants in the hospital and as outpatients.\n\nBiliCalc should be used only as a reference aid. The information contained in the app should not be used as a substitute for the exercise of professional clinical judgement.

Don’t rely on your memory or scribbling on pieces of paper; organize everything automatically in a timeline that can be shared between parents, caregivers, daycare, nannies, and anyone else who needs it.\n\nBaby Steps makes it fast and easy to log what’s important to you. Our charts and data visualizations give deeper insights into your child’s sleep, feeding, growth, and other patterns of activity, so you can be more confident and informed in the choices you make.\n\nThe app is designed by a working parent with twins, who was frustrated by the difficulty of keeping track of the activity of his newborn children. When coming home after work, or picking up his children from daycare, he wanted to know when his children had last slept and eaten. This meant the app needed to give that information at a glance, and that logging entries had to be fast enough to do on the go. Baby Steps is designed with this viewpoint in mind: to make everything as easy as possible for parents, without sacrificing powerful visualizations and insights.\n\nUse Baby Steps to log:\n\n• Sleep\n• Nursing, bottles (breast milk, formula), solid food\n• Pumping\n• Diapers, potty use\n• Baths\n• Growth (weight, height, head size)\n• Development milestones\n• Health symptoms, temperature\n• Medicines, vaccines\n• Notes (keep track of anything else you want)\n\nVisualizations:\n\n• Daily recap for common entry types\n• Charts for sleep, nursing, bottles, pumping, diapers, and potty use\n• Activity patterns: visualize the times of day when your child sleeps, feeds, and more\n• Growth charts for weight, height, and head size, with percentile curves\n• Timeline of important milestones\n\nKey features:\n\n• Log entries for multiple babies\n• Collaborate between caregivers: all activity is synced across devices, so you’re always up to date\n• Add comments to any entry\n• Customize entry button placement for faster access\n• Filter entries by type\n• Share charts\n• Use your choice of measurement units (imperial, metric)\n• Add your own milestones, health symptoms, medicines, and vaccines, alongside our presets\n• Export data (JSON or CSV file)"

Unlike other apps that present algorithm sheets, this smart utility guides you to the pertinent therapy by asking one to two questions. ACLS Fast gives you all the rhythms and arrhythmias along with the specific treatments. You also have acute coronary and stroke syndrome management. In addition, there is a two minute timer to assist you with time management during a code. Now you don't have to second guess when two minutes pass and it is time to recheck vitals and shock. Every two minutes a loud alarm activates. The timer is resettable. Need to start inotropes, but you can't remember the right ones? This app has it and it is fast! Finally, you can take an interactive exam. There are many multiple-choice questions from which you can choose. Use this to test your knowledge or sharpen your ability to take care of patients. You can use the app in the field and hospital for rapid diagnosis and treatment. You can also use it as a quick, comprehensive study tool. Either way, nothing is this fast or simple. Also, check out PALS Fast for pediatrics."

Specifically, this App allows the user to document, store, recall, or change the equipment needs, set-up, and procedure needs for physicians involved in challenging patient care procedures.\n\nThe Preference Card® app user can: create and recall files, perform in-app editing, date stamp edits, document and photograph equipment needs and procedure notes to a specific physician and/or procedure. The Photos are useful in documenting Mayo or Back Table set-up, patient positioning, or unusual equipment needs. All photos can be custom labeled.\n\nEmails of specific files created through the Preference Card® App can be sent to other Preference Card® App end users. These emails will automatically integrate the files into the App of the recipient. Further, in-app emails and phone calls can be made to Vendor Representatives through the App software.\n\nThe Preference Card® App will prove useful in cross training OR staff, educating Surgical Technology Students, and in orienting new Surgical Technologists or Circulating Nurses. Special Procedure areas also use the Preference Card® app. So, whether procedures occur in the OR, ER, IR, Endoscopy, or Clinic...the Preference Card® app is the information overload solution.\n\nPreference Card® now features a new function to make finding your Preference Card® files easier! App users can now color code their Preference Card® files to allow grouping by specialty. Users can select the color they wish to group surgeons in alphabetic order within a color coded specialty. This inexpensive, in-app purchase is ideal for Surgical Technicians who cover multiple specialties or who cover call and need to be prepared for any type of surgical procedure."

Users rate their competence in a variety of topics and create personalized Study Stacks. Study Stacks allow users to efficiently remediate identified academic deficiencies. Frequent review of essential academic content allows users to successfully convert the information to long-term memory. \n\nPhysical Therapist Content Master includes an assessment mode that consists of 750 multiple-choice questions. Each multiple-choice question has four unique options and an explanation supporting the correct answer. The multiple-choice questions are designed to assess a user’s mastery of the information presented in the content review mode. The number of questions in each category varies from a minimum of 25 to a maximum of 175. Our Content Tag feature allows users to quickly review questions by topic area (i.e., special tests, cranial nerves, pulmonary function tests). \n\nA formal score report describes a physical therapist’s level of mastery cumulatively, by category, and by timeline. Each of the individual reports provides users with valuable performance data to assess their present level of academic mastery. Utilization of the app on a frequent basis considerably strengthens a physical therapist’s knowledge base and provides the necessary foundation to progress to higher level licensing-like questions. \n\nCompany Information\nScorebuilders is a physical therapist owned company whose sole focus is to prepare students for the National Physical Therapy Examinations. We sell more review products and offer more review courses than any other company. Scorebuilders has experienced three decades of continuous growth and is the recognized leader in physical therapy licensing preparation. Scorebuilders offers candidates the knowledge and insight necessary to achieve their goal of becoming a licensed physical therapist on the first attempt.\n\nCopyright © 2019 Scorebuilders\n\nPhysical Therapist Content Master is the exclusive property of Scorebuilders.

      "label": "FlashRX is a flashcard and quiz-based educational tool for healthcare students and professionals to learn the top 250 medications in the outpatient setting (also known as the Top 200 Drugs or Top 300 Drugs).  Instead of complicated, bloated drug cards, FlashRX’s drug database focuses on simple, usable information to develop your core knowledge base.\n\nThe emphasis on concise, practical knowledge will improve learning and comprehension of the top 250 drugs.  This is a learning tool – NOT a drug reference.  This app is not a comprehensive resource for drug information.\n\nThis app is perfect for pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, physician assistants, nurses, nursing students, physicians, medical students, and other healthcare professionals.  The drug database is designed to aid in studying for both students in school and those preparing for standardized exams (eg, NAPLEX, BCPS, PTCB, ExCPT, PANCE/PANRE, NCLEX, USMLE, COMLEX).\n\n== FEATURES ==\n• Beautiful, intuitive flashcard and quiz modes to optimize your learning strategy\n• Flashcards and quiz content are fully customizable – test yourself on brand/generic names, drug classes, indications, adverse effects, and even typical dose ranges\n• Quiz mode includes a selection algorithm to randomly identify intelligent distractor answers to keep you on your toes\n• An adaptive (Leitner) learning mode so that your time is focused on drug cards that you haven’t yet mastered\n\n== DRUG DATABASE ==\n• Includes information on 250 of the most common outpatient medications based on net sales, total prescriptions, and unique or emerging therapeutic classes\n• Audio pronunciations of both the brand and generic names at any time throughout the app\n• Each drug entry includes its brand name, generic name, generic pronunciation, drug class, indications, adverse effects, and typical dosing\n• The drug database is completely customizable – add or remove drugs, change drug entries, and even record your own pronunciation\n• \"Group\" drugs into therapeutic classes or your own custom drug lists.  These groups can be hidden or shown to focus your studying\n\n== ADAPTIVE LEARNING STATISTICS ==\n• Both flashcard and quiz modes utilize an adaptive learning algorithm to keep track of which drug facts you know well, and which need more review\n• Track your learning progress by viewing your statistics at the end of each flashcard or quiz session, or access the dedicated Adaptive Learning Statistics page for your learning overview\n\n== AUTHOR INFORMATION == \nThis app and all of its content was created by Sean P. Kane, PharmD, BCPS – a clinical pharmacist, associate professor, and author of the popular evidence-based website, ClinCalc.com.  The drug list and drug information closely mirrors the popular video-based course series The Top 250 Drugs (https://top250drugs.com)."

      "label": "Squeezy has helped thousands of women regain confidence in their pelvic floor. Pelvic health specialists around the world recommend Squeezy to their patients every day because it works.\n\nAround 30,000 people use Squeezy regularly to help them remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises. So if you are thinking about downloading Squeezy for your pelvic floor, you are not alone. \n\nAll women should be doing these exercises and some will be doing them as part of a physiotherapy programme.\n\nSqueezy is simple to use, informative and designed to help women to remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises (also known as Kegel exercises). \n\nFeatures includes:\n• A pre-set exercise plan that follows public health guidelines\n• A record of the number of exercises you have completed, compared to your target\n• Visual and audio guides for exercises\n• Exercise reminders with customisable settings\n• Educational information about the pelvic floor\n• “Professional mode” – if working with a pelvic health specialist, you can tailor the exercise plan to fit your needs\n• A bladder diary to keep track of your symptoms, if required\n• Simple and clear interface\n\nSqueezy has been clinically reviewed and approved by the NHS for its clinical safety, and is compliant with NHS Information Governance requirements.\n\nSqueezy won several industry awards including ehi Awards 2016, Health Innovation Network 2016, National Continence Care Awards 2015/16 and was a finalist for awards including Advancing Healthcare Awards 2014 and 2017, Abbvie Sustainable Healthcare Awards 2016.\n\nFor more about Squeezy and additional pelvic health information visit squeezyapp.com.\n\n*Apple Watch users*\nDuring your exercises you need to hold your finger on your Apple Watch face to keep it live and running. The play button changes to state ‘Hold’ when running an exercise.\n\nThis keeps your Watch from dozing off while your attention is focused on your pelvic floor. Most Watch screens go to sleep after 7 or 15 seconds (time dependent on your Watch settings). Squeezy has no control over the screen sleep time on the Watch; it has to obey your Watch settings. \n\nWe hope to be able to improve the Watch experience in future. In the meantime, we’re continuing the existing Watch support because many people find it helpful.\n\nIf you have feedback on the Apple Watch, please get in touch with the developers directly on help@squeezyapp.com.\n\n\nThis app has been translated into Saudi Arabian Arabic.\nتمت ترجمه هذا التطبيق الى اللغه العربيه ( المملكه العربيه السعوديه)‏"

The application has a suggested standard solution based on the schemes most used in intensive care services and allows editing and saving your favorite solutions.\n\nThe application also allows the creation of new solutions from the ampoules available in its service, the calculation of the dosage in mL/hour and the possibility of converting the infused speed into an infused concentration and vice versa. In addition, it is possible to view the therapeutic range individually for the patient's weight as guided by some medical bibliographies and the adjustment of this range by the user depending on the objective and clinical judgment. Thus, the application increases patient safety when prescribing these drugs reducing the risk of calculation errors by the professional.\n\nThe application also has messages to warn about photosensitive solutions and medications that must be diluted in a specific medium such as physiological solution or glucose solution, thus preventing changes in their therapeutic properties.\n\n\nThe application is available in english, portuguese and spanish."

It’s all about tackling the mindset shifts you need to establish a healthier relationship with food and your body—a tactic that is often neglected with other weight loss methods.\n\nThis is not a diet. Diets can feel restrictive and don’t address the root issues, which often are the result of unhealthy relationships with food or exercise that were formed long ago. Instead, hypnosis for weight loss is a practice that reprograms the way you think about food so that you naturally develop healthier habits for the long term.\n\nThere is a reason why Rachael's apps have been downloaded millions of times, because they work.\n\nBenefits can include:\n- Faster weight loss\n- Increased body image confidence\n- Healthier habits for natural weight loss\n- Increase energy\n- Deeper relaxation\n- Improved sleep\n- Increased motivation\n- Focus\n \nThis app features: \n\n* Soothing, therapeutic hypnotherapy tracks designed by Rachael Meddows\n* High quality, state of the art recordings\n* Playlist feature you can customize with in-app purchases\n* Optional hypnosis instructions\n* Choose a short, long, or sleep induction\n* Your choice of eight different background sounds"

      "label": "Congratulations on your pregnancy! With this app we would like to give you a helpful tool, which will make food safety and good nutrition as simple as possible for you for the next nine months. What types of fish contain the least amount of mercury? Which types of cheese should you first strike off of your shopping list? And attending your next business lunch; what can you eat without worrying whether you’ll get toxoplasmosis? This app features a traffic light food labelling system of almost 1000 foodstuffs – they are categorized according to the level of danger to the unborn baby. Due to the background information and advice, you will feel more secure in the complex evaluation of the safety of unknown foods.\n\nHow the app works:\nAt first there is a theoretic part, which informs you in a nutshell about the most common foodborne diseases (toxoplasmosis, listeriosis, and salmonella.)\nThe core of the app is the food search. Here you can initially choose between an alphabetic or a filtered search. At first glance you can see whether a foodstuff is classified as green, orange or red.\nGreen-labelled food means that pregnant women can generally consume it safely - even if it is not necessarily healthy. Of course calories and nutritional value are another matter. On the same note, the permitted foods are always allowed in moderation. This applies especially to spices, herbs, and nuts. If you have a varied and balanced diet, you don't have to worry anymore. Orange let's you know that the safe consumption of the foodstuff depends on several factors (time of pregnancy, personal situation, the art of preparation, quantity, ...) But do not worry at first about the quantity of the orange entries, but do note the advice. Just click on the corresponding food label. You should absolutely avoid all red-labelled foodstuffs. They affect the development of your baby and damage it in the long-term.\n\nUsing the filtered search, however, you can adapt the list of the various risks and food categories to your individual situation. You can easily browse all accessible foods. Or you can filter through food categories and find out which cheese from your favourite camemberts you can replace during the pregnancy.\n\nBy clicking the star you can finally add the desired food to your personal shopping list.\nBy the way, with the help of our hints and advice you will also get guidelines for specific food categories and several more ideas for everyday use. That way you can ensure even greater food safety without getting hysterical.\n\nWe wish you a relaxed pregnancy. All the best!\n\nKirstin & Roman"

      "label": "Comprehension Therapy is a professional speech therapy app that targets auditory and reading comprehension of single words in 5 languages. \n\n*****Enlightening! \n***** Superb! \n***** A Wonderful Tool! \n***** Exceptional App! \n\nDesigned to help people with aphasia and cognitive deficits from stroke and other brain injuries, it is also a valuable tool for older children with special needs including autism. 3 user-friendly modes include Listen, Read, and Listen&Read to target individualized goals. The app automatically adjusts difficulty based on performance, allowing for independent practice. Built-in scoring, hints, and a results summary that can be e-mailed to the therapist in report format make therapy easy! Over 500 nouns, 100 verbs, and 100 adjectives are paired with full-color photographs, recorded voice, and clear text for hours of therapy. You can add your own images too! \n\n**Try it for FREE as part of Language Therapy Lite or buy this app in our 4-in-1 Language Therapy*** \n\nFeatures \n\n3 modes: \n- \"Listen\": match an auditory stimulus (spoken word) to a picture \n- \"Read\": match a written stimulus (printed word) to a picture \n- \"Listen & Read\": match an auditory stimulus (spoken word) to a written word \n\nOver 700 clear full-color photographs of functional vocabulary selected by a Speech-Language Pathologist \n\n10 categories of nouns including animals, foods, objects, concepts, places, people, body parts and more; select which categories are targeted \n\nSelect from 2, 3, 4, or 6 photos on the screen or use the \"Auto\" feature to automatically adjust the field size based on performance \n\n3 levels of difficulty adjust the relatedness of foils (semantic and phonemic) to move from Easy to Hard \n\nAphasia-friendly interface avoids use of professional jargon and features clear symbols for independent use by children and adults \n\nChild-friendly mode eliminates references to alcohol and violence as well as disables links to outside sites (iTunes & social media) \n\nReal recorded voice provides 5 choices of languages with neutral accent in slow, natural speech for easy comprehension in English (US/Canada), English (UK), Spanish, German, and French \n\nSmooth and automatic transitions to the next set allow for multiple repetitions in far less time than it takes to select and lay out photo flash cards, while still allowing you to move forward and back to review answers or skip ahead \n\nAutomatic scoring tracks success and progress on-screen \n\nResults can be e-mailed in table and report-ready format so clients can keep their therapist informed of their progress for telepractice and therapists can send results to themselves for charting later, using the copy-and-paste ready format to decrease documentation time \n\nAll Tactus Therapy Solutions Apps participate in the 50% off Volume Purchase Program, so talk to your school about buying in bulk! \n\nThis app collects NO personal information, has NO in-app purchases, and primary links to outside pages can be deactivated."

The smaller iPad versions are manageable though you will probably require two hands to hold it.\n\nToday’s New Idea is a “not for profit” business which means all proceeds from the sale of this app go toward the development of this app and other apps we hope users will find educational or beneficial."

It can also be a stretch of.\r\n\r\n■ 3D number touch\r\nIt is a training to train the ciliary muscles by randomly following images with different sizes, shapes, colors, and numbers. When a person sees things with his eyes, the ciliary muscle, which is the muscle of the eye, adjusts the distance to the object and the angle of refraction of light, and the ciliary muscle is trained by number touch training.\r\n\r\n◎ Visual acuity measurement\r\nThe app also comes with a vision measurement tool. You can continue the above 3D stereoscopic training every day and check your eyesight condition with the eyesight measurement tool on a regular basis.\r\n\r\n◎ Summary\r\nThree 3D stereoscopic trainings to train eye movements, muscle movements, and intracerebral visual acuity.

      "label": "****Thank you for making us a TOP 25 App in US, UK and Canada App Store category specific rankings!****\n\nSeasonal affective disorder, or SAD, is a kind of depression that appears at certain times of the year. Light therapy is one of the potential treatments for this condition. Almost 80% of the people who try light therapy find it beneficial. This app converts your apple device into a light box.\n\nWhy you SHOULD NOT download this App:\n1. If you are looking for a SAD Light Box App that generates an intensity of 10,000 Lux\n2. If you are looking for a quick fix and can not commit to consistent morning exposure sessions for at least 2 weeks\n3. If you will get turned off by the simplicity of this app and the solution to Seasonal Affective Disorder\n\nWhy you SHOULD download this App:\n1. If you want to try a cheap yet effective alternative to a traditional Light box which uses lower intensity BLUE LIGHT (approx. 100 to 575 Lux) and is backed by research (Google research paper: The effects of low-intensity narrow-band blue-light treatment compared to bright white-light treatment in sub-syndromal seasonal affective disorder by NCBI, US National Library of Medicine)\n2. If you would rather be intelligent and try something for a fiver rather than spend a few hundred dollars on a conventional light box\n3. If you are able to consistently commit to regular morning exposure sessions for at least 2 weeks \n4. If you would be happy with a REALLY SIMPLE APP that transforms your Apple device into a Light box and is more portable and user friendly\n5. If the weather is making you sad :( and you would rather be happy :)\n     \nThis app can also help you:\n1. Determine if you are suffering from Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD)/ Cabin Fever/ Winter Blues/ Seasonal Depression with help of a short scored test\n2. Create your own unique shade of Blue / White / any other color light that works best for you\n3. Use the app as a Dawn Simulator (set alarm)\n4. Set timer for your light box to time your morning exposure sessions\n5. Shop for other products to help with SAD\n6. Listen to the Radio in the background\n\nUV Rating: The UV emission from your Apple Device is 0, hence this app does not have a UV rating. \n\nSome other activities you might want to try to deal with symptoms of Seasonal Affective Disorder are:\n• End your morning shower with a cold shower\n• Try to arrange the spaces you spend time in to maximize sunlight exposure\n• Keep curtains open during the day\n• Trim tree branches or hedges that may be blocking some of the light from getting into your home\n• Move furniture so that you sit near a window or, if you exercise indoors, set up your exercise equipment by a window\n• Install skylights and add lamps\n• Build physical activity into your lifestyle preferably before SAD symptoms take hold. Physical activity relieves stress, builds energy and increases both your physical and mental well-being and resilience\n• Make a habit of taking a daily noon-hour walk, particularly if you commute to school or work in the dark hours of the day\n• Meditate at least 20 min a day (focus on your breathing)\n• Try High intensity training if you are fit enough and have less time\n• Maintain good sleep hygiene\n• When all else fails, try a winter vacation in sunny climates—if the pocket and work schedule allow. Keep in mind that the symptoms will recur after you return home\n\nREFUND POLICY: If you consistently use the App for 14 days and show us that you genuinely tried but did not get any results, WE WILL REFUND 100% OF YOUR MONEY. *Subject to terms and conditions of Apple Inc. and the Apple App Store.\n\nSmile, because somewhere far away, we are cheering for you :)\n\n*THIS APP MUST NOT BE USED TO SUBSTITUTE ANY MEDICATION/ MEDICAL DEVICE. THE CREATORS/ PUBLISHERS OF THIS APP WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGE RESULTING AS A USE OF THIS APP. PLEASE CONSULT YOUR DOCTOR BEFORE MAKING ANY CHANGES. NO PART OF THIS DESCRIPTION OR APP MUST BE CONSIDERED AS MEDICAL ADVICE*"

      "label": "Pedi STAT EMS was developed specifically for prehospital providers.  We’ve taken all the content from our original Pedi STAT application and carefully selected components that are unique to providers in EMS.  We’ve solicited feedback from leaders in out of hospital care, including paramedics, EMTs, air medical flight crews, and medical directors. We’ve condensed the content to be applicable to those providing care outside the hospital, including first responders, firefighters, EMTs, Paramedics, and Critical Care Transport providers.\n\nMedication dosing and pediatric equipment sizes are easily and rapidly accessed, and accurately calculated based on provider input of either weight, length, age, or Broselow / Pediatape weight estimates.  We are attempting to eliminate medical errors by calculating not only the correct pediatric medication dose, but also the volume to be administered for patient specific conditions.  We have also included algorithms and medical calculators to assist providers in multiple areas, including managing pediatric cardiac arrest, burn size estimation and fluid resuscitation, and Glasgow Coma Scale.\n\nCaring for pediatric patients is associated with a large number of challenges, the most important being selecting the correct equipment and medications, and then dosing the medications correctly.  Our goal is to eliminate these challenges as much as possible, and allow the provider to concentrate on what is most important, the patient.\n\nSuggestions for improvements or additions are always welcome:  Pedi-STAT.com"

      "label": "Do you have tinnitus or “ringing in the ears”? Tinnitus HQ helps you understand and relieve your tinnitus symptoms.\n\nRecent research shows that tinnitus can be treated by listening to sounds that have been filtered to remove your specific tinnitus frequencies.*\n\nWith Tinnitus HQ, you can apply advanced filters to over 500 high-quality sounds to find relief for your symptoms.\n\nSimply apply a bandpass filter to any sound or mix to isolate frequencies in a narrow range. Move this filter up and down the frequency range until it closely matches the ringing frequency in your ears. \n\nAdd a bandstop filter at these frequencies to any sound or mix to create your tinnitus mask.\n\nThe advanced filters can be applied to both ears or just one ear, and different frequency ranges can be used for each ear.\n\nYou can set a wide range of filter widths from 0.1 to 4.0 octaves, down to 1Hz resolution.\n\nAnd you can adjust the volume level in each ear with a single balance control.\n\nWith Tinnitus HQ you can create advanced natural-sounding tinnitus masks to help relieve your tinnitus symptoms. \n\nTinnitus HQ features:\n\n• Over 500 high-quality natural sound recordings\n• Precision bandpass and bandstop filters to identify and mask ringing frequencies\n• Wide frequency range: 128 Hz to 16 kHz\n• Filter widths from 0.1 to 4.0 Octaves, settable to 1Hz resolution\n• Two-ear and single-ear filtering capability\n• Independent Left-Right ear filter frequencies and widths\n• Left-Right ear volume balance control\n• Easy-to-create blended mixes of any 4 sounds\n• Runs in background while using other apps or when the screen is locked\n• Timer with slow audio fade-out\n• Beautiful high-definition images from around the globe\n• Modern easy-to-use interface\n• 15 different natural sound categories, including Rain, Rivers & Streams, Ocean, Lakes, Wind, Water Fountains, Fire, Birds, Crickets & Insects, Cars, Trains, Public Places, Household, Industrial, Soundscapes.\n\nDownload Tinnitus HQ now.\n\n\n* See http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0138595, http://www.pnas.org/content/107/3/1207.full, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2918775/ for descriptions of notched sound therapy and its positive results.\n\n* Please talk with your doctor about ringing in the ears and any other symptoms.

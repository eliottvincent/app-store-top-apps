      "label": "Pregnant? This is for YOU!\nOur leading app allows you to use just your iPhone microphone to record and share your baby’s sounds. It is the best-in-class, has excellent reviews, is super simple and safe to use. Now supports Apple Airpods and Bluetooth Headphones.\n\n\"It took some time and patience... thank you for creating this cheap, awesome technology to use at home.\" - Niki\n\nCategory #1 in the USA and 102 other countries. Here's why...\n\nDeveloped by parents like you (with expertise in sound engineering and app development) who wanted a trustworthy, safe and easy-to-use way to record our baby's fetal sounds (kicks, heartbeat etc.) - and keep a record of a quality that we hadn't been able to find before in other apps. It has been extensively tested on expectant mothers.\n\n\"I was skeptical at first. Great app! Worth it.\" - Legretta \n\n**** But honestly, does it actually work?? ****\nYes. We've sound-engineered ways to attempt to isolate the baby's heart beat, sounds (kicks, heart beat and more) and using an advanced algorithm, amplify them making them easier to detect and hear.\n\nNOTE: It takes time, technique and patience and depends on the position and number of weeks of your baby so you'll need to stick with it. When you do, our results are excellent. Results are best between 27-40 weeks as your baby is bigger and stronger. \n\nWe constantly improve our extensive tutorial and techniques to handhold you through - we even have a support group on Facebook so you can get help.\n\nWe want you to be happy with Hear My Baby heartbeat and getting results can sometimes be difficult.  If you are struggling (can't find your own heartbeat etc. DO contact us via support. We want to help you!\n\nGIFT THIS APP: Click the “Buy App” arrow on the iTunes® App Store\n\n\nFAQs\n\n**** No Accessories Required ****\nWe use the internal microphone from your phone to attempt to listen and record your fetal sound. We recommend Bluetooth Headphones for best results.\n\n**** How It Works ****\n1. Hear My Baby, has been precisely engineered to listen to abdominal sounds, then record and amplify them. Listen to your own heartbeat first to confirm the app is set up correctly. \n2. It works best when baby is head down and their back is facing forwards.\n3. Remove the case, be in a very quiet room and focus on your lower abdomen. Listen then Tap record.\n4. Our simple recording management helps you to keep a record of your special moment\n5. Take a selfie if you wish and share \n6. We'll walk you through exactly how to get the best baby heartbeat results.\n\n**** Easy Share Feature ****\nSharing is awesome you can opt to share via Facebook, Whats App, Instagram or email.\n\n**** We Care About Your Privacy ****\nWe take your privacy and special moment seriously. You decide who sees or hears it and can delete it at any time.\n\n**** Before you start... ****\nYou DO need to carefully follow the instructions for Hear My Baby to work. A quiet room is critical for results as the mic is super sensitive.   HMB doesn't fake the baby heartbeat or other fetal sounds :) \n\nPlease Note: results are normally superb, however the recording may not work if your placenta is at the front of the tummy or the baby is in the wrong position.\n\n**** Supported Phones ****\n13,12, X, Xs, 11, 11 Pro, 8, 7, 7+, SE, 6s, 6s+, 6, 6+ 5c, 5s & 5. We don't support iPad.\n\n**** Worried about safety? We are too! ***\nHMB is safe but to be extra sure DO switch your iPhone to airplane mode. This is a precaution and automatically stops all cellular transmissions.\n\n**** Is it a substitute for medical devices/support? ****\nNo - under no circumstances is HMB a substitute for medical support - if you don't get a result it doesn't mean anything is wrong :) Consult your doctor for any advice. We are NOT approved by the FDA. This is not a medical device and is not a medical baby heartbeat monitor. It is for FUN.\n\nPlease do check our T&Cs before downloading.\n\nFor results examples: www.facebook.com/hearmybaby\nwww.instagram.com/hearmybabyapp"

The guidelines articles, as published in the Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease, as well as the comprehensive risk estimates, can be accessed through https://www.asccp.org/guidelines.  \n\nThese evidence-based management guidelines, initially developed in 2019, came together through a consensus process of 19 organizations. The updated management guidelines aim to:\n • Allow for a more complete and precise estimation of risk\n • Provide more appropriate intervention for high-risk individuals (detect and treat more precancer)\n • Recommend less intervention for low-risk individuals (decrease testing and treatment that won’t prevent cancer and may cause reproductive harm)\n • Allow for the future addition of new risk modifiers and screening and management technologies\n\nSee https://www.asccp.org/UserGuide for tips on using the app."

      "label": "Meet Freya, your virtual birth partner from The Positive Birth Company! Freya will coach you through every single surge with a simple breathing technique and visualisation. She will help you relax between surges with a mix of guided relaxations, positive affirmations, gentle music and calming visualisations. Freya makes it easy for you to keep track of your surges and you can visit the log at any point to see how frequently your surges are coming and how long they are lasting. Freya will also let you know when your labour is established and when it might be a good time to contact your midwife. You will never birth alone with Freya by your side.\n \nTRACK YOUR SURGES\n\nIn hypnobirthing we refer to contractions as surges, as a ‘surge’ more accurately describes the sensation you’ll experience when in labour. Freya is the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the app store, designed specifically with hypnobirthing mums in mind, but can be used by anyone.\n \nPREPARE FOR BIRTH\n\nYou can also use Freya in pregnancy to help you relax and prepare for your birth. In fact the more you listen to the guided relaxations and positive affirmations, the more familiar they will become and the more effective they will be at helping you relax when it comes to birth. Positive affirmations have been proven to change the way your mind works and listening regularly will help you feel less anxious and more confident in the lead up to birth. \n \nTHE SCIENCE\n\nWe know the more relaxed you are during birth, the more oxytocin you will produce. Oxytocin helps your uterus to work efficiently, making labour faster and more comfortable. \n \nLIFESKILLS\n\nYou can also use Freya post-birth any time you feel you could benefit from taking some deep breaths or need some help finding your zen. Everything you learn through using Freya - mindfulness exercises, breathing techniques, the benefits of taking time out - are skills for life.\n\nIf you have any questions or spot any pesky bugs lurking about the place (!) please do let us know at help@thepositivebirthcompany.co.uk\n\nWHAT YOU’LL GET:\n\niPhone and Apple Watch app\nA timer to record your surges (also known as a contraction timer)\nCoaching audio to keep your mind focused on breathing through each surge\nA gentle expanding visualisation which you can use to sync your breathing\nA detailed log of your surges over time, so you can track your progress through labour\nAbility to easily share the log with your birth partner, midwife or doula\nGuided relaxations, positive affirmations and soothing visuals to help keep you calm and relaxed, making birth easier, quicker and more straightforward (can also be used in pregnancy and postnatally)\nCoaching created by renowned hypnobirthing expert Siobhan Miller, founder of The Positive Birth Company\n\nDownload the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the App Store and prepare to meet your baby in the best possible way, feeling calm and confident, relaxed and happy!"

Using this app is the equivalent to spending hours with the world’s most experienced doctors teaching you about your calcium, parathyroid, osteoporosis, and vitamin D issues. Your tests results are analyzed to determine if a problem exists, what risks are associated, and what to do about it. Beautiful graphs make understanding these problems simple!\n\nBlood tests and bone density scans can be difficult to interpret—even many doctors do not diagnose calcium, vitamin D, and parathyroid problems correctly or timely. Hyperparathyroidism is a disease that affects 1 in 800 people and 1 in 250 women over 50 and is very often overlooked while patients suffer from chronic fatigue, memory loss, depression, osteoporosis, bone pain and many other symptoms. Calcium Pro is a powerful software program that will analyze your calcium health and provide you guidance about the status of your bones, kidneys, parathyroid glands, vitamin D, and other related health issues.\n\nYou start by entering your test results for calcium, parathyroid hormone, and vitamin D. Then we look at your bone density (osteoporosis levels). CalciumPro will analyze and graph your tests making them easy to understand. It will let you know the status of your parathyroid glands and your chance of having hyperparathyroidism. Suggested next steps are given. Tracking tools will show your calcium and vitamin D levels over time, and will show if your bones are losing density (worsening osteoporosis), or gaining bone density. There are important learning tools on every page, and an extensive video and reading library at the end. The app will provide guidance about talking to your physician regarding the possible need for surgery and other important steps.\n\nA Risk Assessment Tool shows your relative risk for conditions associated with high blood calcium: Osteoporosis, Heart Disease, Heart Arrhythmias and Palpitations, High Blood Pressure, Kidney Stones and Kidney Failure, GERD, several Cancers, and others. Watch your risk assessment graphs change as you address your calcium problems. \n\nThis app was developed by doctors at the Norman Parathyroid Center, the world’s leading parathyroid and calcium treatment center using over 4,000,000 data points from over 30,000 patients. Let the world’s leading doctors help you understand these problems so you and your doctor can make important, informed decisions. Take control of your own health!"

It will help you receive more money every month from the VA for your injuries and help you document your injuries and treatment.\n\nThis app is not just a calculator, it will tell you what information you need to provide (based on your selected injuries/diagnoses) and allow you to document and save the information in order to receive the most compensation for your injuries and illnesses.  It allows you to document your injuries, symptoms, doctor visits, episodes and medications.  It helps you save and organize the information in a secure encrypted database. When you are ready for your VA interview, email all of your injuries with your documentation to yourself or the VA.  If you don't provide documentation to the VA, you may not receive the full compensation for your injuries or illnesses.  It works completely offline, without an internet connection.\n\nThe VA will rely on YOU to provide them with all of the medical information that is pertinent to the injury you are claiming.  They cannot not look through your medical records for you.\n\n** Active duty personnel - Download it before you deploy!\n\n**  Use it to track injuries, and care given for you or your battle buddy.  Everything in the app is self contained so it works when you are not connected to the internet.\n\n** Veterans - My VA Benefits tells you how get a copy of your medical records from the Department of Defense (DoD) and the VA.  It also helps you request your medical records using the Freedom Of Information Act (FOIA).\n\n** If you cannot find your diagnosis, let us know and we will research if for you.  Just submit your question to our forum at our website: http://myvabenefits.us/\n\n**Submit questions to our forum: http://myvabenefits.us/index.php/forum/index \n\n** We provide free updates for the app with the latest codes and rate tables when the VA releases them.\n\n** If you encounter an issue with the app, do not uninstall it or you may lose your data.  Just contact us at http://myvabenefits.us and we will fix it.\n\n** For Back injuries see code 5320 or search for \"spine\".\n\n** For Hearing loss, you cannot self-diagnose because \"An examination for hearing impairment for VA purposes must be conducted by a state-licensed audiologist and must include a controlled speech discrimination test (Maryland CNC) and a puretone audiometry test.

The app is highly customizable and useful in all medical specialties.\n\nEntries are securely kept in your iOS device and are not sent to any outside server, website or database. Reports are created and saved as a password protected PDF file (encrypted using AES-128) and a CSV (comma-separated values) file that is compressed to a ZIP file (which allows password protection and is encrypted using AES-256) to comply with HIPAA security requirements. The reports can then be emailed, accessed via iTunes and the Files app, sent using AirDrop, or copied to your iCloud Drive or DropBox. CSV files can be imported into a spreadsheet program.\n\nOne should not rely on this app alone to keep track of their procedures and is advised to frequently backup the files created. Information on backing up and restoring your data is included in the app's Help/Instructions view.\n\nFEATURES\n• Keep a log of the procedures you have performed, assisted in, were 2nd assist in, observed, supervised, and/or interpreted for documentation purposes.\n• Document the patient's name, ID number, age, date performed, location, supervisor, diagnosis, complications and additional notes with the procedures performed. Also, one can take a photo with your device's camera or import a photo from your photos library from within the app, and include the photo in a record.\n• Option to select one or multiple diagnoses from a list of either custom diagnoses or ICD-10 diagnoses for any given procedure.\n• Select multiple procedures performed on a single patient.\n• Sort by date (ascending or descending), patient name, procedure name, and medical specialty.\n• Capture supervisor's signature to attest that you performed or assisted in the pro­cedure(s) and include the signature ima­ges in your reports. Either obtain the supervisor's signature attestation at the time you create the log entry, or save the entry without the signature and obtain the signature attestation at a later time.\n• Detailed help/instructions section.\n\nCUSTOMIZABLE\n• List of procedures, favorite diagnoses, and complications are easily customizable (you can add procedures/diagnoses/complications to or delete them from the lists). (ICD-10 diagnoses cannot be edited or deleted.)\n• Locations and Supervisor's names are saved and can be selected from a picker so you don't have to type them in again when adding another log entry.\n• Add up to four custom fields in addition to the default fields listed above in Features.\n\nREPORTS\n• Create reports in password protected PDF format and as a CSV file that is password protected in a ZIP format, as well as a password protected backup of your data, that can then be emailed, sent via AirDrop, sent to your iCloud Drive or Dropbox account, or downloaded using iTunes when your iOS device is con­nected to your computer.\n• Reports can be created for a specific date range, and one can specify the primary, secondary and tertiary sort order of the PDF report.\n\nBACKUP\n• In addition to backing up to iCloud and/or iTunes, if you have a DropBox account, you can copy the password protected backup file and reports to DropBox from within the Procedure Log app. \n• You can also use the Files app to transfer files to your iCloud Drive, Dropbox account, or, if you have a Mac computer, use AirDrop to transfer it to your Mac computer.\n• You can also email the password protected backup file to yourself.\n\nSECURITY\n• App is password protected and all data is encrypted when you log off the app or the app is no longer the active app.\n• PDF and CSV reports are encrypted and password protected.\n• Retrieve your username and password if you have forgotten them; you must first answer several security questions in the \"Create User\" or the \"Edit User\" views."

      "label": "What is iBP?\n\niBP is a blood pressure tracking and analysis tool. Please note, it is not possible to measure your blood pressure by touching the screen. A separate device is required.\n\nWhat kind of analysis does iBP provide?\n\niBP uses color icons to indicate when your blood pressure values are normal, high, or hypertension. It also provides interactive graphs that allow you to display your values by weeks, months, year and time of day. The graphs display lows, highs, averages, and trend lines using statistical analysis.\n\nWhy iBP vs. other blood pressure apps?\n\niBP is a universal app designed to work on the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad, which means you only pay for the app once and you get all versions! iBP is the only blood pressure app with a built in transfer capability to sync all your iOS devices.\n\nWhat are the key features?\n\n* Reads and writes Apple Health blood pressure, pulse, and weight data (details below)\n* Easy data input using dials instead of keyboard\n* Transfer capability to sync all of your iOS devices\n* Calculates Mean Arterial Pressure and Pulse Pressure\n* Track one personal item (blood glucose, stress level, medication dosage, exercise time)\n* Backup / Restore capability\n* Multiple users\n* Multiple email addresses (you and doctor)\n* Multiple email formats (PDF, HTML, CSV, Plain Text)\n* Passcode to protect your data\n* Touch Id for passcode on devices that support it\n* Snapshot of the graphs can be saved\n* User configurable color ranges\n* Weight units (lb or kg)\n* Withings Blood Pressure Monitor & Wireless Scale\n\nApple Health\niBP is now able to read and write Apple Health blood pressure, pulse, and weight data. If your blood pressure monitor (i.e., Omron, iHealth, Withings) adds data to Apple Health then you can easily import that data into this app. If you manually input your data into this app, then it will write that data to Apple Health.\n\nWithings + iBP = No more data entry!\niBP can retrieve your blood pressure and weight data directly from your Withings account.  The Blood Pressure Monitor and wireless Body Scale automatically record and send the data to your account.  There is no data entry required and you can view the data anywhere using a web browser or a variety of mobile apps.\n\n\nDisclaimer: iBP is intended to be used as a means to collect data to be shared with your doctor.

Errors in the administration of medications are commonplace and can result in significant harm to patients. The 2009 NPSA report ‘Safety in Doses’ identified 72,482 medication incident reports in one year. Of these 100 had resulted in death or severe harm. In addition, such errors can have a significant effect on the person administering the medication\n\nIn acute care settings there can be many distractions, making it difficult to concentrate on the often complex calculations required when administering medicines.

Select the correct spelling, then copy the answer.\n\n\n3) Type: Practice typing common sentences from 1-8 words in length.

See your errors highlighted.\n\n\n4) Write: Generate a sentence or paragraph to a writing prompt in functional categories such as taking notes, writing personal information, and making lists. \n**Built-in Support: The Hint button gives you a word bank. Select words from the word bank to add to your entry.\n\n\nThe settings allow you to adjust the difficulty, cues available, and letter case for Match.

Physical Therapist Assistant Content Master is designed to assist physical therapist assistants to possess full command of core academic content. Physical Therapist Assistant Content Master is an ideal tool for physical therapist assistant students, recent physical therapist assistant graduates, and licensed physical therapist assistants.\n\nThe academic content is organized into unique system and non-system categories. \n\nMusculoskeletal System\nNeuromuscular System\nCardiopulmonary System\nOther Systems\nEquipment and Devices\nTherapeutic Modalities\nSafety and Protection\nProfessional Responsibilities\nResearch\n\nPhysical therapist assistants can review selected content by scrolling through subcategories in each of the system and non-system areas. Our innovative design presents academic content in a user-friendly format that allows users to easily digest essential information. Users rate their competence in a variety of topics and create personalized Study Stacks. Study Stacks allow users to efficiently remediate identified academic deficiencies. Frequent review of essential academic content allows users to successfully convert the information to long-term memory. \n\nPhysical Therapist Assistant Content Master includes an assessment mode that consists of 600 multiple-choice questions. Each multiple-choice question has four unique options and an explanation supporting the correct answer. The multiple-choice questions are designed to assess a user’s mastery of the information presented in the content review mode. The number of questions in each category varies from a minimum of 25 to a maximum of 125. Our Content Tag feature allows users to quickly review questions by topic area (i.e., special tests, cranial nerves, pulmonary function tests). \n\nA formal score report describes a physical therapist assistant’s level of mastery cumulatively, by category, and by timeline. Each of the individual reports provides users with valuable performance data to assess their present level of academic mastery. Utilization of the app on a frequent basis considerably strengthens a physical therapist assistant’s knowledge base and provides the necessary foundation to progress to higher level licensing-like questions. \n\nCompany Information\nScorebuilders is a physical therapist owned company whose sole focus is to prepare students for the National Physical Therapy Examinations. We sell more review products and offer more review courses than any other company. Scorebuilders has experienced three decades of continuous growth and is the recognized leader in physical therapy licensing preparation. Scorebuilders offers candidates the knowledge and insight necessary to achieve their goal of becoming a licensed physical therapist assistant on the first attempt.\n\nCopyright © 2019 Scorebuilders\n\nPhysical Therapist Assistant Content Master is the exclusive property of Scorebuilders.

      "label": "\"Love This App!\" \"Very Useful!\" \"Perfect!\" \"So Easy to Use!\" \"Great for my patients!\"\nSee why thousands of users around the world are raving about this app!\n\nPeople with memory impairments can become worried when they don't remember where they are or other important information. They may be unsafe when they forget to use a walker or apply the wheelchair breaks before standing. All of these facts and procedures can be engrained into memory using a repetitive and effective memory training procedure.\n\nThis Spaced Retrieval Therapy app uses the scientifically-proven method of spaced retrieval training to help people with dementia or other memory impairments to recall important information. Recalling an answer over multiplying intervals of time, such as 1 minute, 2 minutes, 8 minutes, and so on, helps to cement the information in memory.\n\nSpaced Retrieval Therapy is an enhanced interval timer with independent data tracking and prompts. It automatically increases the time between prompts with correct responses and decreases it with incorrect ones. This app will help clinicians, family members, and students keep track of the intervals and performance as they practice up to 3 memory targets.\n\n*Put away your stopwatch and paper - this app is all you need!\n\n*Keeps track of expanding intervals and data so you don't have to\n\n*Works in the background while doing other therapy exercises or using other apps\n\n*Subtle sound and visual prompts let you know it’s time to ask again\n\n*Tracks accuracy and data automatically, & emails you the finished report\n\n\n\"5 Stars - This app is a fantastic inclusion into my therapy toolbox. It is very useful in therapy and helps me keep track patient progress more efficiently.\" - App Store Review\n\n\nSpeech-Language Pathologists, Occupational Therapists, Neuropsychologists, Teachers, Social Workers, and families can all use this simple technique & app to help clients and loved ones remember important information (names, safety procedures, orientation information, etc).\n\nRecommended by top experts in memory training and dementia therapy, Spaced Retrieval Therapy will make your life easier and your therapy more efficient.\n\n\n\"***** Very Useful!  I found this app to be extremely useful during therapy sessions. When juggling multiple activities it can be difficult to remember to cue a patient for each specific interval. This app makes spaced retrieval an easy way to incorporate prospective and short term memory tasks into treatment.\" - SLP on App Store Review\n\n\nVisit our website at http://tactustherapy.com/app/srt/ to link to several articles about this technique and its proven efficacy with dementia, aphasia, normal learners, and more. \n\n\nThis app is also available as part of the Tactus Complete Therapy Toolkit and Tactus Cognitive Therapy Toolkit discount bundles for iPad users.\n\n\nPlease note: This app is a timer and tracks data.  Targets should be individually selected for the memory-impaired person to be relevant and meaningful.  This app is not intended to be used alone by the memory-impaired person, but as a therapy tool by a clinician or family member trained in this technique."

Covering over 80 muscles with more than 150 trigger points.\n\nMyofascial trigger points are one of the most common sources of pain, and are often overlooked by health professionals. \n\nThis app strives to help you find the source of pain via intuitive interface: tap the body where your pain is and see which trigger points refer pain to that area. Over 50 distinct pain areas are covered.\n\nYou can also find trigger points by by tapping a muscle on the muscle model, by choosing a muscle from the alphabetized list, or by using the search bar. If you don't know exactly what you're looking for, you can search using keywords such as \"elbow\", which will show the muscles of the elbow as well as any pain areas or conditions related to the elbow (e.g. \"lateral elbow pain\", \"tennis elbow\").\n\nTrigger points can cause or mimic a variety of conditions such as \"Tendinitis\" and \"Tennis Elbow\". More than 40 conditions are covered. Choose a condition and see a list of muscles whose trigger points can cause or mimic that condition.\n\nIn each trigger point illustration, an \"x\" marks the location of the point, while the area of referred pain is colored in blue.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: this app does not include treatment information; its aim is to help find the source of specific pain. Once you've identified a trigger point please consult a massage therapist or otherwise trained professional. There are also myriad self-treatment resources available both in book and video format should you choose to treat yourself.\n\n4520c652df"

      "label": "Make reviewing essential physical therapy academic content enjoyable! Physical Therapist Content Master is designed to assist physical therapists to possess full command of core academic content. Physical Therapist Content Master is an ideal tool for physical therapist students, recent physical therapy graduates, and licensed physical therapists.\n\nThe academic content is organized into unique system and non-system categories. \n\nMusculoskeletal System\nNeuromuscular System\nCardiopulmonary System\nOther Systems\nEquipment and Devices\nTherapeutic Modalities\nSafety and Protection\nProfessional Responsibilities\nResearch\n\nPhysical therapists can review selected content by scrolling through subcategories in each of the system and non-system areas. Our innovative design presents academic content in a user-friendly format that allows users to easily digest essential information. Users rate their competence in a variety of topics and create personalized Study Stacks. Study Stacks allow users to efficiently remediate identified academic deficiencies. Frequent review of essential academic content allows users to successfully convert the information to long-term memory. \n\nPhysical Therapist Content Master includes an assessment mode that consists of 750 multiple-choice questions. Each multiple-choice question has four unique options and an explanation supporting the correct answer. The multiple-choice questions are designed to assess a user’s mastery of the information presented in the content review mode. The number of questions in each category varies from a minimum of 25 to a maximum of 175. Our Content Tag feature allows users to quickly review questions by topic area (i.e., special tests, cranial nerves, pulmonary function tests). \n\nA formal score report describes a physical therapist’s level of mastery cumulatively, by category, and by timeline. Each of the individual reports provides users with valuable performance data to assess their present level of academic mastery. Utilization of the app on a frequent basis considerably strengthens a physical therapist’s knowledge base and provides the necessary foundation to progress to higher level licensing-like questions. \n\nCompany Information\nScorebuilders is a physical therapist owned company whose sole focus is to prepare students for the National Physical Therapy Examinations. We sell more review products and offer more review courses than any other company. Scorebuilders has experienced three decades of continuous growth and is the recognized leader in physical therapy licensing preparation. Scorebuilders offers candidates the knowledge and insight necessary to achieve their goal of becoming a licensed physical therapist on the first attempt.\n\nCopyright © 2019 Scorebuilders\n\nPhysical Therapist Content Master is the exclusive property of Scorebuilders.

      "label": "Squeezy has helped thousands of women regain confidence in their pelvic floor. Pelvic health specialists around the world recommend Squeezy to their patients every day because it works.\n\nAround 30,000 people use Squeezy regularly to help them remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises. So if you are thinking about downloading Squeezy for your pelvic floor, you are not alone. \n\nAll women should be doing these exercises and some will be doing them as part of a physiotherapy programme.\n\nSqueezy is simple to use, informative and designed to help women to remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises (also known as Kegel exercises). \n\nFeatures includes:\n• A pre-set exercise plan that follows public health guidelines\n• A record of the number of exercises you have completed, compared to your target\n• Visual and audio guides for exercises\n• Exercise reminders with customisable settings\n• Educational information about the pelvic floor\n• “Professional mode” – if working with a pelvic health specialist, you can tailor the exercise plan to fit your needs\n• A bladder diary to keep track of your symptoms, if required\n• Simple and clear interface\n\nSqueezy has been clinically reviewed and approved by the NHS for its clinical safety, and is compliant with NHS Information Governance requirements.\n\nSqueezy won several industry awards including ehi Awards 2016, Health Innovation Network 2016, National Continence Care Awards 2015/16 and was a finalist for awards including Advancing Healthcare Awards 2014 and 2017, Abbvie Sustainable Healthcare Awards 2016.\n\nFor more about Squeezy and additional pelvic health information visit squeezyapp.com.\n\n*Apple Watch users*\nDuring your exercises you need to hold your finger on your Apple Watch face to keep it live and running. The play button changes to state ‘Hold’ when running an exercise.\n\nThis keeps your Watch from dozing off while your attention is focused on your pelvic floor. Most Watch screens go to sleep after 7 or 15 seconds (time dependent on your Watch settings). Squeezy has no control over the screen sleep time on the Watch; it has to obey your Watch settings. \n\nWe hope to be able to improve the Watch experience in future. In the meantime, we’re continuing the existing Watch support because many people find it helpful.\n\nIf you have feedback on the Apple Watch, please get in touch with the developers directly on help@squeezyapp.com.\n\n\nThis app has been translated into Saudi Arabian Arabic.\nتمت ترجمه هذا التطبيق الى اللغه العربيه ( المملكه العربيه السعوديه)‏"

The application has a suggested standard solution based on the schemes most used in intensive care services and allows editing and saving your favorite solutions.\n\nThe application also allows the creation of new solutions from the ampoules available in its service, the calculation of the dosage in mL/hour and the possibility of converting the infused speed into an infused concentration and vice versa. In addition, it is possible to view the therapeutic range individually for the patient's weight as guided by some medical bibliographies and the adjustment of this range by the user depending on the objective and clinical judgment. Thus, the application increases patient safety when prescribing these drugs reducing the risk of calculation errors by the professional.\n\nThe application also has messages to warn about photosensitive solutions and medications that must be diluted in a specific medium such as physiological solution or glucose solution, thus preventing changes in their therapeutic properties.\n\n\nThe application is available in english, portuguese and spanish."

This app will test your ability to identify electrocardiogram rhythms. Recognition of ECG rhythms as the wave forms sweep across a monitor screen is a different skill than diagnosing cardiac rhythms on a static tracing. This app will evaluate your resuscitation skills better than reviewing with a book because you have to diagnose the rhythms as they dynamically move across the screen.\n\nThe app utilizes an organized four Criteria approach to identify the rhythms. You can also study the Description of the rhythm to review the electrophysiology. Use the same process to test yourself and review all the ECG rhythms.\n\nWhen you feel you have mastered the rhythms in this program you should review the American Heart Association Advanced Cardiac Life Support algorithms using the app Anesoft 'ACLS Sim 2016'."

We've thoroughly tested the app in our own daily routines over the past year, and can't imagine not having this app anymore.\n\nWe've double-checked calculations many times and automated everything including tube feeding formulas where possible, so you don't have to. \n\n\nScreen 1: Quick Nutrition Needs --\nQuickly determine BMI, IBW, kcal needs (both MSJ and Penn State, for on or off ventilation), and protein needs. Easily account for stress factor and protein multipliers.\n\nScreen 2: Instant Tube Feeds --\nDetermine total volume, kcal, gm protein, %kcal protein, gm CHO, %kcal CHO, and mL free H2O in literally seconds. \n\nScreen 3: Parental Nutrition (TPN) calculator --\nInput rate and duration, and either grams or percentage dextrose/amino acids/lipids to determine total volume, kcal, gm protein, gm CHO, GIR, and gm fat/kg. Works for both 2-in-1 and 3-in-1 methods.\n\n\nWe made this app to fulfill our own biggest painpoints, but after realizing how indispensable it's become to us, we hope it's helpful for others now too. \n\nFeedback from clinical RDs is welcome!

Specifically, this App allows the user to document, store, recall, or change the equipment needs, set-up, and procedure needs for physicians involved in challenging patient care procedures.\n\nThe Preference Card® app user can: create and recall files, perform in-app editing, date stamp edits, document and photograph equipment needs and procedure notes to a specific physician and/or procedure. The Photos are useful in documenting Mayo or Back Table set-up, patient positioning, or unusual equipment needs. All photos can be custom labeled.\n\nEmails of specific files created through the Preference Card® App can be sent to other Preference Card® App end users. These emails will automatically integrate the files into the App of the recipient. Further, in-app emails and phone calls can be made to Vendor Representatives through the App software.\n\nThe Preference Card® App will prove useful in cross training OR staff, educating Surgical Technology Students, and in orienting new Surgical Technologists or Circulating Nurses. Special Procedure areas also use the Preference Card® app. So, whether procedures occur in the OR, ER, IR, Endoscopy, or Clinic...the Preference Card® app is the information overload solution.\n\nPreference Card® now features a new function to make finding your Preference Card® files easier! App users can now color code their Preference Card® files to allow grouping by specialty. Users can select the color they wish to group surgeons in alphabetic order within a color coded specialty. This inexpensive, in-app purchase is ideal for Surgical Technicians who cover multiple specialties or who cover call and need to be prepared for any type of surgical procedure."

Standard medical assessment, diagnosis, treatment, and specific evacuation considerations for many traumatic, medical, and environmental illnesses routinely encountered while in the back country are also presented comprehensively.\n\nIn addition, extensive content on subjective decision-making errors, first aid kit recommendations, patient assessment, medications and pain management, trip checklist functions, and cardiac arrest management are included.\nMany accidents in the back country can be avoided, and a main focus in this app is on prevention strategies. Significant content unique to this app is the inclusion of “trip checklists”. Checklists have been utilized for a long time in the aviation industry to prevent and react to critical situations, so that important steps are not missed. In this app, the checklists are intended to ritualize discussion of, and provide a framework for, the consideration of common subjective decision-making errors and heuristic factors before, during, and after a trip. Most accidents, or medical care that results in a worse outcome for the patient, will prove to be significantly attributable to these factors, rather than solely a failure of the acquisition or performance of the right skills and knowledge.\n\nThis app is mainly geared to the person with little or no medical training, up to a person with a Wilderness EMT, but even people who routinely practice medicine may find useful information within the app regarding environmental illness, subjective decision-making errors, and checklist functions when venturing into the backcountry. Commonly accepted wilderness protocols normally considered outside the scope of non-physician or pre-hospital care providers are contained within. These treatments are the administration of epinephrine for anaphylaxis or asthma, administration of glucagon injection for patients with extremely low blood sugar, reduction of shoulder, patella, or finger dislocation, evaluation of the spine for injury, cessation of CPR, avalanche resuscitation, tourniquet conversion and wound management, which may be performed with direction from a programmatic physician advisor following training.\n\n1. Functions well outside with offline capability. \n2. Text size may be conveniently increased.  \n3. Links contained within take you to relevant content referenced, like   \n    medical information.\n 4. Real life case studies included to illustrate key points about different \n     content."

      "label": "The \"Voice Meter Pro\" app for the iPad, iPhone and iPod touch, is a simple, but effective app that helps children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD's), voice disorders, or any other child (or adult) monitor the volume of their own voice in a Fun and Engaging way.\n\nChildren with Asperger’s and other ASD’s often have difficulties producing the appropriate voice volume in different settings.  Some children on the autism spectrum speak too quietly.  Others speak too loudly.  Still others do not compensate adequately for the social milieu or ambient noise level. \n\nUnderstanding abstract concepts, such as the volume of one’s voice, can be difficult for children with ASD's.  It’s well understood that adding a visual component to the otherwise abstract concept can often be very helpful for individuals with ASD.\n\nOK so how does the app work?\n\nWell….if a child is talking to quietly a blue background with a cartoon character struggling to hear is displayed. If a child is talking too loudly the background changes to red and the character puts it’s fingers in its ears. If the volume level is acceptable a green background with a smiling happy character is displayed.\n\n• The on screen “volume thermometer” dynamically displays the volume level as it changes. \n\n• There’s a \"Sensitivity\" slider so the adult can adjust the volume sensitivity to suit both the user and the environment.\n\n• There’s also a \"Dampening\" slider. This helps avoid the meter bouncing around in between words by introducing a slight delay before any movement is shown on the “volume\" thermometer.\n\n• To give the user total control over the app the Upper and Lower limits of the \"Green\" (acceptable volume area) can now be adjusted by the user.\n\n• For convenience the app works in both portrait and landscape modes on all the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad.\n\n•  the iPhone version of the app has a switch to enable the iPhone to vibrate should the upper threshold level be exceeded for longer than 4 seconds.\n\nWe want to make this app the very best it can be and to this end we have included a feedback form inside the app for users to submit any issues or suggestions as to how it can be improved. \n\nWhy not download the app and give it a try?...... you might find it a very useful tool."

Having trouble explaining the exact course of the fever to the pediatrician? Keep track of body temperatures and medication for your whole family with Feevy.\n\n\nTEMPERATURE, MEDICATION AND NOTES\nWith Feevy you can not only record temperature measurements, but also track medications and enter text notes. This way, you can verify if medication was effective and capture additional information, e.g. regarding the patient’s condition. Be perfectly prepared for your next visit to the doctor!\n\nBEAUTIFUL CHARTS\nEntering data is worthless if you can’t analyze it later. Feevy comes with a beautiful and very detailed interactive chart, which makes it easy to get a quick overview, as well as to analyze temperature curves in more detail. You can freely zoom and pan it to see all the details you need.\n\nPRINT AND SHARE YOUR DATA\nOf course you can also print and export your data. This way you can bring your fever curve with you to the doctor or even send it via e-mail. The PDF contains all measurements, medications and notes, as well as a full-page chart showing the temperature curve.\n\nTRACK MULTIPLE PEOPLE\nFeevy lets you track the fever curves for multiple people. It is perfect for keeping track of your children's conditions and illnesses. To represent your family with some personality, Feevy comes with a set of cute profile icons to choose from.\n\nSYNC WITH FAMILY MEMBERS\nEspecially if you use Feevy to track your kids' illnesses, you will appreciate its sync functionality. No matter who measures the temperature or administers medication, both parents will always see the same data on their devices.\n\nUNIVERSAL APP\nFeevy supports both iPhone and iPad, including iPad multitasking (Slide Over and Split View). Use your iPhone while on the go or to quickly enter a new measurement, and use the iPad to have a detailed look at the charts.\n\n\nFeedback is always welcome: feedback@feevyapp.com or via Twitter @feevyapp.\n\n\nIMPORTANT\nIn case of fever and sickness, please always consult your doctor. Using this app to track body temperature and symptoms is not a substitute for a visit to the doctor!\n\nOF COURSE YOU CANNOT MEASURE YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE WITH THIS APP! You can only record, visualize and archive the measurements obtained with a fever thermometer."

This professional cognitive training app takes a familiar format for treating left neglect and transforms it into a dynamic, interactive tool for all ages. Visual Attention Therapy offers benefits that can only be achieved through technology: \n\n* Targets must be tapped from left to right, top to bottom in Practice mode, which trains users to slow down and scan the entire screen before they move on.\n* Immediate feedback with visual and auditory cues keeps users engaged.\n* Timed exercises increase motivation to work quickly and accurately.\n* Stop wasting time counting errors! Automated scoring includes data for accuracy by quadrant, time for completion, and mistakes in professional e-mailed reports.\n* Adjustable layouts and 10 levels of difficulty allow you to customize the experience to meet changing needs or multiple users.\n* Sidebar signal can flash in a variety of colors to draw attention to the left or right.\n* An endless variety of combinations eliminates the need to photocopy exercises, with the option to print screenshots when you need a traditional exercise.\n* Use only one target to focus on scanning, or use two targets at once to challenge users with working memory and alternating attention deficits. \n\n-----------\n\nRACE AGAINST THE CLOCK to improve scores while improving cognitive and reading skills.

      "label": "Taking the deaf world by storm and featured in the news, Deafwake was created by a deaf person and is designed to ensure everyone can get up when they’re supposed to. Removing the risk of sleeping in and being late for meetings, it allows deaf individuals or heavy sleepers to be on time, every time. \n\nDeaf Wake, an LED / Vibration / Visual based alarm app for people who are deaf, hearing Impaired or just want a really cool alarm clock.\n\nThis deaf app will be your best friend as well as your worse enemy (if you don't like being woken up) It is designed to utilise all the senses of your iPhone. It has a flashing screen, it vibrates, it uses the camera flash and is loud.\n\nThe app has hit all four corners of the globe, including the UK, USA, Australia, Germany, Ireland, Denmark, Canada, Norway, Switzerland, and Mexico. And with more than 1,000 downloads on the App Store, and over 500,000 Facebook users reached, the app has proven to be a huge hit with those who struggle daily with the realities of being deaf or hard of hearing. \n\nSee video of app in action - https://www.facebook.com/deafwake/#\n\n*********************\n\nThe App has an easy interface where you can select the camera flash, have a flashing screen, have it vibrate or use sound. You may select one or two or even use all the senses of your iPhone.\n\nNot all senses may be appropriate for every scenario for an example during a work meeting you may not want the phone to rudely interrupt you by sound or vibration. A discreet flashing screen telling you that your child needs to be picked up from nursery may be more appropriate.\n\n*********************\n\nBe Alert /////\nNever be late again. Never burn the Sunday roast. Never miss meetings. All because you didn't hear the phone (or didn't feel it vibrating)\n\nChoose Your Senses /////\nChoose the flashing screen. Just have the phone vibrate. Set the camera flash. Be alerted by sound. Or have all four turned on.\n\nDescriptive Alarms /////\nUniquely give each alarm setting a description. A description could be 'Make your partner a cup of tea to get out of the doghouse'\n\nMade By A Deaf Person /////\nAn app designed by a hearing impaired person with deaf people in mind (or just plain heavy sleepers)\n\nApple Watch /////\nThe App is also designed to work with the Apple Watch. You can use the Apple Watch to also set your alarms as well as other features.\n\nChoose Clock Interfaces /////\nChoose from a selection of two clock faces. Simply swipe left or right. You may prefer an easier analogue clock.\n\n*********************\n\nNo longer do you have to put the phone under your pillow or in your pocket in order to (hopefully) be woken up. At night put the iPhone at the side of the bed and let it flash to wake you up (using the flashing screen and camera flash). Put the iPhone on the kitchen table whilst chopping carrots to remind you to take the roast out of the oven. Settle down, watch a movie and let the App tell you when its time to go to bed.\n\n*********************\n\nAs a long life deaf person I have been frustrated with the lack of innovation designed for deaf people in technology. One problem I have had is a suitable alarm clock or timer that appropriately notifies me. This App was born out of frustration and was initially just developed for my own personal use.\n\nSteven Mifsud\nDeafWake Designer \n\n*********************\n\nFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK - https://www.facebook.com/deafwake\n\nWhat are you waiting for!\n\nGet this superb app today\n\nFor less than a price of coffee, download this App today and be amazed! Tell your friends and family, please do be sure to leave a review on the Apple AppStore.\n\nNOTE - App must be running. Set the alarm and put the phone facedown (so screen goes black), upright or in your pocket etc. Don't turn phone off via the switch or home button as it is not possible to bypass the notification system when the iPhone is locked. This is the same for ALL Apps and other alarm clocks.\n\n*********************"

It will change how you prep for your AEMT certification exam and increase the chance you pass the NREMT the first time.\n\n525 Review questions are broken up into 5 major areas of study: Airway, Oxygen and Ventilation, Cardiology, Trauma, Medical and Operations. Questions in each section will provide a no-nonsense audio rationale by Bill Brown. Use these sections to determine your readiness--and to help focus your study.\n\nWhen you are ready to try a simulated exam we have two, 135-question practice NRAEMT exams to test your overall knowledge and prepare you to take the NRAEMT. Our AEMT PASS Predictive Scoring process can predict if you will pass (or not), based on how well you do on the practice exams.\n\nUnique to the PASS apps is the chance to hear Bill. Throughout the AEMT PASS app, he'll give you tips and tricks for studying for the NREMT and describe what you can expect on the actual test."

      "label": "Bilateral Stimulation Therapy (BLST) is a neuropsychological treatment adapted from a treatment called EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing). EMDR is a gold standard treatment according to the World Health Organisation for the psychological treatment of trauma. Bilateral Stimulation is a key therapeutic tool used in EMDR. \n\nBilateral Stimulation simply means stimulation of both sides of the brain using eye movements, sound or tactile stimulation. Typically, it may involve moving your eyes from left to right whilst following a target or paying attention to sound in your left ear then to your right. Bilateral stimulation is referred to as a ‘bottom – up’ approach as it works on the emotion engine of the brain, the limbic system. This approach reduces emotional distress which allows the cortical areas of the brain (thinking, reasoning, planning) to become more active and effective. The effect of this approach is often experienced more quickly and easily.\n\nBecause this therapy uses one element of EMDR, it is called BLST so as to not confuse or give the user a wrong impression about the complete standard EMDR therapy. BLST uses one part of EMDR, and therefore 2can be practiced at home, work or any quiet environment where you can spend five minutes or so undisturbed much like meditation. For more information about BLST and EMDR please visit www.mromeopsych.com/blst\n\nThis minimal app uses bilateral click which, when activated, sounds alternately in each ear. The speed, tone and length of the practice can be set by the user. The App has two options: 1. BLST mode (bilateral stimulation with sound) and 2. FLASH (an adaption of Dr Phillip Manfield’s FLASH technique. Please visit https://www.flashtechnique.com for more information).\n\nThis app is a clinical tool for psychologists, psychiatrists, EMDR therapists and their patients. While information is provided at www.mromeopsych.com/blst, you should consult your EMDR therapist before using it. Please note: Persons suffering with complex PTSD Dissociative Identity Disorder, Borderline Personality, Schizophrenia or unstable neurological conditions (eg; epilepsy) should not use this product without consultation with your therapist.\n\nAs we are frequently updating this app to improve it’s functionality and increase its features, we ask that any comments or suggestions that you have, please contact us at admin@mromeopsych.com. Thank you."

What's the cost of my driving?\nBased on gas price for a gallon or litre, MPG (U.S. or UK) or liters per 100 km the app will tell you what the cost is as you drive. You can add an extra cost per kilometer or mile! Useful for all cost aware drivers and for splitting the cost between passengers.\n\n‣‣ GPS TRACKING. Where I've been? How long did it take to get from A to B? \nSpeedometer records your trip statistics even when GPS tracker is switched off. When you need point by point data to see on the map later or export (Google Earth and GPX), speedometer gives you the first class GPS tracker.\n\n‣‣ INFOTAINMENT. \nWhen switched on, infotainment shows trip stats or weather/wind forecast  when you wait. Way better than just showing you a 0 speed!\n\n‣‣ Easy to set speed limits and SPEED LIMIT MEMORY option\nSet speed limits with 4 or 8 fast and configurable presets. Presets only need a single tap and are the safest way to set the limits! With SPEED LIMIT MEMORY you just apply the speed limit once and the app applies it for you automatically the next time!\n\n‣‣ MODES\nUse MENU>MODES to turn the app into a Rally computer, G-Force monitor, Camera alerter or taximeter! Currently there are 12 modes available and we are constantly adding new ones.\n\n‣‣ WAYPOINTS.\nSpeedometer gives you the unique way to leave a note with location and even optional photo or audio note attached! As easy as double tap on the big speed digits! You'll find more in a documentation section (star button).\n\n‣‣ RED LIGHT & SPEED CAMERAS\nImport camera data into speedometer in Garmin or iGO csv formats from poi-factory.com, scdb.info or poi-plaza and let speedo alert you on a camera approach and set speed limit automatically before you pass the speed camera!\n\n‣‣ SUNSET/SUNRISE\nWith the sunset and sunrise information that our speedometer provides, you'll be able to avoid driving in the dusk.\n\n‣‣ BARO VSI. Barometric Vertical Speed Indicator (VSI, IVSI) in both scale and graph forms.\n\n‣‣ VOICE COACH. When enabled and configured, voice coach will be telling you active track distance and duration as well as current speed and altitude.\n\n‣‣ MAPS. Google's native, Apple map, Blank map and Offline maps.\n\n‣‣ Siri shortcuts: New Track, Stop Track, Speed limits.\n\n+ UNIVERSAL APP. Speedometer for iPhone and cellular iPads. All in retina graphics.\n\n+ 000-999 SPEED AND LIMIT RANGE. MPH, KM/H AND KNOTS. Maximum/TOP, average speed, distance traveled.\n\n+ BACKGROUND MODE! Speedometer will work in background if told so and will still warn you with audio alert when exceed a preset speed limit. You can use other apps while speedometer does its job in the background!\n\n+ PRIVACY. Speedometer never shares your location data with 3rd parties or ad agencies. Location data is used solely for tracking your speed and recording the GPS tracks and never leave the app unless you decide to share by means of a track export. It always let you know when background mode is on and never runs in background unless it is explicitly told to do so.\n\n! You can use this app on your iPhone as well as on any cellular iPad. **App will not work properly on iPods and wifi only iPads as they don't have GPS (external GPS module is required). \n! Please note that as with all GPS apps, continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nDrive safely, keep the log and notes and avoid paying those speeding fines!

      "label": "2022-2023 Season New York State Snowmobile Association (NYSSA) Mobile App\r\n\r\nHelp support snowmobiling in New York State by purchasing the New York State Snowmobile Association (NYSSA) Mobile App! A portion of the proceeds go to NYSSA to promote snowmobiling and other snowmobile club projects in New York State.\r\n\r\nThe NYSSA mobile app brings current snowmobile trail information and points of interest into live online and OFFLINE map capabilities. This is far from a static map as NYSSA’s 200+ clubs have LIVE access to update trail status as well as add warnings, reroutes and points of interest through their administrative access. Clubs also have access to add their own local trails, with new trails being added and updated regularly.\r\n\r\nSome of the highlights of the app:\r\n\r\n-Choose between both online (live updates) and OFFLINE maps. Offline maps updates are available daily.\r\n-See your current location and heading, allowing the app to follow your location.\r\n-Breadcrumb tracking of current location and new navigation mode.\r\n-View current trail status (open, closed, unreported), closures, and reroutes\r\n-Find fuel, food, lodging, parking and ride locations, parts and service, and scenic or points of interest recommended by NYSSA and clubs.\r\n-Click on trails or points of interest to see more information\r\n-Measure distances and areas\r\n-Choose between multiple basemaps including imagery\r\n-Search for locations and address\r\n-Toggle layers on and off\r\nPlease contact us (email link within the app) with suggestions for future updates. We look forward to working with the snowmobile community in our future development efforts!\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n*Trail status, reroutes, and related points are maintained by the clubs and may not always be accurate.\r\n**Continued use of GPS will quickly drain battery life. It is recommended to turn off GPS when not required or plug into a power source during extended use.\r\n***This purchase is for the 2022-2023 season. The app will continue to work through October 2023, and will time out on November 1st, 2023. Another purchase is required for the 2023-2024 season***"

      "label": "Theodolite is a multi-function viewfinder that combines a compass, two-axis inclinometer, rangefinder, GPS, map, nav calculator, and geo-overlay photo/movie camera into one indispensable app. Theodolite was one of the very first augmented reality (AR) apps when it was released in 2009, and it’s been downloaded and used by millions of customers since then. Uses are endless, and the app is great for land measurements, outdoor sports, sightseeing, navigation, and finding your way around. Theodolite is a pro grade app and is used extensively by surveyors, geologists, architects, engineers, competitive sportsmen, first responders, military personnel, and search and rescue workers around the world. \n\nTheodolite lets you take data-overlay photos and movies with 2X-8X zoom. Overlay geographical data, angle markings, date/time, author/company info, and project notes directly on photos and movies for later reference. The same data is written into the metadata record of images, making image files self-contained data records. Third-party apps can tap into Theodolite's advanced camera functions with a camera sharing feature.\n\nView current position on the built-in map with optional offline Outdoors maps that include topo contours, roads, trails, landmarks, campgrounds, ski lifts, and more. Live map markers continually update distance/heading relative to the current location and also show wayfinding info in the main viewfinder. Draw polygons on the map to mark things like property boundaries and trails, and import/export polygon data via KML.\n\nShare map markers and nav calculator points with other users of Theodolite via text messages or e-mail. This powerful capability opens up a wide range of collaborative uses including team land surveying, accident investigations, spotting wild fires, triangulation of landmarks, and advanced tactical observation and targeting. With an optional in-app purchase to enable team tracking, you can share location with up to 20 people on Theodolite's map.\n\nTheodolite includes features for serious users like a reference angle mode, nav calculator, map marker import/export, manual and automatic data logging with CSV and KML export, clipboard integration, %grade display, mil compass readout, optical rangefinders (including a mil-based reticle, sniper-style stadiametric graphs, and a variable 4X-24X scope), and night filters to improve use in dark conditions.\n\nTheodolite can provide location in military grid reference system (MGRS) coordinates, Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates, British/Irish National Grids, US National Grid, Maidenhead locator system, Map Grid of Australia, and six latitude/longitude formats. Optional US State Plane coordinates include SPCS27 and SPCS83 zones covering all US States. The optional Datum Pack adds over 230 geodetic datums to the app to improve position computation from GPS data, covering regions and countries on all continents around the world.\n\nAR Layers include navigational aids like the sun, moon, planets, and Polaris (North star), and the optional US Mountain Summits layer that shows over 70,000 US mountain summits in the viewfinder.\n\nTheodolite has been shown in Apple Keynotes, featured on the App Store, and has been a #1 selling Navigation app in App Stores around the world. Since its introduction in 2009, Theodolite has defined augmented reality navigation. The app continually introduces new technologies, pushing the limits of iOS app development and taking advantage of new hardware capabilities.\n\nFind out why Apple named Theodolite one of the most amazing apps available and showed it being used to explore the Great Wall of China. Where will you take it on your next adventure?\n\nNote: Theodolite is an iPhone app -- see “Theodolite HD” for use on an iPad. And be sure to check out the all-new \"Theodolite for Watch\" and put Theodolite on your wrist!"

      "label": "This app puts the Mayan Dreamspell Calendar in your pocket! \"13:20:Sync makes it so much easier to understand and integrate the calendar into every day life. Highly recommend it.\" \n\nThe Mayan People have described, in breathtaking precision, the cycles of both the universe and nature around us. They created a harmonic calendar that is synchronized to all those cycles. Following these cycles can help you get a stronger connection with nature around you and become conscious of your essence.\n\nThis app provides a simple way to sync along those cycles, to raise our frequency and give us a new lens to view both our day-to-day and planetary events.\n\n- Did you ever realize that our (Gregorian) calendar is not a harmonic calendar? \n- Did you know that the moon has 13 (not 12!) orbits around the earth in 1 year? \n- Why do we live with this irregular calendar?\n- Are you interested in Astrology?\n\n-> All this, and more, is explained carefully in this app. (over 15.000 words on 37 pages) Please note that these text are in English language only.\n\nIn the New Time, synchronicity is the norm.\n\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// \n5 star rating across the world! \n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// \n\"Entertaining as well as enlightening\" \n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// \n\nMORE INFO: \nwww.1320sync.com \n\n\nFor the beginner this app is a learning tool because it contains an extensive explanation about Tones and Seals and the synchronizing order of the Mayan Astrology. You may think it's difficult at first but soon you will feel how it all connects. \n\n\"This app is great, and allows easy manipulation of dates. I spent years in books doing in hours what I can now do in seconds.\"\n\nFor the ones who are already familiar with the Mayan Calendar this app is a handy tool to navigate the cycles, and calculate the Combined Kin for any given combination. Furthermore this app can be of great assistance to teach other people about the 13:20 cycles and is used in teachings around the world.\n\n\n=== FEATURES ===\n\n+ Kin Calendar\nThis is your main Mayan Dreamspell Calendar Dashboard with all the details you need to stay in sync.

Watch in full screen, view in AR, search, add filters and so much more!\n\nShip Finder has been top rated and top ranking since 2009 and covers most of the world, tracking 20,000+ ships simultaneously.\n\nOur incredible app performance means that you can see all tracked vessels at once - no clustering here!\nSimply tap a ship to see its name, type, photos, speed, dimensions and much more.\nPowerful features such as filters, search and the ability to save favourite ships are included. (You can choose Apple or Google maps too!).\n\nAdd and browse bookmarks to saved locations around the globe to quickly navigate to areas or ports of interest.\n\nYou can even use Augmented Reality (AR) view to identify ships out at sea using your device camera. \n\nShip Finder works by picking up AIS ship feeds used by all passenger vessels, vessels over 300 tons and increasingly by smaller pleasure craft and yachts. This technology is actually faster than radar and is used by vessels for safety and navigation.\n\nShip Finder provides near real time “virtual radar” AIS maps. It’s easy to use and is an amazing app for anyone interested in shipping, cruising and sailing in ports and locations across the world. It’s also great if you simply want to know what boats are out there or want to see where your friends and family are. Ship Finder is also used extensively by maritime professionals and mariners.\n\nOur global AIS coverage is impressive and expanding all of the time as we add new AIS feeds and receivers. Please check www.shipfinder.co regularly to see the latest coverage.\n\nPinkfroot are committed to customer service and continually improve our Ship Finder apps based on feedback. Why not join our online community at www.pinkfroot.com or if you have any questions please email us via support@pinkfroot.com and we’ll be happy to help. \n\nDisclaimer: Ship Finder should not be used for navigational purposes. \nUnder no circumstances will the developer of this application be held responsible for incidents resulting from the use of the data or its interpretation."

      "label": "Theodolite was one of the earliest augmented reality (AR) apps for iOS when it debuted in 2009 -- in fact Theodolite was pioneering AR technology before \"AR\" was even a buzzword! In the time since, Theodolite has been used by millions of consumers and professionals in their outdoor adventures and on the job. Now, we've taken the Theodolite concept to Apple Watch by combining a compass, inclinometer, GPS, and maps into one indispensable app that sits on your wrist. We're excited to keep evolving this centuries-old instrument as hardware and software technologies allow the concept to come to new device formats.\n\nOn iPhone and iPad, Theodolite uses a viewfinder format, uniting the device sensors (GPS, magnetometer, gyro, accelerometer) and camera.  On Apple Watch, Theodolite combines data from these sensors into an AHRS (attitude and heading reference system) layout similar to what you'd see in the glass cockpit of a modern aircraft. This layout allows Theodolite to efficiently display compass bearing (yaw angle), pitch angle, and roll angle in a compact format that works extremely well on a small screen.  This information is augmented by latitude, longitude, and altitude from GPS, as well as sun and moon position.\n\nNew in Theodolite for Watch version 2 is a map screen and waypoint manager.  You can add waypoints on the map or at your current location, and view waypoints on the compass ring to visualize their bearing from your current location.\n\nTheodolite has settings for compass mode (true or magnetic), distance/altitude units (feet or meters), and position format (decimal degrees, degrees-minutes-seconds, MGRS, USNG, UTM, UTM-B, and Maidenhead Locator System).  Users can choose to display an artificial horizon in the center of the app display (tied to pitch and roll) and can set the app's level reference to flat or vertical orientations of the Watch.  The app has six color schemes, including two night vision modes - midnight red and luminescent green.\n\nTheodolite for Watch is recommended for Apple Watch Series 5 and later (including Ultra).  Apple Watch Series 4 and older do not have a compass sensor and will not show compass data.  On older devices, the app uses the device's gyro sensor to measure rotation.  You can twist the watch's digital crown to adjust and calibrate the gyro to the sun position, moon position, or a known bearing.  Using these references, the \"gyro compass\" is able to give bearing.  The calibration can be repeated as often as desired to give accurate results.\n\nTheodolite reports accuracy from the magnetometer sensor in your Watch.  To improve results, operate Theodolite away from magnets, electronics, or sources of electro-magnetic interference, including car dashboards, aircraft cockpits, metal structures, and other devices.\n\nLike all our apps, we plan to continually improve and evolve Theodolite for Watch.  Please contact us with feature requests, suggestions, and general feedback.  We'd love to hear what you're doing with the app!  And if you don't already have Theodolite for your iPhone or iPad, check it out!"

      "label": "The legendary iOS compass app is now available for Apple Watch!  Pro Compass replicates the look and feel of classic pocket compass hardware in use since the 1800s.  The app uses advanced graphics technologies (normally reserved for games) to render 3D floating compass hardware for realistic operation.\n\nPro Compass offers true and magnetic compass modes using a damped rosette-style compass ring.  Local sun and moon position are shown on the compass ring and continually updated.  Pro Compass also displays location and altitude, with decimal and degree-minute-second formats.  The app contains a built-in two-axis inclinometer that drives two independent bubble levels and a bullseye level. \n\nNew in Pro Compass for Watch version 2 is a map screen and waypoint manager.  You can add waypoints on the map or at your current location, and view waypoints on the compass ring to visualize their bearing from your current location.\n\nPro Compass has settings for compass mode (true or magnetic), distance/altitude units (feet or meters), and position format (decimal degrees, degrees-minutes-seconds, MGRS, USNG, UTM, UTM-B, and Maidenhead Locator System).  The app has six color schemes, including two night vision modes - midnight red and luminescent green.\n\nPro Compass for Watch is recommended for Apple Watch Series 5 and later (including Ultra).  Apple Watch Series 4 and older do not have a compass sensor and will not show compass data.  On older devices, the app uses the device's gyro sensor to measure rotation.  You can twist the watch's digital crown to adjust and calibrate the gyro to the sun position, moon position, or a known bearing.  Using these references, the \"gyro compass\" is able to give bearing.  The calibration can be repeated as often as desired to give accurate results.\n\nAccuracy note: Pro Compass reports accuracy from the magnetometer sensor in your watch.  To improve results, operate Pro Compass away from magnets, electronics, or sources of electro-magnetic interference, including car dashboards, aircraft cockpits, metal structures, and other devices.\n\nDeveloper note: like all our apps, we plan to continually improve and evolve Pro Compass for Watch.  Please contact us with feature requests, suggestions, and general feedback.  We'd love to hear what you're doing with the app!"

It is a great program that has been very useful to us. I think we have 60 pilots using iPhones and iNavX and your app links in so well.\"\n\n\"I am a ships Pilot in BC and use Aye Tides a lot and it has become invaluable.”\n\nYou can see the day’s events in tabular form, or you can rotate the phone for an interactive graph that shows you the tide’s value at any point during the day. You can find a station on a map, by name, or based on your current location.\n\nAyeTides is updated regularly and stations are added whenever we find new data. We encourage our customers to contact us if you hare having any issues with the program so that we can help you. \n\nThis app is designed to run on your iPhone or iPod Touch. While it will run on your iPad, it does not offer the additional features available with AyeTides XL, which was designed specifically for the iPad. If you have multiple devices, you may want to consider our bundle. You get both apps at a discount!\n\nThis is the only place to install AyeTides.

      "label": "BACKGROUND:\n\nBuilt from the ground up in the rugged mountains of eastern Afghanistan, Tactical NAV comes from the mind of a U.S. Army Field Artillery officer who had a vision of creating a low-cost and highly accurate tactical navigation platform built specifically for military service members.\n\nTactical NAV's journey began in the notorious Pech River Valley of Kunar Province, Afghanistan. \n\nU.S. Army Capt. Jonathan J. Springer, a Fire Support Officer with the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), began developing the tactical navigation platform following the memorial services for Spc. Blair D. Thompson and Spc. Jared C. Plunk, who were killed in action on June 25, 2010.\n\nAfter pitching the idea and being turned away by the Department of Defense on multiple occasions, Captain Springer remained resolute in his mission to continue developing Tactical NAV — even to this day. His ultimate goals were (and still are) to make a difference for other Soldiers and honor the men and women who were killed and wounded in battle.\n\nHe ended up using his life savings to continue moving forward with the Tactical NAV project, all with the ultimate hope of saving military lives and helping his fellow service members accomplish their mission at home and abroad.\n\nTactical NAV officially launched on the App Store on February 14, 2011.\n\nMISSION:\n\nTactical NAV's mission is to provide military service members with a low-cost, highly accurate, and exceedingly powerful mobile tactical navigational solution.\n\nVISION:\n\nOur vision is to assist and support our nation's service members with their mobile navigational needs and further enable them to operate and win during Multi-Domain Operations (MDO).\n\nBUILT FOR ACCURACY:\n\nTactical NAV's performance is on par with the AN/PSN-13 Defense Advanced GPS Receiver (DAGR), and it has the feedback to prove it.\n\nBOTTOM LINE:\n\nPurpose-built by Soldiers and created to save military lives, Tactical NAV was the very first MGRS-focused app on the App Store. It has proven to be effective across a multitude of environments all throughout the world.\n\nTactical NAV has been successfully evaluated against other software platforms and devices such as Nett Warrior, JCR, BFT, JBC-P, and ATAK. Its accuracy is within 1-to-3 meters of these officially approved systems issued by the Department of Defense.\n\nIAPs & SUBSCRIPTIONS: \n\nTactical NAV contains in-app purchases (IAPs) and subscriptions. Currently, tactical drawing mode is available as an in-app purchase, and offline mapping is also available to users as either a monthly or yearly subscription. All revenue generated from these features goes towards further developmental coding and updates, and a portion of all proceeds are donated to charities that specifically benefit disabled veterans.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n• A military-quality precision targeting platform\n• Purpose-built for the individual Soldier\n• Offline mapping capabilities (complete usage of the TACNAV platform with no emission of a cellular signal)\n• WGS 84 standard (MGRS, UTM, BNG, and USNG coordinates)\n• Tactical drawing mode (e.g., useful for Joint Fires planning, creating overlays, route planning, and so forth)\n• Waypoint plotting functionality with military graphics (per FM 1-02.2)\n• Compass \"FastLock\" function for capturing quick azimuths\n• Snap and save photographs onto the main map for intelligence purposes and AARs\n• Location, waypoint, and photo-sharing capabilities (via email and text)\n• One-button night mode function for low-light situations \n• \"Go to Grid\" option for intelligent pinpoint planning and drawing of overlays\n• Created and tested to ensure utmost accuracy and reliability \n• iOS native code built for austere and contested environments\n• And so much more!!!\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES:\n \nThe Department of Defense does not endorse Tactical NAV, nor should it be used in life-threatening or combat situations in place of a government-issued device."

As with the other platforms, the iOS map includes an index to more than 1,000 backcountry locations in Utah’s Central Wasatch mountains. It is the must-have app for Utah hikers and backcountry travelers. \n\nWith a familiar map-app interface, the Wasatch Backcountry Skiing Map accesses your device’s GPS to display your current location on a high-resolution topo map. And with only a few taps, the “destination arrow” on the integrated compass will point to your desired backcountry ski location.\n\nAnd with a single tap, hundreds of the locations will open the Wasatch Backcountry Skiing Guide website where you can view photographs and detailed information about the location.\n\nThe app also displays your current elevation and lat/long, and will send your current location via email. And with a tap, you can display detailed information on more than 200 of the locations including skiing difficulty, skinning distance, vertical climb, parking considerations, and more.\n\n(Contrary to a posted review, you don't need cell service to use this app--you don't even need a contract with a cell service provider.)\n\nNOTICES: When navigating, the “destination arrow” points directly to the destination without regard to hazards such as avalanche paths, cliffs, and rock fall. It is your responsibility to travel in the backcountry safely."

You may already know some of the iconic landmarks and wildernesses that the US has to offer, but did you know that there are millions of acres of public Bureau of Land Management property in the Western US? This app is your guide to discovering the unspeakable beauty and recreational potential that is contained within these fabled domains!\n\nWhether you are a seasoned forest wanderer or are just wanting to learn a little more about the amazing places surrounding your home turf, this app is for you! The data is up to date as of Summer, 2022, and contains over 53,000 recreational points and other features on BLM land. These points are symbolized with several color-coded icons that differentiate between the . Categories include Access Points, Boating, Campgrounds, POIs, Vistas, Bathrooms, Parking Lots, Recreational Areas, and much more! The app even distinguishes property boundaries and includes some hiking trails and roads.\n\nNew in this release! We listened to your requests and have added several improvements and new features including a custom My Points tool! Now you can save your own points of interest and give them a unique color and icon. Mark where you park the car, where you saw a neat feature, or an epic campsite. You can even export these points for use with other devices!\n\nOnce using the app, there are five screens. The Guide screen will provide data legends as well as helpful tips for optimizing your navigational experience. On the Info screen, you will find a number of spatial links to the different BLM properties. This is a great way to quickly locate specific places and discover new places to explore! The About screen provides links to all of the open-source resources used in the app and gives a little information about the developer GeoPOI. The Map Settings screen is where you can change between one of four different basemaps, download offline imagery, turn on geolocation, and toggle specific point categories. Finally, the Map screen is where it all comes together!\n\nOn the Map screen, there are a series of circle clusters at distant zooms that indicate how many points are within a given cluster. As you tap the clusters to zoom in, individual points and icons become visible, along with trails, roads, and boundaries. These features can be clicked on to reveal the name, location, and other useful information. The map screen also has two search tools - the left one can be used to look up addresses and towns, while the right one will allow you to query the names of the features in the database.\n\nThere is such a wealth of beauty out there waiting to be discovered. Never before has it been this easy to navigate our public lands as you travel, no matter where in the United States you are or what kinds of places you are interested in visiting. It's time to experience the rich natural and cultural tapestry of our nation and pay homage to the places that make our country the great land that it is. Come navigate the US BLM lands with GeoPOI today!"

      "label": "Save time and money on your instrument flight training by mastering IFR holding pattern entries at the comfort of your own mobile device.\n\nMake IFR flight training easier!\n\nIs the following scenario familiar? You receive a holding clearance from ATC, and only have a couple of minutes, sometimes only a few seconds, to choose the correct entry. By the time you've figured out what's going on, you've already passed the holding fix and don't know what to do next.\n\nIf this sounds familiar, then you need not to worry. Confusion during holding entries happens to practically almost every new instrument student. Even instrument-rated pilots occasionally have the same problem — when they don't get enough practice.\n\nHolding Trainer solves this problem and as a result, cuts the time you have to spend on expensive flight and ground lessons. With Holding Trainer, you can practice on your own time and convenience, so that choosing the best holding entry in the air becomes a breeze. \n\n\nFeatures: \n\n-Entry Trainer - Drills you on choosing the best holding entry. Practice until choosing holding entries becomes second nature and impress your flight instructor with your skills.\n\n-Holding calculator. Solve and visualize any holding scenario by entering your current bearing to the fix and a outbound or inbound holding radial. \n\n-Holding tutorial - learn how to choose the best holding entry quickly and easily.\n\nHolding Trainer for iOS is a complete rewrite based on my popular Flash-based desktop Holding Trainer app available on pilotscafe.com.\n\n***Don't get \"stuck\" next time you receive a holding pattern clearance!***\n----------------------------------\nFor only a fraction of the cost of one ground lesson with your flight instructor, you can practice this important instrument skill at your own pace and save hundreds of Dollars on figuring out holding entries in the air.\n\nThis is a great tool for anyone training towards their instrument checkride, CFII, proficiency check, or simply trying to improve their holding patterns.\n----------------------------------"

Perfect for travelers - research where you're covered across the USA (and now Canada!!) \n\n** Follow our Facebook page to get update alerts: http://www.facebook.com/CoverageMapApp, or check our support page**\n\nCoverage? focuses on helping mobile bandwidth junkies find cell signal as they roam.  Save time looking up coverage on the carrier's websites, compare their claims head to head and better plan your travels to stay connected. \n\n** The carrier's maps in your pocket: This app contains regional level maps based off of each major carrier's data map - as found on their website as of our last update. Quickly overlay the carriers you use to create your own personalized coverage map on your device. \n\n** No internet needed: Our proprietary coverage maps are stored within the app on your device - no downloading needed! Quickly access where you're supposed to get a signal, even when you have none. \n\n** Urban and rural areas: Maps are at a regional level, and cover the entire continental USA, Canada, Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands.\n\n** Carriers included: AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, US Cellular.\n** Canadian Carriers: Bell, Telus, Rogers (optional unlock)\n\n** Know where to roam: view 5G, LTE, and roaming areas as overlays, focus on finding the coverage type you desire. \n\nCheck http://www.twostepsbeyond.com/apps/coverage for a quick video demo.\n\nWe created this app because we are full time 'technomads' ourselves who rely on mobile data to work remotely. Keeping this app updated is a priority for us, as we depend on it ourselves!\n\n--------------\nCoverage FAQ: \nQ: Why aren't the maps more detailed or released more often? \nA: Our map updates require a lot of meticulous labor intensive processing. There's just no practical way to issue a new update every time a new tower is turned on. We monitor new coverage and try to find balance between effort & staying current.  This generally means at least a couple updates a year. \n\nQ: What makes 'Coverage?' unique? \nA: There are great apps out there that collect user submitted signal reports - we recommend them and use them ourselves. However, those apps are only useful in markets with an active user base. We took a different approach with Coverage? - we needed a tool to at least give us an idea of where signal should be - urban, rural, and out in the boonies.\n\n--------------\n\nNamed 'Essential Tool' by Wired Magazine\n\n** Winner - 'Most Useful App' - iOSDevCamp  \n\n\"this app can be indispensable\" - Lifehacker.com\n\n--------------\n\nThe maps in 'Coverage?' are provided in partnership with Ookla, and represent proprietary interpretations of the coverage reported by each carrier. You should not rely on the maps in Coverage to be perfectly precise or absolutely timely.  \n\nOngoing map updates have been free - but to support the ongoing development costs, we now allow customers to subscribe to higher resolution maps that will be updated more frequently. \n\nCoverage does not report or predict signal strength (there are great apps out there for that!). We can make no promises as to where you'll *actually* get signal.. there are too many variables - towers, device, terrain, weather, etc.\n\nSo… Got Coverage?\n\nAdditional information about The HD Maps Subscription:\n\nThis is an auto-renewable subscription, with a duration of one year. \n\nThe subscription fee will be charged to your iTunes account upon confirmation of purchase, and will automatically renew each year unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours prior to the end of the current subscription period.\n\nCurrent subscriptions may not be canceled during the active subscription period; however, you can manage your subscription and/or turn off auto-renewal by visiting your iTunes Account Settings after purchase.\n\nTerms of Use and Privacy Policy: http://www.twostepsbeyond.com/privacy/"

      "label": "This app provides complete offline topographic map coverage of the South Island of New Zealand from the LINZ Topo50 1:50k scale map series.  The maps are all contained in the installation so there is no additional need for downloads, no need for phone or wifi signal, no slow server issues, no account signups, no missing tiles, and no additional map fees. Just install for seamless off-line zooming and panning across the whole island down to 1:50,000 scale. The app also includes 1:50k resolution satellite images for the island and elevation data.\n\nOther integrated data includes DOC open and restricted hunting permit boundaries, DOC huts, campgrounds, and tracks, Fish and Game access points, and Te Araroa trails. Other datasets can be imported.\n\nThe app has a full suite of navigation functions including GPS location, compass orientation, distance to map locations, track recording and graphing, route creation and following, import/export of gpx and kml files, search functions for named places and user data. Add and edit your own locations and routes and plot elevation profiles. Uses an intuitive simple interface, with one-touch access to all functions.\n\nLINZ TOPO250 series maps are used at lower zoom levels for easier navigation.\n\nPerfect for outback use out of cell phone range. GPS and maps function fully without phone coverage. No need to cache files in advance either as they are all fully installed with the app. Popular with trampers, hikers, runners, bikers, search and rescue (SAR), hunters, boaters, as well as survey applications.\n\nNote that continuous use of GPS will run down the battery faster than when not using the GPS. The NZTopo50 app gives you full control over when GPS is used. The map can be used without GPS, intermittently with GPS for spot checking of location, continuously for logging while the app is open, or for continuous background logging when the phone is off. \n\nCheck our website for links to user guides and useful tips and tricks.\n\nFeel free to get in touch with any suggestions."

The app uses your GPS location to track your boat on the map to keep you aware of what bridges and no wake zones are coming up on your route.  NOAA boating charts can also be used as the base map!\n\nThis is a must have for recreational boaters in Florida and snowbirds cruising south for the winter down the ICW.  Boating in FL can be frustrating due to no wake zones and limited bridge openings.  Limited bridge openings could mean waits of up to an hour or more.  This tool will help you to stay informed and plan accordingly.\n\nThe app covers all of the waterways in Florida, including the Intracoastal Waterway (ICW), bays, inlets and canals.  Also covers key areas such as the Okeechobee Waterway, New River, and more.  Includes information from a variety of sources, including NOAA charts, state and federal Manatee Protection Zones, Boating Safety Zones and more. It covers the ICW all the way up to Chesapeake Bay, and all coastal waters and rivers up through VA.\n\nTide station information was also added.   For each tide station, the times for high and low tides each day are shown.  Tidal heights are included as well.\n\nNOAA Coastal Waters Forecasts are now included.  These include wave height forecasts up to five days out.  NOAA Raster Nautical Charts can also be used as the background maps.\n\nSpeed and heading data are now included.

      "label": "Celestial navigation has never been easier!  With ezAlmanacOne and a sextant you will be finding your fix like a pro in no time!\n\nezAlmanacOne is an evolution of the iPad version of ezAlmanac with the modern user interface used in the Windows 10 version of ezAlmanac.  All of the features of ezAlmanac plus new features including:\n\n- Universal app runs on iPad, iPhone, iPod touch, and the new MacBook with M1 processor.\n- Supports all device orientations.  All screens support zoom and pan.\n- Make bearing observations to perform compass checks.\n- Archive saved observations and restore observation data from an archive.\n- Includes quick start guide, usage examples, and other documentation to learn celestial navigation.\n- Print/Output Nautical Almanac pages, observation reports, and other app documentation.\n\nezAlmanacOne will help you perform celestial navigation exactly as it has been done for hundreds of years. It produces all Nautical Almanac (1960-2059) and Pub. 229 tables exactly as you are used to seeing them in the printed form.  All tables can be accessed directly for manual usage if you choose to do so.  Since they are produced by the software they support zooming and panning, and you can highlight in the tables to easily find the correct value to use.\n\nMost users, however, will prefer to let ezAlmanacOne do all of the work.  Simply enter the basic sight parameters, make and enter your observations, and ezAlmanacOne will do the rest.  It performs all of the steps to correct your observation, find GP of the object, do the sight reduction, and plot the LOP.  No steps are skipped and all details are shown.  Click where the LOPs cross in the plot and you have found your fix!\n\nBesides finding your fix, ezAlmanacOne is one of the best tools available to perform compass checks from a bearing observation of one of the navigational bodies. The compass check function supports checking up to 5 devices from a single bearing observation.  ezAlmanacOne will also create a report of your compass check that can be saved as a PDF file or printed for the ships records.\n\nCelestial navigation instructors love ezAlmanacOne because it does celestial navigation exactly as they teach it.  Values obtained from the Nautical Almanac and Pub. 229 are clearly identified with an icon of the book.  When you press the book icon you are taken to the page that has that value with the row, column and value highlighted.  Even when ezAlmanacOne is doing all the work, it can teach you how to do it manually using the books.\n\nFor manual celestial navigation you can generate and print Nautical Almanac pages to use as a backup on a passage.  You can even print the sight reduction forms and plotting sheets you will need.\n\nezAlmanacOne performs all astronomical calculations using the NOVAS 3.1 software from the US Naval Observatory (USNO) and a JPL ephemeris that covers the years 1960 through 2059.  It also implements WMM-2020, the latest World Magnetic Model software available from NOAA, to compute magnetic declination.  Since all calculations are performed in the software, ezAlmanacOne is fully functional with no dependency on the internet."

Uses an intuitive simple interface, with one-touch access to all functions.\n\nLINZ TOPO250 series maps are used at lower zoom levels for easier navigation.\n\nPerfect for outback use out of cell phone range. GPS and maps function fully without phone coverage. No need to cache files in advance either as they are all fully installed with the app. Popular with trampers, hikers, runners, bikers, search and rescue (SAR), hunters, boaters, as well as survey applications.\n\nNote that continuous use of GPS will run down the battery faster than when not using the GPS. The NZTopo50 app gives you full control over when GPS is used. The map can be used without GPS, intermittently with GPS for spot checking of location, continuously for logging while the app is open, or for continuous background logging when the phone is off. \n\nCheck our website for links to user guides and useful tips and tricks.\n\nFeel free to get in touch with any suggestions."

Unlike simple tide clocks that you can buy in novelty stores, more accurate tide predictions use special data gathered by instruments located at each tide station. The data from these measurements are used to determine the harmonic components which then feed into the mathematical algorithms which predict tides for the future. The end results are tested for accuracy and adjustments are made as necessary.\n\nTide Graph has US owned Tide Stations Only.

Your phone got you to the zoo, now use it to show you around once you’re inside!\n\nGet instant directions to animals, restaurants, rides and attractions, bathrooms and water fountains. Our interactive map guides you to where you want to go. Don’t use those paper maps, they are not eco-friendly and they are difficult to read - \nOur mapping works even if you don't have a signal (web-based maps can't do that). \n \nZooMap is not affiliated with the Jacksonville Zoo, but we love zoos and what they do for the community. When our CEO saw people enter the zoo and rush to a poorly executed wall map or try to navigate using outdated paper maps that are wasteful and not very eco-friendly.  He knew we could help. Our goal is to increase your fun, while saving your time (and trees).\n \nTap on screen icons, use the search bar or open main menu to find animals, food, rides and attractions – even bathrooms and water fountains on those hot days. Soon, you will be able to receive notifications concerning feeding times, ride closures or any other up to the minute information you need to have the best time possible in the zoo. \n\nZooMap Features\n\nSAVE PARKING SPACE\n-\tUpon arrival you can save your parking location and BetterMaps will bring you right back to where you parked at the end of the day.\n\nGET TO KNOW THE ANIMALS\n-\tUse our menus to see pics, learn about the animals; then get mapped right to them.\n\nGET DIRECTIONS VIRTUALLY ANYWHERE IN THE ZOO\n-\tFind Animals, Exhibits, Rides, Restaurant and shopping, then click the MapMe walker icon. You will see how far and approximate time to walk there. Click Go and our live map will bring you to your destination. Veer off course and BetterMaps will adapt in real time. \n\nBE IN THE KNOW (ONLY IF ZOO PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION)\n-\tReceive notifications updating you on ride and animal closures\n-\tReceive discounts from surrounding businesses\n\nFOR BUSINESS OWNERS: MALLS, ZOOS, PARKS, MUNICIPALITIES, AMUSEMENT\nBetterMaps takes maps to a whole new level – the micro-level. We create maps for smaller spaces, such as zoos, amusement parks, cemeteries and even municipalities and outdoor malls. Use Google or Apple Maps to get you there, use BetterMaps to get around. check out our website: www.bettermaps.app"

It's like having a log book and data recorder in your pocket! Hot air is loaded with lots of different features; many based on pilot feedback from around the world.\n\n---------------------------\nMajor Features:\n---------------------------\n\n- Real-time tracking! Great for improving situationally awareness, see your current location on a map or satellite imagery\n\n- Waypoints to show your distance, bearing, and ETE to a target location\n\n- Offline maps available\n\n- Record your entire flight path (you can even turn your screen off during recording)! Then you can export your flight to your computer and view it in 3D using Google Earth\n\n- KML/KMZ overlays! Add custom overlay data to the real-time flight maps (can be used to map out electric lines, friendly or unfriendly places to land, denoting special airspaces, include information such as radio frequencies or phone numbers, etc.).\n\n- Wind data tracking - records wind speed and direction at the various altitudes as you fly\n\n- Integration of the Glympse location sharing service to allow ground crew, family, or others to track your flight in real-time. They can track you using almost any device with a data connection. \n\n- Flight Log- the log makes it easy to track information common to all pilots such as crew members, passengers, maximum envelope temperature, and propane used. The log also makes saving takeoff and landing locations convenient, thanks to the iPhone’s GPS or triangulation capabilities; plus, it has a \"favorites\" list for takeoff locations.

Touch again to view it.\n\n* Search by name for over a million towns, peaks, lakes, parks and other features.\n\n* No network connection is needed once the maps have been installed.\n\n* Mark waypoints, and import and export waypoint files in GPX, KML and CSV formats.\n\n* Touch the \"current location\" button to see where you are, and the compass button to align the map with the ground.\n\n* See coordinates in NAD27 or WGS84 degrees, degrees minutes and seconds, UTM, or MGRS formats.\n\n* Measure distances (miles, feet and km) and bearings (true and magnetic).\n\nThe Maps: This app uses high-quality scans of the traditional USGS and NRCan topographic maps which have been the definitive resource for hikers and other backcountry users for many years.  You can make the terrain stand out with hill shading, using simulated sunlight from the direction of your choice.  In the U.S., this app does not use the new \"US Topo\" maps because they do not show hiking trails and lack other details: please see the web site for more details.\n\nDownloading: US maps are around 8 MB in size and download in a few seconds on a typical home broadband connection.  Canadian maps are larger.  Both cellular data and WiFi can be used, though WiFi is likely to be more reliable in most cases.\n\n- Do please visit http://topomapsapp.com/ for complete instructions, so that you don't miss any features.\n\nWe have many ideas for additional features to add to future versions of this app; if you have ideas or other questions or comments, contact details can be found on the website, http://topomapsapp.com/. The website also has more screenshots and other information."

      "label": "Welcome to the BetterMaps ZooMap app, Bronx Zoo version. Our custom interactive map plans the shortest route to your destination. Our mapping works even if you don't have a signal (web-based maps can't do that). Find animals, rides & attractions, food and more and our map will guide you to your destination. Get food (or a beer) and find the bathrooms when you're done (quickly!) Walk around knowing you don't have to remember where you parked (we do that for you - then bring you back to the car at the end of a long day). So have fun and get mapped. Free! - other zoos coming soon. \n \nZooMap is not affiliated with the Bronx Zoo but we are a New York company (located in Brooklyn), and we LOVE the Bronx Zoo. When our CEO saw people enter the zoo and rush to a poorly executed wall map or try to navigate using an outdated paper map (uh, save the planet much?) he knew we could help. Our goal is to increase your fun, while saving your time (and trees).\n\nThe BetterMaps ZooMap, Bronx Zoo version truly is the best way to explore the Bronx Zoo (more zoos are coming online very soon) without missing anything that you and/or the family want to see during your visit. The ZooMap digital guide brings you a whole new level of closeness to everything the Bronx Zoo has to offer. Once you have found what you are looking for, our custom algorithm shows you route overview, how away you are, and approximate time to walk there. Simply hit Go and just follow the blue line to get there. Our flashlight points you in the right direction (use your phone as a wayfinder). Veer off the path, no problem, our map adapts to your movements and reroutes instantly.  \n\nTap onscreen icons, use the search bar or drop down menu to find animals, food, rides and attractions – even bathrooms and water fountains on those hot days. Soon you will be able to receive notifications concerning feeding times, ride closures or any other up to the minute information you need to have the best time possible in the zoo.  \n\nZooMap Features\n\nSAVE PARKING SPACE\n-\tUpon arrival you can save your parking location and BetterMaps will bring you right back to where you parked at the end of the day – no more having to use your door lock fob to find your car beeping in the distance.\n\nGET TO KNOW THE ANIMALS\n-\tUse our menus to learn about the animals, species and where they are from.\n\nGET DIRECTIONS VIRTUALLY ANYWHERE IN THE ZOO\n-\tFind Animals, Exhibits, Rides, Restaurant and shopping, then click the MapMe walker icon. You will see how far and approximate time to walk there. Click Go and our live map will bring you to your destination. Veer off course and BetterMaps will adapt in real time. \n\nBE IN THE KNOW\n-\tReceive notifications updating you on ride and animal closures\n-\tReceive discounts from surrounding businesses\n\nFOR BUSINESS OWNERS: MALLS, ZOOS, PARKS, MUNICIPALITIES, AMUSEMENT\nBetterMaps takes maps to a whole new level – the micro-level. We create maps for smaller spaces, such as zoos, amusement parks, cemeteries and even municipalities and outdoor malls. Use Google or Apple Maps to get you there, use BetterMaps to get around. check out our website: www.bettermaps.app\n\nBut we do more than just help you visitors navigate, we provide communications as well – send out the latest news and updates, tell your visitors what’s going on before they arrive.\n\nGet information into the hands of your customers: food and drink specials, shopping deals, popup sales and other updates to make their day more rewarding and keep them coming back."

An E6B is also used to calculate data used for performance planning such as density altitude.

      "label": "“Awesome!!! The best speed app on iphone” 5 Stars by kurtonic\n\nSpeed Box is a Speedometer and GPS app for both your iPhone and iPad. It displays your current speed, distance, direction and altitude along with your top speed and average speed. The app also keeps a record of the speed and altitude for the last few hours.\n\n\nMAIN FEATURES\n========================\n\n* MPH, KM/H and KNOTS\n* Show decimal speed (e.g. \"45.7 mph\")\n* One app for both the iPhone and iPad\n* \"Speak speed\" - Tap screen to have the speed spoken to you\n* 11 Analog and digital speedometers\n* Map view\n* Maximum and average speed\n* Altitude \n* Digital compass \n* HUD display to see speed in windshield \n* Odometer to measure distance traveled \n* Chart of the traveled speed and altitude \n* Warning signal when driving too fast \n* Export last 3 hours of data \n* Change maximum displayed speed on speedometer \n* Swipe finger over chart to display historic data \n* Display GPS accuracy by tapping the indicator in the top left corner \n\n\nUSER REVIEWS\n========================\n\n5 Stars by Darekakuta \n\"Just what I needed. My '58 chev's speedo doesn't work. This did the trick.\" \n\n5 Stars by Rawd \n\"Great My 79 Firebird speedo only goes to 140 kmh. ;). This worked perfectly.\" \n\n5 Stars \n\"Within 1 mile per hour +/- Great Job!\" \n\nSpeedBox was one of the very early Speedometer Apps for the iPhone. Take advantage of my experience and the refined algorithms that can get a much greater accuracy from the iPhone then a lot of other apps. I regularly update my application to make it even more accurate and usable. \n\nUsers have already used our application to verify the accuracy of their car's speedometer or they tried measuring the speed they achieved while skiing. Can you come up with more ideas? How about measuring the speed of the airplane you travel with? \n\nUSAGE NOTES\n========================\nThe \"GPS strength\" indicator in the top left corner should display a green dot. You can tap this indicator to display the current GPS accuracy.\n\nPlease allow the application up to a minute to find enough satellites to work correctly. \n\nIf you get a message to enable GSP, please go to ”Settings > General > Location Services“ on your iPhone and check if the little switch is set to \"On\" for Speed Box as well as for \"Location Services\" in general. \n\nATTENTION iPod touch users! Unfortunately this app doesn't work very well on the iPod touch and the iPad WiFI (without 3G) since these devices are missing a GPS!\n\n\nFEEDBACK\n========================\nIf you've got any wishes or suggestions for new features, please let me know with the contact form on this application's website (see link below).\n\nI am already working on the next update!"

Many other uses for engine tuning, racing, sports, etc.\n\n* Seamlessly integrates weather data, GPS and your phone's onboard barometer to quickly and accurately calculate your density altitude, altimeter setting, relative air density, and more.\n\n* Takes humidity into account in all calculations, making it more accurate than the typical dry bulb approximation formula used by AWOS/ASOS, etc.\n\n* Works anywhere. Great without cellular connection as well, which makes it all the more useful in the backcountry and far away from ASOS/AWOS stations.\n\n* Location Search: Find atmospheric data (Density Altitude, etc.) at any point on Earth, from anywhere!\n\nData Sensed and Calculated (all calculated with humidity):\n\n* Density Altitude \n* GPS Altitude\n* Temperature\n* Altimeter Setting\n* Absolute Pressure\n* Dew Point\n* Relative Humidity\n* Specific Humidity (grains/pound)\n* Air Density\n* Relative Air Density (RAD)\n* Dyno Correction\n\nThe quickest way to get your Density Altitude! On the iPhone 6/6+ and newer iPads, it will use the built-in barometer and GPS. If you're in cell range, you don't need to supply any data. If you're out of cell range, all you need to supply is the outside air temperature. Designed not to need an internet connection, so it will work anytime and anywhere you need it.\n\nGreat tool for pilots, drag racers, engine tuners, golfers, or anyone who needs to conveniently find their Density Altitude, Altimeter Setting, Relative Aid Density (RAD), Specific Humidity or Absolute Pressure.\n\nNo ads or in-app purchases.\n\nWe love feedback!

      "label": "Pro Altimeter for Watch is the newest Watch app from Hunter Research, developer of the popular outdoors app Theodolite.  Pro Altimeter uses the high-fidelity barometric pressure sensor in the Apple Watch to measure and compute altitude.  Although this is a Watch app, it has the same features, capabilities, and accuracy as the Pro Altimeter app for iPhone and iPad, just in a smaller form factor on your wrist!\n\nPro Altimeter has a dead simple interface.  Barometric altitude and GPS altitude are displayed in large easy to read numbers, with available units of feet or meters, and realtime accuracy estimates from the hardware.  At bottom are calibration and settings buttons. The display offers highly-readable color schemes of luminescent green on black, white on black, and midnight red on black.\n\nProper calibration is necessary to measure altitude from barometric pressure (this is why a pilot \"dials in\" the cockpit altimeter before taking off). Pro Altimeter offers numerous methods for calibration -- choose the easiest and most convenient:\n\n1. Use GPS altitude.  This method correlates the measured local barometric pressure with the altitude measured by GPS. This method can be used when your device has a clear line of sight to the sky and a reliable GPS fix with good accuracy that you trust.\n\n2. Manually enter altitude in feet or meters.  This method correlates the measured local barometric pressure with known altitude from landmarks, elevation benchmarks, trail markers, topo maps, land surveys, etc.\n\n3. Manually enter pressure.  If you have a weather station, weather report, or METAR report with equivalent sea level pressure for a nearby location, this can be used to correlate local barometric pressure to altitude.  Pressure can be entered with units of inches Hg, kPa, or mb. \n\n4. Check local airports.  With the tap of a button, Pro Altimeter will locate the five closest airports within 100 miles (160km) of your present location anywhere in the world, and pull in METAR data.  From that list of five, pick the airport of your choice and Pro Altimeter will import pressure data for calibration.\n\nOnce calibrated, Pro Altimeter keeps track of the time since its last calibration.  Because weather and local barometric pressure change over time, the app will warn you when 6 hours have elapsed since the last calibration by flashing the \"CAL\" button.  You should calibrate as frequently as practical -- for example, on a hike, calibrate whenever you pass a trail marker or elevation benchmark, or hourly.  But at a minimum, calibrate at least every 6 hours or whenever weather changes in your area.\n\nPro Altimeter runs on all Apple Watch models running watchOS 8.3 or later."

      "label": "The first and only Vector Magnetometer on the iPhone - Visualize the hidden world of magnetism around you in 3 dimensions (3GS or later!)! It can be perfectly used to explore and measure the direction and strength of the magnetic field of random objects around you (which can be quite fascinating!). With limitations (see docs) it can be used as a metal detector to find electric lines or pipes in walls (always good to check a wall before drilling in, at least better with this than not to check at all). Another application is to use this tool as a rough estimate of your north-south position on earth without using the GPS(!) - just by measuring the local earth magnetic declination (it works fine even while flying in a plane to check how the declination changes). Or simply explore your next Christmas present before opening it! Send us your results!\n\n\nThe application has four different displays modes to visualize the magnetic field:\n\n- Absolute Mode: Displays the absolute magnetic field in microtesla (μT) measured by the magnetometer.\n\n- North Mode: A compass head-up displays the geographic north along with the pointer that directs to the magnetic north (thus display difference magnetic to geographic north).\n\n- Declination Mode: Two arrows will be displayed to indicate the declination of the earth magnetic field (0° just on equator, increasing to north with blue pointer direction up or south with blue pointer direction down). \n\n- Relative Mode: This mode shows the relative strength (absolute minus compensation vector) of the magnetic field in μT. \n\n\n… and five different display modes for acceleration visualization: \n\n- Absolute Mode: Displays the reverse acceleration of the iPhone (1g up when hold steady). \n\n- X-Rotation - Y-Rotation - Z-Rotation: The arrow will display the rotation around the X-, Y- and Z-Axis of the iPhone. The digital indicator shows the angle numerically (-180° - +180°). A way to calibrate will be added with one of the next updates, so you could use this as a level.\n\n- Relative Mode: This mode shows the relative strength (absolute minus compensation vector) of the acceleration.\n\n\nFor a detailed documentation, please visit our product homepage. \n\n\nFor recreational use only. However it CAN (!) be very accurate. The measurement is performed as good as possible (we try our best) by using the inbuilt accelerometer and magnetometer to their limits. The range of the accelerometer typically has a max of ±3g (~4.2g displayed here if combined) and each magnetometer usually recalibrates internally when over ±120μT in one axis. However, tell us your experience!"

A portion of the proceeds go to NYSSA to promote snowmobiling and other snowmobile club projects in New York State.\r\n\r\nThe NYSSA mobile app brings current snowmobile trail information and points of interest into live online and OFFLINE map capabilities. This is far from a static map as NYSSA’s 200+ clubs have LIVE access to update trail status as well as add warnings, reroutes and points of interest through their administrative access. Clubs also have access to add their own local trails, with new trails being added and updated regularly.\r\n\r\nSome of the highlights of the app:\r\n\r\n-Choose between both online (live updates) and OFFLINE maps. Offline maps updates are available daily.\r\n-See your current location and heading, allowing the app to follow your location.\r\n-Breadcrumb tracking of current location and new navigation mode.\r\n-View current trail status (open, closed, unreported), closures, and reroutes\r\n-Find fuel, food, lodging, parking and ride locations, parts and service, and scenic or points of interest recommended by NYSSA and clubs.\r\n-Click on trails or points of interest to see more information\r\n-Measure distances and areas\r\n-Choose between multiple basemaps including imagery\r\n-Search for locations and address\r\n-Toggle layers on and off\r\nPlease contact us (email link within the app) with suggestions for future updates. We look forward to working with the snowmobile community in our future development efforts!\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n*Trail status, reroutes, and related points are maintained by the clubs and may not always be accurate.\r\n**Continued use of GPS will quickly drain battery life. It is recommended to turn off GPS when not required or plug into a power source during extended use.\r\n***This purchase is for the 2022-2023 season. The app will continue to work through October 2023, and will time out on November 1st, 2023. Another purchase is required for the 2023-2024 season***"

      "label": "Welcome to the BetterMaps ZooMap app, Cincinnati Zoo version. \n\nSimple, fast and fun. Our app makes everyone’s day at the zoo better. Your phone got you to the zoo, now use it to show you around once you’re inside!\n\nGet instant directions to animals, restaurants, rides and attractions, bathrooms and water fountains. Our interactive map guides you to where you want to go. Don’t use those paper maps, they are not eco-friendly and they are difficult to read - \nOur mapping works even if you don't have a signal (web-based maps can't do that). \n \nZooMap is not affiliated with the Cincinnati Zoo, but we love zoos and what they do for the community. When our CEO saw people enter the zoo and rush to a poorly executed wall map or try to navigate using outdated paper maps that are wasteful and not very eco-friendly.  He knew we could help. Our goal is to increase your fun, while saving your time (and trees).\n \nTap on screen icons, use the search bar or open main menu to find animals, food, rides and attractions – even bathrooms and water fountains on those hot days. Soon, you will be able to receive notifications concerning feeding times, ride closures or any other up to the minute information you need to have the best time possible in the zoo. \n\nZooMap Features\n\nSAVE PARKING SPACE\n-\tUpon arrival you can save your parking location and BetterMaps will bring you right back to where you parked at the end of the day.\n\nGET TO KNOW THE ANIMALS\n-\tUse our menus to see pics, learn about the animals; then get mapped right to them.\n\nGET DIRECTIONS VIRTUALLY ANYWHERE IN THE ZOO\n-\tFind Animals, Exhibits, Rides, Restaurant and shopping, then click the MapMe walker icon. You will see how far and approximate time to walk there. Click Go and our live map will bring you to your destination. Veer off course and BetterMaps will adapt in real time. \n\nBE IN THE KNOW (ONLY IF ZOO PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION)\n-\tReceive notifications updating you on ride and animal closures\n-\tReceive discounts from surrounding businesses\n\nFOR BUSINESS OWNERS: MALLS, ZOOS, PARKS, MUNICIPALITIES, AMUSEMENT\nBetterMaps takes maps to a whole new level – the micro-level. We create maps for smaller spaces, such as zoos, amusement parks, cemeteries and even municipalities and outdoor malls. Use Google or Apple Maps to get you there, use BetterMaps to get around. check out our website: www.bettermaps.app"

      "label": "Theodolite is a multi-function viewfinder that combines a compass, two-axis inclinometer, rangefinder, GPS, map, nav calculator, and geo-overlay photo/movie camera into one indispensable app. Theodolite was one of the very first augmented reality (AR) apps when it was released in 2009, and it’s been downloaded and used by millions of customers since then. Uses are endless, and the app is great for land measurements, outdoor sports, sightseeing, navigation, and finding your way around. Theodolite is a pro grade app and is used extensively by surveyors, geologists, architects, engineers, competitive sportsmen, first responders, military personnel, and search and rescue workers around the world. \n\nTheodolite lets you take data-overlay photos and movies with 2X-8X zoom. Overlay geographical data, angle markings, date/time, author/company info, and project notes directly on photos and movies for later reference. The same data is written into the metadata record of images, making image files self-contained data records. Third-party apps can tap into Theodolite's advanced camera functions with a camera sharing feature.\n\nView current position on the built-in map with optional offline Outdoors maps that include topo contours, roads, trails, landmarks, campgrounds, ski lifts, and more. Live map markers continually update distance/heading relative to the current location and also show wayfinding info in the main viewfinder. Draw polygons on the map to mark things like property boundaries and trails, and import/export polygon data via KML.\n\nShare map markers and nav calculator points with other users of Theodolite via text messages or e-mail. This powerful capability opens up a wide range of collaborative uses including team land surveying, accident investigations, spotting wild fires, triangulation of landmarks, and advanced tactical observation and targeting.

As with the other platforms, the iOS map includes an index to more than 1,000 backcountry locations in Utah’s Central Wasatch mountains. It is the must-have app for Utah hikers and backcountry travelers. \n\nWith a familiar map-app interface, the Wasatch Backcountry Skiing Map accesses your device’s GPS to display your current location on a high-resolution topo map. And with only a few taps, the “destination arrow” on the integrated compass will point to your desired backcountry ski location.\n\nAnd with a single tap, hundreds of the locations will open the Wasatch Backcountry Skiing Guide website where you can view photographs and detailed information about the location.\n\nThe app also displays your current elevation and lat/long, and will send your current location via email. And with a tap, you can display detailed information on more than 200 of the locations including skiing difficulty, skinning distance, vertical climb, parking considerations, and more.\n\n(Contrary to a posted review, you don't need cell service to use this app--you don't even need a contract with a cell service provider.)\n\nNOTICES: When navigating, the “destination arrow” points directly to the destination without regard to hazards such as avalanche paths, cliffs, and rock fall. It is your responsibility to travel in the backcountry safely."

What's the cost of my driving?\nBased on gas price for a gallon or litre, MPG (U.S. or UK) or liters per 100 km the app will tell you what the cost is as you drive. You can add an extra cost per kilometer or mile! Useful for all cost aware drivers and for splitting the cost between passengers.\n\n‣‣ GPS TRACKING. Where I've been? How long did it take to get from A to B? \nSpeedometer records your trip statistics even when GPS tracker is switched off. When you need point by point data to see on the map later or export (Google Earth and GPX), speedometer gives you the first class GPS tracker.\n\n‣‣ INFOTAINMENT. \nWhen switched on, infotainment shows trip stats or weather/wind forecast  when you wait. Way better than just showing you a 0 speed!\n\n‣‣ Easy to set speed limits and SPEED LIMIT MEMORY option\nSet speed limits with 4 or 8 fast and configurable presets. Presets only need a single tap and are the safest way to set the limits! With SPEED LIMIT MEMORY you just apply the speed limit once and the app applies it for you automatically the next time!\n\n‣‣ MODES\nUse MENU>MODES to turn the app into a Rally computer, G-Force monitor, Camera alerter or taximeter! Currently there are 12 modes available and we are constantly adding new ones.\n\n‣‣ WAYPOINTS.\nSpeedometer gives you the unique way to leave a note with location and even optional photo or audio note attached! As easy as double tap on the big speed digits! You'll find more in a documentation section (star button).\n\n‣‣ RED LIGHT & SPEED CAMERAS\nImport camera data into speedometer in Garmin or iGO csv formats from poi-factory.com, scdb.info or poi-plaza and let speedo alert you on a camera approach and set speed limit automatically before you pass the speed camera!\n\n‣‣ SUNSET/SUNRISE\nWith the sunset and sunrise information that our speedometer provides, you'll be able to avoid driving in the dusk.\n\n‣‣ BARO VSI. Barometric Vertical Speed Indicator (VSI, IVSI) in both scale and graph forms.\n\n‣‣ VOICE COACH. When enabled and configured, voice coach will be telling you active track distance and duration as well as current speed and altitude.\n\n‣‣ MAPS. Google's native, Apple map, Blank map and Offline maps.\n\n‣‣ Siri shortcuts: New Track, Stop Track, Speed limits.\n\n+ UNIVERSAL APP. Speedometer for iPhone and cellular iPads. All in retina graphics.\n\n+ 000-999 SPEED AND LIMIT RANGE. MPH, KM/H AND KNOTS. Maximum/TOP, average speed, distance traveled.\n\n+ BACKGROUND MODE! Speedometer will work in background if told so and will still warn you with audio alert when exceed a preset speed limit. You can use other apps while speedometer does its job in the background!\n\n+ PRIVACY. Speedometer never shares your location data with 3rd parties or ad agencies. Location data is used solely for tracking your speed and recording the GPS tracks and never leave the app unless you decide to share by means of a track export. It always let you know when background mode is on and never runs in background unless it is explicitly told to do so.\n\n! You can use this app on your iPhone as well as on any cellular iPad. **App will not work properly on iPods and wifi only iPads as they don't have GPS (external GPS module is required). \n!

      "label": "Theodolite was one of the earliest augmented reality (AR) apps for iOS when it debuted in 2009 -- in fact Theodolite was pioneering AR technology before \"AR\" was even a buzzword! In the time since, Theodolite has been used by millions of consumers and professionals in their outdoor adventures and on the job. Now, we've taken the Theodolite concept to Apple Watch by combining a compass, inclinometer, GPS, and maps into one indispensable app that sits on your wrist. We're excited to keep evolving this centuries-old instrument as hardware and software technologies allow the concept to come to new device formats.\n\nOn iPhone and iPad, Theodolite uses a viewfinder format, uniting the device sensors (GPS, magnetometer, gyro, accelerometer) and camera.  On Apple Watch, Theodolite combines data from these sensors into an AHRS (attitude and heading reference system) layout similar to what you'd see in the glass cockpit of a modern aircraft. This layout allows Theodolite to efficiently display compass bearing (yaw angle), pitch angle, and roll angle in a compact format that works extremely well on a small screen.  This information is augmented by latitude, longitude, and altitude from GPS, as well as sun and moon position.\n\nNew in Theodolite for Watch version 2 is a map screen and waypoint manager.  You can add waypoints on the map or at your current location, and view waypoints on the compass ring to visualize their bearing from your current location.\n\nTheodolite has settings for compass mode (true or magnetic), distance/altitude units (feet or meters), and position format (decimal degrees, degrees-minutes-seconds, MGRS, USNG, UTM, UTM-B, and Maidenhead Locator System).  Users can choose to display an artificial horizon in the center of the app display (tied to pitch and roll) and can set the app's level reference to flat or vertical orientations of the Watch.  The app has six color schemes, including two night vision modes - midnight red and luminescent green.\n\nTheodolite for Watch is recommended for Apple Watch Series 5 and later (including Ultra).  Apple Watch Series 4 and older do not have a compass sensor and will not show compass data.  On older devices, the app uses the device's gyro sensor to measure rotation.  You can twist the watch's digital crown to adjust and calibrate the gyro to the sun position, moon position, or a known bearing.  Using these references, the \"gyro compass\" is able to give bearing.  The calibration can be repeated as often as desired to give accurate results.\n\nTheodolite reports accuracy from the magnetometer sensor in your Watch.  To improve results, operate Theodolite away from magnets, electronics, or sources of electro-magnetic interference, including car dashboards, aircraft cockpits, metal structures, and other devices.\n\nLike all our apps, we plan to continually improve and evolve Theodolite for Watch.  Please contact us with feature requests, suggestions, and general feedback.  We'd love to hear what you're doing with the app!  And if you don't already have Theodolite for your iPhone or iPad, check it out!"

      "label": "Welcome to the BetterMaps ZooMap app, Bronx Zoo version. Our custom interactive map plans the shortest route to your destination. Our mapping works even if you don't have a signal (web-based maps can't do that). Find animals, rides & attractions, food and more and our map will guide you to your destination. Get food (or a beer) and find the bathrooms when you're done (quickly!) Walk around knowing you don't have to remember where you parked (we do that for you - then bring you back to the car at the end of a long day). So have fun and get mapped. Free! - other zoos coming soon. \n \nZooMap is not affiliated with the Bronx Zoo but we are a New York company (located in Brooklyn), and we LOVE the Bronx Zoo. When our CEO saw people enter the zoo and rush to a poorly executed wall map or try to navigate using an outdated paper map (uh, save the planet much?) he knew we could help. Our goal is to increase your fun, while saving your time (and trees).\n\nThe BetterMaps ZooMap, Bronx Zoo version truly is the best way to explore the Bronx Zoo (more zoos are coming online very soon) without missing anything that you and/or the family want to see during your visit. The ZooMap digital guide brings you a whole new level of closeness to everything the Bronx Zoo has to offer. Once you have found what you are looking for, our custom algorithm shows you route overview, how away you are, and approximate time to walk there. Simply hit Go and just follow the blue line to get there. Our flashlight points you in the right direction (use your phone as a wayfinder). Veer off the path, no problem, our map adapts to your movements and reroutes instantly.  \n\nTap onscreen icons, use the search bar or drop down menu to find animals, food, rides and attractions – even bathrooms and water fountains on those hot days. Soon you will be able to receive notifications concerning feeding times, ride closures or any other up to the minute information you need to have the best time possible in the zoo.  \n\nZooMap Features\n\nSAVE PARKING SPACE\n-\tUpon arrival you can save your parking location and BetterMaps will bring you right back to where you parked at the end of the day – no more having to use your door lock fob to find your car beeping in the distance.\n\nGET TO KNOW THE ANIMALS\n-\tUse our menus to learn about the animals, species and where they are from.\n\nGET DIRECTIONS VIRTUALLY ANYWHERE IN THE ZOO\n-\tFind Animals, Exhibits, Rides, Restaurant and shopping, then click the MapMe walker icon. You will see how far and approximate time to walk there. Click Go and our live map will bring you to your destination. Veer off course and BetterMaps will adapt in real time. \n\nBE IN THE KNOW\n-\tReceive notifications updating you on ride and animal closures\n-\tReceive discounts from surrounding businesses\n\nFOR BUSINESS OWNERS: MALLS, ZOOS, PARKS, MUNICIPALITIES, AMUSEMENT\nBetterMaps takes maps to a whole new level – the micro-level. We create maps for smaller spaces, such as zoos, amusement parks, cemeteries and even municipalities and outdoor malls. Use Google or Apple Maps to get you there, use BetterMaps to get around. check out our website: www.bettermaps.app\n\nBut we do more than just help you visitors navigate, we provide communications as well – send out the latest news and updates, tell your visitors what’s going on before they arrive.\n\nGet information into the hands of your customers: food and drink specials, shopping deals, popup sales and other updates to make their day more rewarding and keep them coming back."

You may already know some of the iconic landmarks and wildernesses that the US has to offer, but did you know that there are millions of acres of public Bureau of Land Management property in the Western US? This app is your guide to discovering the unspeakable beauty and recreational potential that is contained within these fabled domains!\n\nWhether you are a seasoned forest wanderer or are just wanting to learn a little more about the amazing places surrounding your home turf, this app is for you! The data is up to date as of Summer, 2022, and contains over 53,000 recreational points and other features on BLM land. These points are symbolized with several color-coded icons that differentiate between the . Categories include Access Points, Boating, Campgrounds, POIs, Vistas, Bathrooms, Parking Lots, Recreational Areas, and much more! The app even distinguishes property boundaries and includes some hiking trails and roads.\n\nNew in this release! We listened to your requests and have added several improvements and new features including a custom My Points tool! Now you can save your own points of interest and give them a unique color and icon. Mark where you park the car, where you saw a neat feature, or an epic campsite. You can even export these points for use with other devices!\n\nOnce using the app, there are five screens. The Guide screen will provide data legends as well as helpful tips for optimizing your navigational experience. On the Info screen, you will find a number of spatial links to the different BLM properties. This is a great way to quickly locate specific places and discover new places to explore! The About screen provides links to all of the open-source resources used in the app and gives a little information about the developer GeoPOI. The Map Settings screen is where you can change between one of four different basemaps, download offline imagery, turn on geolocation, and toggle specific point categories. Finally, the Map screen is where it all comes together!\n\nOn the Map screen, there are a series of circle clusters at distant zooms that indicate how many points are within a given cluster. As you tap the clusters to zoom in, individual points and icons become visible, along with trails, roads, and boundaries.

      "label": "This app puts the Mayan Dreamspell Calendar in your pocket! \"13:20:Sync makes it so much easier to understand and integrate the calendar into every day life. Highly recommend it.\" \n\nThe Mayan People have described, in breathtaking precision, the cycles of both the universe and nature around us. They created a harmonic calendar that is synchronized to all those cycles. Following these cycles can help you get a stronger connection with nature around you and become conscious of your essence.\n\nThis app provides a simple way to sync along those cycles, to raise our frequency and give us a new lens to view both our day-to-day and planetary events.\n\n- Did you ever realize that our (Gregorian) calendar is not a harmonic calendar? \n- Did you know that the moon has 13 (not 12!) orbits around the earth in 1 year? \n- Why do we live with this irregular calendar?\n- Are you interested in Astrology?\n\n-> All this, and more, is explained carefully in this app. (over 15.000 words on 37 pages) Please note that these text are in English language only.\n\nIn the New Time, synchronicity is the norm.\n\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// \n5 star rating across the world! \n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// \n\"Entertaining as well as enlightening\" \n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// \n\nMORE INFO: \nwww.1320sync.com \n\n\nFor the beginner this app is a learning tool because it contains an extensive explanation about Tones and Seals and the synchronizing order of the Mayan Astrology. You may think it's difficult at first but soon you will feel how it all connects. \n\n\"This app is great, and allows easy manipulation of dates. I spent years in books doing in hours what I can now do in seconds.\"\n\nFor the ones who are already familiar with the Mayan Calendar this app is a handy tool to navigate the cycles, and calculate the Combined Kin for any given combination. Furthermore this app can be of great assistance to teach other people about the 13:20 cycles and is used in teachings around the world.\n\n\n=== FEATURES ===\n\n+ Kin Calendar\nThis is your main Mayan Dreamspell Calendar Dashboard with all the details you need to stay in sync. Shows the Kin of today by default, and you can calculate the Kin for any other date.\n\n+ Personal Notes\nOn this new page you can keep your personal notes for the 2 main cycles of time: the Tzolkin cycle of 260 days and the 13 Moon cycle of 365 days. And with the powerful text search function you quickly find your notes.\n\n+ Kin Picker\nSelect any combination of the 13 Tones and 20 Seals. Top section can scroll to 4 pages with information.\n\n+ Combined Kin Calculator \nCalculate the Combined Kin of any combination of Kin.

Trail Treker works with clubs, tourism agencies and municipalities to make their maps work offline on end user smartphones. Once the map is loaded, you no longer need phone service; the GPS receiver in your phone will operate without phone service. In fact, we recommend that you place your phone in Airplane Mode if you are in an area with limited or partial phone service to conserve your battery.\nTrail Treker will also electronically, via GPS location, show local businesses and points of interest. You can store your own points of interest as well. Key points such as survival shelters, supplies, or emergency evacuation points may be shown on various maps.\n\nThe Trail Treker app will allow you to download any member map. If you have a member map code, the map will be free. If not, the map will be an additional purchase.\n\nContinued use of GPS in the background can decrease battery life.\n\nFEATURES:\nShow Trail map overlaid on various Google maps (Standard Street, Terrain, Satellite)\nShow your position on top of any map.\nRecord your position and tracks\nRecord notes regarding position points\nShare your saved positions or tracks with others\nSee local businesses on or near mapping area\nFilter local businesses by category\nLoad and layer up to two maps concurrently and any number of tracks.\nLoad any number of maps (storage space required)"

Ideally, your phone should have 16 GB of total internal memory in order to use BringGo as well as other apps and services on your phone.\n\nWhen you purchase the BringGo app, you will be downloading all the map data for the United States and Canada directly to your compatible smartphone.  If you wish to reduce the amount of memory required, you may elect to individually download maps for the States/Provinces relevant to you.  Unnecessary maps may be removed at a later date or additional maps may be downloaded as required through the map manager on the app.\n______________\nCOMPATIBLE VEHICLES\nThe BringGo app is compatible with 2013 or later Chevrolet Spark, 2013 or later Chevrolet Sonic, and Chevrolet Trax (Canada only) vehicles equipped with the available MyLink radio.  When your compatible smartphone is paired to a properly equipped compatible vehicle, the BringGo navigation screen will display on a color screen that is part of the vehicle's MyLink radio.  If you purchased a compatible vehicle before this functionality is available, your vehicle will require a no-charge MyLink radio software update at your Chevrolet dealer to support in-vehicle use of the BringGo app. For more details about this exciting vehicle app integration or launch timing, please contact your dealer or call 1-855-4- Support. \n______________\nPREMIUM NAVIGATION FEATURES \n• Turn-by-turn voice directions \n• Find Places: millions of onboard POIs\n• Stunning 3D landmarks \n• Lane Guidance to show you the correct lane to be in \n• Realistic Signpost Display \n• Map data from NAVTEQ onboard\n• Text-To-Speech voice guidance  (speaks street names)\n• Auto re-routing \n• Multiple routing options; faster time, shorter distance, ECO\n• Search by Address, Point on Map, ZIP and more \n• POI Search\n• Save and edit favorites \n• Recent destinations \n• Auto zooming (at intersection & on speed) \n• Route Planning\n• Route summary for trip information \n• Speed Limit warning \n• Current Location information\n\n______________\nMAP COVERAGE\nUnited States, Canada, Puerto Rico, and Hawaii. \n______________\nIN-APP PURCHASES\n1.

      "label": "Featured by Apple in “Best New Apps”!\n\nPlan your next trip. Mark places you want to go. Remember your favorite spots. Across town or across the world, you’ll never forget another place with Pinbox!\n\nAdd pins where you are, where you’ve been, or where you want to go. Pinbox makes it easy to quickly record and organize your important places into distinct maps for every activity, occasion, or geographic region.\n\nUnlike other apps, Pinbox doesn’t force you to save all your places on a single map. You can make one map for your favorite local restaurants - make another map for your next business trip or vacation - and make another map for errands you need to run this weekend. The possibilities are endless!\n\nPinbox is about you and your places. It’s not a social network. You don’t have to create an account or enter your Facebook details to use the app. Your maps aren’t cluttered with random places bookmarked by strangers. Pinbox is simply the best app for privately bookmarking places that are important to YOU!\n\nFEATURES\n\n• Simple, easy-to-use interface\n• Drop a pin for each place you want to remember\n• Add photos, notes, and other details to each pin\n• Choose from seven different pin colors\n• Organize your pins into separate maps\n• See your location in relation to your pins\n• Send maps to other Pinbox users\n• Send pins to Apple Maps, Google Maps, Waze, or Transit for directions\n• Save up to 2,500 pins\n• Display maps in Standard, Hybrid, or Satellite\n\nEXAMPLES OF MAPS YOU MIGHT CREATE\n\n• Travel planning\n• Favorite restaurants or restaurants to try\n• Customer locations / sales calls\n• Friends and family locations\n• Real Estate listings\n• Favorite hiking / biking trails\n• Secret fishing spots\n• Dog-friendly places\n• Parking spots\n• Favorite stores\n• Multi-stop errands\n• Potential photoshoot locations\n• The list goes on and on and on…\n\n\nStill not convinced? Here’s a few of our favorite reviews…\n\n\n“Pinbox is one of those simple apps that does one thing so well it feels frictionless”.\n-- Stephen Grassie\n\n\n“The interface is gorgeous - I would say that it looks like something Apple designed”.\n-- Macaddict\n\n\n“I have been using this to keep track of all the places the kids and I go so they can see how spread out our world is and they can see where all we have gone. Will use it forever”.\n-- 1Cool Daddy\n\n\n“This app is extremely useful and so simple to use. A lifesaver for keeping track of locations”.\n-- Davies Photo\n\n\n“I love this app. It is exactly what it claims to be. I have wanted this app since the smartphone was invented. So simple, and so many uses”.\n-- T1Man\n\n\n\nUsing Pinbox on an iPod Touch or an iPad:\nLike other map apps, Pinbox uses GPS to determine your location. iPods and Wi-Fi-only iPads do not have a GPS receiver. On these devices, Pinbox provides your approximate location using information based on your proximity to known Wi-Fi networks (when on and available). The more accurate the available information, the smaller the circle identifying your position on the map. This feature is not available in all areas. Known Wi-Fi networks are predominantly in urban areas. An internet connection is required to load maps, look up addresses, and search. Although Pinbox can be installed on iPads, it’s not formatted for the larger iPad screen - it runs doubled like all other iPhone apps.\n\n\n\nPinbox is the result of a collaboration between Scott D. Smith and Paul Burd. We sincerely hope you like it!"

Watch in full screen, view in AR, search, add filters and so much more!\n\nShip Finder has been top rated and top ranking since 2009 and covers most of the world, tracking 20,000+ ships simultaneously.\n\nOur incredible app performance means that you can see all tracked vessels at once - no clustering here!\nSimply tap a ship to see its name, type, photos, speed, dimensions and much more.\nPowerful features such as filters, search and the ability to save favourite ships are included. (You can choose Apple or Google maps too!).\n\nAdd and browse bookmarks to saved locations around the globe to quickly navigate to areas or ports of interest.\n\nYou can even use Augmented Reality (AR) view to identify ships out at sea using your device camera. \n\nShip Finder works by picking up AIS ship feeds used by all passenger vessels, vessels over 300 tons and increasingly by smaller pleasure craft and yachts. This technology is actually faster than radar and is used by vessels for safety and navigation.\n\nShip Finder provides near real time “virtual radar” AIS maps. It’s easy to use and is an amazing app for anyone interested in shipping, cruising and sailing in ports and locations across the world. It’s also great if you simply want to know what boats are out there or want to see where your friends and family are. Ship Finder is also used extensively by maritime professionals and mariners.\n\nOur global AIS coverage is impressive and expanding all of the time as we add new AIS feeds and receivers. Please check www.shipfinder.co regularly to see the latest coverage.\n\nPinkfroot are committed to customer service and continually improve our Ship Finder apps based on feedback.

Your phone got you to the zoo, now use it to show you around once you’re inside!\n\nGet instant directions to animals, restaurants, rides and attractions, bathrooms and water fountains. Our interactive map guides you to where you want to go. Don’t use those paper maps, they are not eco-friendly and they are difficult to read - \nOur mapping works even if you don't have a signal (web-based maps can't do that). \n \nZooMap is not affiliated with the Jacksonville Zoo, but we love zoos and what they do for the community. When our CEO saw people enter the zoo and rush to a poorly executed wall map or try to navigate using outdated paper maps that are wasteful and not very eco-friendly.  He knew we could help. Our goal is to increase your fun, while saving your time (and trees).\n \nTap on screen icons, use the search bar or open main menu to find animals, food, rides and attractions – even bathrooms and water fountains on those hot days. Soon, you will be able to receive notifications concerning feeding times, ride closures or any other up to the minute information you need to have the best time possible in the zoo. \n\nZooMap Features\n\nSAVE PARKING SPACE\n-\tUpon arrival you can save your parking location and BetterMaps will bring you right back to where you parked at the end of the day.\n\nGET TO KNOW THE ANIMALS\n-\tUse our menus to see pics, learn about the animals; then get mapped right to them.\n\nGET DIRECTIONS VIRTUALLY ANYWHERE IN THE ZOO\n-\tFind Animals, Exhibits, Rides, Restaurant and shopping, then click the MapMe walker icon. You will see how far and approximate time to walk there. Click Go and our live map will bring you to your destination. Veer off course and BetterMaps will adapt in real time. \n\nBE IN THE KNOW (ONLY IF ZOO PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION)\n-\tReceive notifications updating you on ride and animal closures\n-\tReceive discounts from surrounding businesses\n\nFOR BUSINESS OWNERS: MALLS, ZOOS, PARKS, MUNICIPALITIES, AMUSEMENT\nBetterMaps takes maps to a whole new level – the micro-level. We create maps for smaller spaces, such as zoos, amusement parks, cemeteries and even municipalities and outdoor malls. Use Google or Apple Maps to get you there, use BetterMaps to get around. check out our website: www.bettermaps.app"

      "label": "BACKGROUND:\n\nBuilt from the ground up in the rugged mountains of eastern Afghanistan, Tactical NAV comes from the mind of a U.S. Army Field Artillery officer who had a vision of creating a low-cost and highly accurate tactical navigation platform built specifically for military service members.\n\nTactical NAV's journey began in the notorious Pech River Valley of Kunar Province, Afghanistan. \n\nU.S. Army Capt. Jonathan J. Springer, a Fire Support Officer with the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), began developing the tactical navigation platform following the memorial services for Spc. Blair D. Thompson and Spc. Jared C. Plunk, who were killed in action on June 25, 2010.\n\nAfter pitching the idea and being turned away by the Department of Defense on multiple occasions, Captain Jonathan J. Springer remained resolute in his mission to continue developing Tactical NAV — even to this day. His ultimate goals were (and still are) to make a difference for other Soldiers and honor the men and women killed and wounded in battle.\n\nHe used his life savings to continue moving forward with the Tactical NAV project, all with the ultimate hope of saving military lives and helping his fellow service members accomplish their mission at home and abroad.\n\nTactical NAV officially launched on the App Store on February 14, 2011.\n\nMISSION:\n\nTactical NAV's mission is to provide military service members with a low-cost, highly accurate, and exceedingly powerful mobile tactical navigational solution.\n\nVISION:\n\nOur vision is to assist and support our nation's service members with their mobile navigational needs and further enable them to operate and win during Multi-Domain Operations (MDO).\n\nBUILT FOR ACCURACY:\n\nTactical NAV's performance is on par with the AN/PSN-13 Defense Advanced GPS Receiver (DAGR), and it has the feedback to prove it.\n\nBOTTOM LINE:\n\nCreated on the battlefield, Tactical NAV was the very first MGRS-focused navigation app available on the App Store. It is also the only combat-proven app available today. It has proven to be effective across a multitude of environments all throughout the world.\n\nTactical NAV has been successfully evaluated against other software platforms and devices such as Nett Warrior, JCR, BFT, JBC-P, and ATAK. Its accuracy is within 1-to-3 meters of these officially approved systems issued by the Department of Defense.\n\nIAPs & SUBSCRIPTIONS: \n\nTactical NAV contains in-app purchases (IAPs) and subscriptions. Currently, tactical drawing mode is available as an in-app purchase, and offline mapping is also available to users as either a monthly or yearly subscription. All revenue generated from these features goes towards further developmental coding and updates, and a portion of all proceeds are donated to charities that specifically benefit disabled veterans. \n\nFEATURES:\n\n• A military-quality precision targeting platform\n• Purpose-built for the individual Soldier\n• Offline mapping capabilities (complete usage of the TACNAV platform with no emission of a cellular signal)\n• WGS 84 standard (MGRS, UTM, BNG, and USNG coordinates)\n• Tactical drawing mode (e.g., useful for Joint Fires planning, creating overlays, route planning, and so forth)\n• Waypoint plotting functionality with military graphics (per FM 1-02.2)\n• Compass \"FastLock\" function for capturing quick azimuths\n• Snap and save photographs onto the main map for intelligence purposes and AARs\n• Location, waypoint, and photo-sharing capabilities (via email and text)\n• One-button night mode function for low-light situations \n• \"Go to Grid\" option for intelligent pinpoint planning and drawing of overlays\n• Created and tested to ensure utmost accuracy and reliability \n• iOS native code built for austere and contested environments\n• And so much more!!!\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES:\n \nThe Department of Defense does not endorse Tactical NAV, nor should it be used in life-threatening or combat situations in place of a government-issued device."

      "label": "This app provides complete offline topographic map coverage of the North Island of New Zealand from the LINZ Topo50 1:50k scale map series.  The maps are all contained in the installation so there is no additional need for downloads, no need for phone or wifi signal, no slow server issues, no account signups, no missing tiles, and no additional map fees. Just install for seamless off-line zooming and panning across the whole island down to 1:50k scale. The app also includes 1:50k resolution satellite images for the island, and elevation data.\n\nOther integrated data includes DOC open and restricted hunting permit boundaries, DOC huts, campgrounds, and tracks, Fish and Game access points, and Te Araroa trails. Other datasets can be imported.\n\nThe app has a full suite of navigation functions including GPS location, compass orientation, distance to map locations, track recording and graphing, route creation and following, import/export of gpx and kml files, search functions for named places and user data. Add and edit your own locations and routes and plot elevation profiles. Uses an intuitive simple interface, with one-touch access to all functions.\n\nLINZ TOPO250 series maps are used at lower zoom levels for easier navigation.\n\nPerfect for outback use out of cell phone range. GPS and maps function fully without phone coverage. No need to cache files in advance either as they are all fully installed with the app. Popular with trampers, hikers, runners, bikers, search and rescue (SAR), hunters, boaters, as well as survey applications.\n\nNote that continuous use of GPS will run down the battery faster than when not using the GPS. The NZTopo50 app gives you full control over when GPS is used. The map can be used without GPS, intermittently with GPS for spot checking of location, continuously for logging while the app is open, or for continuous background logging when the phone is off. \n\nCheck our website for links to user guides and useful tips and tricks.\n\nFeel free to get in touch with any suggestions."

      "label": "Save time and money on your instrument flight training by mastering IFR holding pattern entries at the comfort of your own mobile device.\n\nMake IFR flight training easier!\n\nIs the following scenario familiar? You receive a holding clearance from ATC, and only have a couple of minutes, sometimes only a few seconds, to choose the correct entry. By the time you've figured out what's going on, you've already passed the holding fix and don't know what to do next.\n\nIf this sounds familiar, then you need not to worry. Confusion during holding entries happens to practically almost every new instrument student. Even instrument-rated pilots occasionally have the same problem — when they don't get enough practice.\n\nHolding Trainer solves this problem and as a result, cuts the time you have to spend on expensive flight and ground lessons. With Holding Trainer, you can practice on your own time and convenience, so that choosing the best holding entry in the air becomes a breeze. \n\n\nFeatures: \n\n-Entry Trainer - Drills you on choosing the best holding entry. Practice until choosing holding entries becomes second nature and impress your flight instructor with your skills.\n\n-Holding calculator. Solve and visualize any holding scenario by entering your current bearing to the fix and a outbound or inbound holding radial. \n\n-Holding tutorial - learn how to choose the best holding entry quickly and easily.\n\nHolding Trainer for iOS is a complete rewrite based on my popular Flash-based desktop Holding Trainer app available on pilotscafe.com.\n\n***Don't get \"stuck\" next time you receive a holding pattern clearance!***\n----------------------------------\nFor only a fraction of the cost of one ground lesson with your flight instructor, you can practice this important instrument skill at your own pace and save hundreds of Dollars on figuring out holding entries in the air.\n\nThis is a great tool for anyone training towards their instrument checkride, CFII, proficiency check, or simply trying to improve their holding patterns.\n----------------------------------"

      "label": "BlindSquare is pioneering accessible navigation both indoors and outdoors. Know where you are, know where you're going, travel with confidence.\n\nBlindSquare is a new solution that combines the latest technology to help the blind with their daily lives. It has been developed in collaboration with blind people and carefully field tested. You need either an iPhone or an iPad to get started. It also supports some additional accessories to enhance the experience. \n\nHow does it work? \n\nBlindSquare uses GPS and the compass to locate you. It then gathers information about the surrounding environment from FourSquare. BlindSquare has some unique algorithms to decide what information is the most relevant and then speaks it to you with high quality speech synthesis. \n“What's the most popular café within 200 meters radius? Where is the post office or the library?” \n\nYou can control BlindSquare also through voice commands. The Voice Command feature is a premium service requiring purchase of credits for continuous use.  Voice Command Credits are available as an in-app purchase on the App Store.\n\nUsing BlindSquare as a GPS solution:\n\nWhen you start the app, it will start telling you the interesting places and street crossings around you. By changing the radius, you can limit the area you are interested in. You can also search by search term or by category. You can select an interesting place from the search results and perform the following tasks:\n\n1) Get contact info (address, phone number) \n2) Open twitter feed or restaurant menu (if provided)\n3) Make a phone call\n4) Start tracking the place (BlindSquare will assist you by repeating the distance and the clock face direction)\n5) Start your favourite navigator for turn-by-turn instructions (TomTom, Navigon or Apple Maps)\n\nBlindSquare is aware of when you travel by car, bus or train and starts to report interesting places in front of you (for example, the next stops) and street crossings when you are passing them.\n\nYou can also save your own private places to iCloud so they will be found with your every device.\n\nUsing BlindSquare as a Foursquare client:\n\nIf you like to play Foursquare, you can do the following with BlindSquare:\n \n1) Get a list of nearby FourSquare venues\n2) When you are in a place, you can check in by shaking your device\n3) Do a check in with commenting and twitter/facebook sharing\n4) Correct the location of the place\n\nBlindSquare supports the following languages: English, Arabic, Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean (South Korea), Norwegian, Polish, Portugues, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish.\n\nVoiceOver usage is supported but it also includes higher quality additional speech synthesis by Acapela Text-To-Speech from Acapela Group.\n \nInstructions in English: https://www.blindsquare.com/user-guide/ and https://www.blindsquare.com/faq/\n\nPlease note: This app retrieves data in real time from Foursquare and Open Street Map. Use of a flat rate data plan is highly recommended.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nHaving only been released in May 2012, BlindSquare has already received several prizes and awards:\n\n - GSMA: Global Mobile Awards 2013, Best Mobile Health Product or Service\n - Apps4Finland 2012\n - OpenCities App Challenge 2012\n - The Finnish Information Processing Association: Best Product 2012\n\nPlease note: To use BlindSquare, your iCloud account has to be active so BlindSquare can access it to save your settings and places.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

      "label": "The legendary iOS compass app is now available for Apple Watch!  Pro Compass replicates the look and feel of classic pocket compass hardware in use since the 1800s.  The app uses advanced graphics technologies (normally reserved for games) to render 3D floating compass hardware for realistic operation.\n\nPro Compass offers true and magnetic compass modes using a damped rosette-style compass ring.  Local sun and moon position are shown on the compass ring and continually updated.  Pro Compass also displays location and altitude, with decimal and degree-minute-second formats.  The app contains a built-in two-axis inclinometer that drives two independent bubble levels and a bullseye level. \n\nNew in Pro Compass for Watch version 2 is a map screen and waypoint manager.  You can add waypoints on the map or at your current location, and view waypoints on the compass ring to visualize their bearing from your current location.\n\nPro Compass has settings for compass mode (true or magnetic), distance/altitude units (feet or meters), and position format (decimal degrees, degrees-minutes-seconds, MGRS, USNG, UTM, UTM-B, and Maidenhead Locator System).  The app has six color schemes, including two night vision modes - midnight red and luminescent green.\n\nPro Compass for Watch is recommended for Apple Watch Series 5 and later (including Ultra).  Apple Watch Series 4 and older do not have a compass sensor and will not show compass data.  On older devices, the app uses the device's gyro sensor to measure rotation.  You can twist the watch's digital crown to adjust and calibrate the gyro to the sun position, moon position, or a known bearing.  Using these references, the \"gyro compass\" is able to give bearing.  The calibration can be repeated as often as desired to give accurate results.\n\nAccuracy note: Pro Compass reports accuracy from the magnetometer sensor in your watch.  To improve results, operate Pro Compass away from magnets, electronics, or sources of electro-magnetic interference, including car dashboards, aircraft cockpits, metal structures, and other devices.\n\nDeveloper note: like all our apps, we plan to continually improve and evolve Pro Compass for Watch.  Please contact us with feature requests, suggestions, and general feedback.  We'd love to hear what you're doing with the app!"

Use our iHikeGPS app for these.\n\nHOW TOS\n\nTap Help in the app.\nOnline Manual: isailgps.com\nEmail developer: lwjames@isailgps.com\n\nRASTER CHARTS VS. VECTOR CHARTS\n\nThe National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration provides both RNC (raster) & ENC (vector) charts.\n\nThe great advantage of the high resolution RNC charts used by iSailGPS is the high level of detail produced by professional cartographers that is unobtainable on any vector-based chart. ENC Vector Charts only show a coastline, water depth, navigation aids & minimal details.\n\nThese RNC Charts differ from vector charts in that each chart covers a specific area, just as paper nautical charts do. Switches automatically to a new chart when your boat leaves the area covered by the previous chart. For most locations, there are multiple charts at different scales with different levels of detail & areas of coverage.\n\nPaper charts can have multiple panels, each showing a different area or scale. Each digital panel is individually displayed by iSailGPS with a north-up orientation.\n\nOther more expensive marine software uses these same RNC charts. iSail GPS is priced to make it readily available to all boating enthusiasts.\n\nDEVICE REQUIREMENTS\n\nNo device requires a cellular data plan to use iSailGPS.\n\nWiFi+cellular iPad 2 or later, & iPhone 4S or later support full navigation.\n\niPad 2 or later with WiFi-only, & iPod touch (5th gen or later) require an iOS-compatible external GPS receiver to show your location on the water and to record tracks. View charts using the iOS device alone.\n\n\nWinner of the Practical Sailor Editors’ Choice Award.\n\nSailing becomes safer and more fun with iSailGPS!"

Unlike simple tide clocks that you can buy in novelty stores, more accurate tide predictions use special data gathered by instruments located at each tide station. The data from these measurements are used to determine the harmonic components which then feed into the mathematical algorithms which predict tides for the future. The end results are tested for accuracy and adjustments are made as necessary.\n\nTide Graph has US owned Tide Stations Only.

For all mariners, from kayakers to ship captains.\n\nProduct Description:\n\nBased on the International and US Inland Navigation Rules along with the published edition of the USCG database of license exam questions, this App helps you master the Navigation Rules using a practice exam driven methodology.\n\nUsing NavRules you generate practice exams where you:\n• control the number of questions,\n• control the scope of the questions (international vs inland),\n• specify a filter (a text string that must appear in the question),\n• specify the rule the questions pertain to,\n• identify whether the question has been previously answered or not, or answered incorrectly or not.\nThis gives you control over the tests that are generated so you can focus your learning experience.\n\nAfter taking an exam you can review the results to see:\n• which questions were answered correctly,\n• for incorrect answers the correct answer,\n• the rule the question pertains to so you can understand the context of the question.\n\nEvery practice exam you take tracks your results relative the the Navigation Rules Question Pool.  By browsing the Question Pool you can see your progress on understanding each rule.\n\nFor each rule NavRules reposts:\n• your coverage (number of questions you have answered) and,\n• your proficiency (the percentage of questions you have answered correctly).\n\nIf you want to study a rule you can link directly to the questions related to that rule and choose the answers.  In this \"review\" mode you get immediate feedback on whether your answer is correct (but these results are not recorded and do not impact your rule coverage or proficiency).\n\nThe Flash Card mode lets you see all the diagrams used in the tests and from each of them see the questions that reference that diagram.\n\nThe included Rule Book provides:\n• index to US Inland, International and Canadian Rules,\n• link to all illustrations used in the Navigation Rules,\n• link to all vessel lights by vessel type,\n• definitions,\n• demarcation lines,\n• special terminology,\n• distress signals\n• references.\n\nOther features include:\n• over 1200 answered and referenced questions on the Navigation Rules,\n• complete copy of the Navigation Rules,\n• custom design your practice tests by number, filter, and type so you can focus on what you need to learn,\n• rules are clearly identified as Inland and International or both,\n• all practice tests results are stored until manually deleted,\n• Canadian Modifications to the Navigation Rules."

The entire circular image can be rotated to match the aircraft's heading to allow the pilot to visualize the aircraft's approach to the holding pattern. The aircraft's heading can either be set manually or automatically based on the magnetic heading of the iDevice being used.\n\nThis app is designed for optimal viewing and use on an iPad or iPhone 5 screen size or larger.

      "label": "Utah is a geologic wonderland with an incredible amount of canyons, trails, and public land. About two-thirds of Utah is owned by the US Government or the State government and can be enjoyed by everyone! The recreational opportunities range from boating and swimming to rock climbing, bicycling, and hiking.\n\nThis app is a one-stop resource for all of the public lands in Utah. It includes boundaries, trails, and data points for State Parks, National Parks, BLM Lands, and National Forests, as well as a variety of other point-of-interest information. All points and lines featured in this app are interactive and provide more information in a popup when tapped. The data is supplied as an elegant digital map that can easily be customized to show only the points that interest you.\n\nSome data sets include: Campgrounds, park offices, campsites, waterfalls, vistas, trailheads, hiking trails, tourist attractions, geologic points of interest, hot springs, meteorite recovery sites, boating access, and much more! Over 25,000 points are included, along with thousands of miles of trails and boundaries. Nobody else offers this much data aggregated into one convenient offline app. You do not want to explore Utah without this!\n\nIn addition to public data sets aggregated from around the internet, hundreds of independently mapped car campsites along roads in public lands are provided. This data set is proprietary and it is your key to finding the best free camping that Utah has to offer! Why pay $30/night to camp in a National Park when there are millions of acres of federal land where camping is free?\n\nNever get lost again with GPS based navigation and location / coordinate searches are included. Always know exactly where you are so that you can see what attractions are nearby and find what you're after. The navigation feature will work even when your phone is in airplane mode!\n\nA variety of detailed basemaps are provided: a road map, topo map, geologic map, aerial imagery, and more! Several layers have the capability to be downloaded for offline use so that you never have to worry about having reception or using cellular data in the remote wildernesses of Utah. An offline road map with limited view levels is even bundled in for your convenience.\n\nRelevant external links are included for reference and so that you can get the latest official information for a given park or forest without needing to search dozens of websites! Easily locate the major parks and forests and BLM land on the map with static programmed links that automatically pan and zoom the map to the area of interest. It doesn't get any simpler!\n\nNOTE: A great deal of information is included in this app as offline data. The consequence of this is that the app can be a little slow to respond when toggling and viewing certain layers at distant zoom levels. This issue was left unresolved in order to offer the maximum amount of data feasible rather than the fastest performance. If you struggle with this on an older phone, zoom in to an area of interest first. Please have patience when loading these layers and understand this quirk before purchasing the app. If you have any other problems, contact us and we will make it right. Thanks!\n\nGeoPOI LLC is a small, individually owned cartography business founded in Saint Paul, Minnesota. An immense amount of time and effort has gone in to this app in order to make it an invaluable tool for travelers and locals alike. By purchasing this app, you are essentially buying us a drink to fuel our efforts and ensure that quality apps like this will continue to be made in the future for other states. Thank you for your support! If you want to get a feel for the layout and format of the app before buying it, check out some of our other apps at https://geopoi.us\n\nWe welcome ideas for future updates; let us know what states you want to explore next!"

For example, an E6B can be used to calculate heading and groundspeed after taking into account forecast winds. An E6B is also used to calculate data used for performance planning such as density altitude.  Our version goes beyond the analog E6B and even beyond all other E6B apps by including functionality to calculate time, rate and radius of turns, pivotal altitude (great for flight training use), and more."

We have bridge heights and opening schedules for FL, GA, SC, NC, VA & CT. The app uses your GPS location to track your boat on the map to keep you aware of what bridges and no wake zones are coming up on your route.  NOAA boating charts can also be used as the base map!\n\nThis is a must have for recreational boaters in Florida and snowbirds cruising south for the winter down the ICW.  Boating in FL can be frustrating due to no wake zones and limited bridge openings.  Limited bridge openings could mean waits of up to an hour or more.  This tool will help you to stay informed and plan accordingly.\n\nThe app covers all of the waterways in Florida, including the Intracoastal Waterway (ICW), bays, inlets and canals.  Also covers key areas such as the Okeechobee Waterway, New River, and more.  Includes information from a variety of sources, including NOAA charts, state and federal Manatee Protection Zones, Boating Safety Zones and more. It covers the ICW all the way up to Chesapeake Bay, and all coastal waters and rivers up through VA.\n\nTide station information was also added.   For each tide station, the times for high and low tides each day are shown.  Tidal heights are included as well.\n\nNOAA Coastal Waters Forecasts are now included.  These include wave height forecasts up to five days out.  NOAA Raster Nautical Charts can also be used as the background maps.\n\nSpeed and heading data are now included.  If your primary GPS/plotter fails, you've got NOAA Charts, speed and heading...Everything you need!"

Perfect for travelers - research where you're covered across the USA (and now Canada!!) \n\n** Follow our Facebook page to get update alerts: http://www.facebook.com/CoverageMapApp, or check our support page**\n\nCoverage? focuses on helping mobile bandwidth junkies find cell signal as they roam.  Save time looking up coverage on the carrier's websites, compare their claims head to head and better plan your travels to stay connected. \n\n** The carrier's maps in your pocket: This app contains regional level maps based off of each major carrier's data map - as found on their website as of our last update. Quickly overlay the carriers you use to create your own personalized coverage map on your device. \n\n** No internet needed: Our proprietary coverage maps are stored within the app on your device - no downloading needed! Quickly access where you're supposed to get a signal, even when you have none. \n\n** Urban and rural areas: Maps are at a regional level, and cover the entire continental USA, Canada, Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands.\n\n** Carriers included: AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, US Cellular.\n** Canadian Carriers: Bell, Telus, Rogers (optional unlock)\n\n** Know where to roam: view 5G, LTE, and roaming areas as overlays, focus on finding the coverage type you desire. \n\nCheck http://www.twostepsbeyond.com/apps/coverage for a quick video demo.\n\nWe created this app because we are full time 'technomads' ourselves who rely on mobile data to work remotely. Keeping this app updated is a priority for us, as we depend on it ourselves!\n\n--------------\nCoverage FAQ: \nQ: Why aren't the maps more detailed or released more often? \nA: Our map updates require a lot of meticulous labor intensive processing. There's just no practical way to issue a new update every time a new tower is turned on. We monitor new coverage and try to find balance between effort & staying current.  This generally means at least a couple updates a year. \n\nQ: What makes 'Coverage?' unique? \nA: There are great apps out there that collect user submitted signal reports - we recommend them and use them ourselves. However, those apps are only useful in markets with an active user base. We took a different approach with Coverage? - we needed a tool to at least give us an idea of where signal should be - urban, rural, and out in the boonies.\n\n--------------\n\nNamed 'Essential Tool' by Wired Magazine\n\n** Winner - 'Most Useful App' - iOSDevCamp  \n\n\"this app can be indispensable\" - Lifehacker.com\n\n--------------\n\nThe maps in 'Coverage?' are provided in partnership with Ookla, and represent proprietary interpretations of the coverage reported by each carrier. You should not rely on the maps in Coverage to be perfectly precise or absolutely timely.  \n\nOngoing map updates have been free - but to support the ongoing development costs, we now allow customers to subscribe to higher resolution maps that will be updated more frequently. \n\nCoverage does not report or predict signal strength (there are great apps out there for that!). We can make no promises as to where you'll *actually* get signal.. there are too many variables - towers, device, terrain, weather, etc.\n\nSo… Got Coverage?\n\nAdditional information about The HD Maps Subscription:\n\nThis is an auto-renewable subscription, with a duration of one year. \n\nThe subscription fee will be charged to your iTunes account upon confirmation of purchase, and will automatically renew each year unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours prior to the end of the current subscription period.\n\nCurrent subscriptions may not be canceled during the active subscription period; however, you can manage your subscription and/or turn off auto-renewal by visiting your iTunes Account Settings after purchase.\n\nTerms of Use and Privacy Policy: http://www.twostepsbeyond.com/privacy/"

AyeTides displays tides and/or currents for over 12,500 locations worldwide and unlike many other tide apps, it does not require a network connection. With AyeTides you will never see those annoying ads or be asked to pay for additional features! Sailors, harbor pilots, beachcombers, nature photographers, and more use AyeTides to plan their outings on or around the world's oceans. \n\nHere are some of the things people are saying about AyeTides... \n\n\"AyeTides is a quality professional product”\n\n\"Your support has been the best I have experienced!\"\n\n“As a harbor pilot in New York I’ve been using your excellent tide and current app”\n\n\"I really appreciate the effort that you put into making AyeTides as accurate as it can be. It is a great program that has been very useful to us. I think we have 60 pilots using iPhones and iNavX and your app links in so well.\"\n\n\"I am a ships Pilot in BC and use Aye Tides a lot and it has become invaluable.”\n\nYou can see the day’s events in tabular form, or you can rotate the phone for an interactive graph that shows you the tide’s value at any point during the day. You can find a station on a map, by name, or based on your current location.\n\nAyeTides is updated regularly and stations are added whenever we find new data. We encourage our customers to contact us if you hare having any issues with the program so that we can help you. \n\nThis app is designed to run on your iPhone or iPod Touch. While it will run on your iPad, it does not offer the additional features available with AyeTides XL, which was designed specifically for the iPad. If you have multiple devices, you may want to consider our bundle. You get both apps at a discount!\n\nThis is the only place to install AyeTides. Other websites may look like they have AyeTides, but they do not. We only support iOS, any other version of AyeTides is not ours."

      "label": "“Awesome!!! The best speed app on iphone” 5 Stars by kurtonic\n\nSpeed Box is a Speedometer and GPS app for both your iPhone and iPad. It displays your current speed, distance, direction and altitude along with your top speed and average speed. The app also keeps a record of the speed and altitude for the last few hours.\n\n\nMAIN FEATURES\n========================\n\n* MPH, KM/H and KNOTS\n* Show decimal speed (e.g. \"45.7 mph\")\n* One app for both the iPhone and iPad\n* \"Speak speed\" - Tap screen to have the speed spoken to you\n* 11 Analog and digital speedometers\n* Map view\n* Maximum and average speed\n* Altitude \n* Digital compass \n* HUD display to see speed in windshield \n* Odometer to measure distance traveled \n* Chart of the traveled speed and altitude \n* Warning signal when driving too fast \n* Export last 3 hours of data \n* Change maximum displayed speed on speedometer \n* Swipe finger over chart to display historic data \n* Display GPS accuracy by tapping the indicator in the top left corner \n\n\nUSER REVIEWS\n========================\n\n5 Stars by Darekakuta \n\"Just what I needed. My '58 chev's speedo doesn't work. This did the trick.\" \n\n5 Stars by Rawd \n\"Great My 79 Firebird speedo only goes to 140 kmh. ;). This worked perfectly.\" \n\n5 Stars \n\"Within 1 mile per hour +/- Great Job!\" \n\nSpeedBox was one of the very early Speedometer Apps for the iPhone. Take advantage of my experience and the refined algorithms that can get a much greater accuracy from the iPhone then a lot of other apps. I regularly update my application to make it even more accurate and usable. \n\nUsers have already used our application to verify the accuracy of their car's speedometer or they tried measuring the speed they achieved while skiing. Can you come up with more ideas? How about measuring the speed of the airplane you travel with? \n\nUSAGE NOTES\n========================\nThe \"GPS strength\" indicator in the top left corner should display a green dot. You can tap this indicator to display the current GPS accuracy.\n\nPlease allow the application up to a minute to find enough satellites to work correctly. \n\nIf you get a message to enable GSP, please go to ”Settings > General > Location Services“ on your iPhone and check if the little switch is set to \"On\" for Speed Box as well as for \"Location Services\" in general. \n\nATTENTION iPod touch users! Unfortunately this app doesn't work very well on the iPod touch and the iPad WiFI (without 3G) since these devices are missing a GPS!\n\n\nFEEDBACK\n========================\nIf you've got any wishes or suggestions for new features, please let me know with the contact form on this application's website (see link below).\n\nI am already working on the next update!"

      "label": "The United States of America is a vast land full of breathtaking parks, indescribable landscapes, and fascinating history. You may already know some of the iconic landmarks the US has to offer, but did you know that there are more than 400 National Park Service properties? This app is your guide to discovering the unspeakable beauty that is contained within these fabled natural and cultural wonders!\n\nWhether you are a seasoned park explorer or are just wanting to learn a little more about the amazing places surrounding your home turf, this app is for you! The data is up to date as of Winter of 2020 and contains over 30,000 points of interest and other features on National Park Service land. These points are symbolized with over 60 color-coded icons that differentiate between the wide variety of categories. The six main groups for these categories include Amenities, Points of Interest, Recreation, Information & Historical, Lodging & Structures, and Transportation.\n\nThe app even distinguishes property boundaries and includes nearly 30,000 hiking and offroading trails.\n\nOnce using the app, there are five screens. The Guide screen will provide data legends as well as helpful tips for optimizing your navigational experience. On the Info screen, you will find a number of spatial links to the different NPS properties, parks, memorials, and monuments. This is a great way to quickly locate specific places and discover new parks! The About screen provides links to all of the open-source resources used in the app and gives a little information about the developer GeoPOI. The Map Settings screen is where you can change between one of four different basemaps, download offline imagery, turn on geolocation, and toggle specific point categories. Finally, the Map screen is where it all comes together!\n\nOn the Map screen, there are a series of circle clusters at distant zooms that indicate how many points are within a given cluster. As you tap the clusters to zoom in, individual points and icons become visible, along with trails and boundaries. These features can be clicked on to reveal the name, location, and other useful information. The map screen also has two search tools - the left one can be used to look up addresses and towns, while the right one will allow you to query the names of the features in the database.\n\nThere is such a wealth of beauty out there waiting to be discovered. Never before has it been this easy to navigate our National Parks as you travel, no matter where in the United States you are or what kinds of places you are interested in visiting. It's time to experience the rich natural and cultural tapestry of our nation and pay homage to the places that make our country the great land that it is. Come navigate the US National Park System with GeoPOI today!"

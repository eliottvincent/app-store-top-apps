A portion of the proceeds go to NYSSA to promote snowmobiling and other snowmobile club projects in New York State.\r\n\r\nThe NYSSA mobile app brings current snowmobile trail information and points of interest into live online and OFFLINE map capabilities. This is far from a static map as NYSSA’s 200+ clubs have LIVE access to update trail status as well as add warnings, reroutes and points of interest through their administrative access. Clubs also have access to add their own local trails, with new trails being added and updated regularly.\r\n\r\nSome of the highlights of the app:\r\n\r\n-Choose between both online (live updates) and OFFLINE maps. Offline maps updates are available daily.\r\n-See your current location and heading, allowing the app to follow your location.\r\n-Breadcrumb tracking of current location and new navigation mode.\r\n-View current trail status (open, closed, unreported), closures, and reroutes\r\n-Find fuel, food, lodging, parking and ride locations, parts and service, and scenic or points of interest recommended by NYSSA and clubs.\r\n-Click on trails or points of interest to see more information\r\n-Measure distances and areas\r\n-Choose between multiple basemaps including imagery\r\n-Search for locations and address\r\n-Toggle layers on and off\r\nPlease contact us (email link within the app) with suggestions for future updates. We look forward to working with the snowmobile community in our future development efforts!\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n*Trail status, reroutes, and related points are maintained by the clubs and may not always be accurate.\r\n**Continued use of GPS will quickly drain battery life. It is recommended to turn off GPS when not required or plug into a power source during extended use.\r\n***This purchase is for the 2022-2023 season. The app will continue to work through October 2023, and will time out on November 1st, 2023. Another purchase is required for the 2023-2024 season***"

      "label": "The Wasatch Backcountry Skiing Map is the iOS version of the popular paper map and website (visit WBSkiing.com). As with the other platforms, the iOS map includes an index to more than 1,000 backcountry locations in Utah’s Central Wasatch mountains. It is the must-have app for Utah hikers and backcountry travelers. \n\nWith a familiar map-app interface, the Wasatch Backcountry Skiing Map accesses your device’s GPS to display your current location on a high-resolution topo map. And with only a few taps, the “destination arrow” on the integrated compass will point to your desired backcountry ski location.\n\nAnd with a single tap, hundreds of the locations will open the Wasatch Backcountry Skiing Guide website where you can view photographs and detailed information about the location.\n\nThe app also displays your current elevation and lat/long, and will send your current location via email. And with a tap, you can display detailed information on more than 200 of the locations including skiing difficulty, skinning distance, vertical climb, parking considerations, and more.\n\n(Contrary to a posted review, you don't need cell service to use this app--you don't even need a contract with a cell service provider.)\n\nNOTICES: When navigating, the “destination arrow” points directly to the destination without regard to hazards such as avalanche paths, cliffs, and rock fall. It is your responsibility to travel in the backcountry safely."

      "label": "Theodolite is a multi-function viewfinder that combines a compass, two-axis inclinometer, rangefinder, GPS, map, nav calculator, and geo-overlay photo/movie camera into one indispensable app. Theodolite was one of the very first augmented reality (AR) apps when it was released in 2009, and it’s been downloaded and used by millions of customers since then. Uses are endless, and the app is great for land measurements, outdoor sports, sightseeing, navigation, and finding your way around. Theodolite is a pro grade app and is used extensively by surveyors, geologists, architects, engineers, competitive sportsmen, first responders, military personnel, and search and rescue workers around the world. \n\nTheodolite lets you take data-overlay photos and movies with 2X-8X zoom. Overlay geographical data, angle markings, date/time, author/company info, and project notes directly on photos and movies for later reference. The same data is written into the metadata record of images, making image files self-contained data records. Third-party apps can tap into Theodolite's advanced camera functions with a camera sharing feature.\n\nView current position on the built-in map with optional offline Outdoors maps that include topo contours, roads, trails, landmarks, campgrounds, ski lifts, and more. Live map markers continually update distance/heading relative to the current location and also show wayfinding info in the main viewfinder. Draw polygons on the map to mark things like property boundaries and trails, and import/export polygon data via KML.\n\nShare map markers and nav calculator points with other users of Theodolite via text messages or e-mail. This powerful capability opens up a wide range of collaborative uses including team land surveying, accident investigations, spotting wild fires, triangulation of landmarks, and advanced tactical observation and targeting. With an optional in-app purchase to enable team tracking, you can share location with up to 20 people on Theodolite's map.\n\nTheodolite includes features for serious users like a reference angle mode, nav calculator, map marker import/export, manual and automatic data logging with CSV and KML export, clipboard integration, %grade display, mil compass readout, optical rangefinders (including a mil-based reticle, sniper-style stadiametric graphs, and a variable 4X-24X scope), and night filters to improve use in dark conditions.\n\nTheodolite can provide location in military grid reference system (MGRS) coordinates, Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates, British/Irish National Grids, US National Grid, Maidenhead locator system, Map Grid of Australia, and six latitude/longitude formats. Optional US State Plane coordinates include SPCS27 and SPCS83 zones covering all US States. The optional Datum Pack adds over 230 geodetic datums to the app to improve position computation from GPS data, covering regions and countries on all continents around the world.\n\nAR Layers include navigational aids like the sun, moon, planets, and Polaris (North star), and the optional US Mountain Summits layer that shows over 70,000 US mountain summits in the viewfinder.\n\nTheodolite has been shown in Apple Keynotes, featured on the App Store, and has been a #1 selling Navigation app in App Stores around the world. Since its introduction in 2009, Theodolite has defined augmented reality navigation. The app continually introduces new technologies, pushing the limits of iOS app development and taking advantage of new hardware capabilities.\n\nFind out why Apple named Theodolite one of the most amazing apps available and showed it being used to explore the Great Wall of China. Where will you take it on your next adventure?\n\nNote: Theodolite is an iPhone app -- see “Theodolite HD” for use on an iPad. And be sure to check out the all-new \"Theodolite for Watch\" and put Theodolite on your wrist!"

Soon, you will be able to receive notifications concerning feeding times, ride closures or any other up to the minute information you need to have the best time possible in the zoo. \n\nZooMap Features\n\nSAVE PARKING SPACE\n-\tUpon arrival you can save your parking location and BetterMaps will bring you right back to where you parked at the end of the day.\n\nGET TO KNOW THE ANIMALS\n-\tUse our menus to see pics, learn about the animals; then get mapped right to them.\n\nGET DIRECTIONS VIRTUALLY ANYWHERE IN THE ZOO\n-\tFind Animals, Exhibits, Rides, Restaurant and shopping, then click the MapMe walker icon. You will see how far and approximate time to walk there. Click Go and our live map will bring you to your destination. Veer off course and BetterMaps will adapt in real time. \n\nBE IN THE KNOW (ONLY IF ZOO PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION)\n-\tReceive notifications updating you on ride and animal closures\n-\tReceive discounts from surrounding businesses\n\nFOR BUSINESS OWNERS: MALLS, ZOOS, PARKS, MUNICIPALITIES, AMUSEMENT\nBetterMaps takes maps to a whole new level – the micro-level. We create maps for smaller spaces, such as zoos, amusement parks, cemeteries and even municipalities and outdoor malls. Use Google or Apple Maps to get you there, use BetterMaps to get around. check out our website: www.bettermaps.app"

(You can choose Apple or Google maps too!).\n\nAdd and browse bookmarks to saved locations around the globe to quickly navigate to areas or ports of interest.\n\nYou can even use Augmented Reality (AR) view to identify ships out at sea using your device camera. \n\nShip Finder works by picking up AIS ship feeds used by all passenger vessels, vessels over 300 tons and increasingly by smaller pleasure craft and yachts. This technology is actually faster than radar and is used by vessels for safety and navigation.\n\nShip Finder provides near real time “virtual radar” AIS maps. It’s easy to use and is an amazing app for anyone interested in shipping, cruising and sailing in ports and locations across the world. It’s also great if you simply want to know what boats are out there or want to see where your friends and family are. Ship Finder is also used extensively by maritime professionals and mariners.\n\nOur global AIS coverage is impressive and expanding all of the time as we add new AIS feeds and receivers. Please check www.shipfinder.co regularly to see the latest coverage.\n\nPinkfroot are committed to customer service and continually improve our Ship Finder apps based on feedback. Why not join our online community at www.pinkfroot.com or if you have any questions please email us via support@pinkfroot.com and we’ll be happy to help. \n\nDisclaimer: Ship Finder should not be used for navigational purposes. \nUnder no circumstances will the developer of this application be held responsible for incidents resulting from the use of the data or its interpretation."

What's the cost of my driving?\nBased on gas price for a gallon or litre, MPG (U.S. or UK) or liters per 100 km the app will tell you what the cost is as you drive. You can add an extra cost per kilometer or mile! Useful for all cost aware drivers and for splitting the cost between passengers.\n\n‣‣ GPS TRACKING. Where I've been? How long did it take to get from A to B? \nSpeedometer records your trip statistics even when GPS tracker is switched off. When you need point by point data to see on the map later or export (Google Earth and GPX), speedometer gives you the first class GPS tracker.\n\n‣‣ INFOTAINMENT. \nWhen switched on, infotainment shows trip stats or weather/wind forecast  when you wait. Way better than just showing you a 0 speed!\n\n‣‣ Easy to set speed limits and SPEED LIMIT MEMORY option\nSet speed limits with 4 or 8 fast and configurable presets. Presets only need a single tap and are the safest way to set the limits! With SPEED LIMIT MEMORY you just apply the speed limit once and the app applies it for you automatically the next time!\n\n‣‣ MODES\nUse MENU>MODES to turn the app into a Rally computer, G-Force monitor, Camera alerter or taximeter! Currently there are 12 modes available and we are constantly adding new ones.\n\n‣‣ WAYPOINTS.\nSpeedometer gives you the unique way to leave a note with location and even optional photo or audio note attached! As easy as double tap on the big speed digits! You'll find more in a documentation section (star button).\n\n‣‣ RED LIGHT & SPEED CAMERAS\nImport camera data into speedometer in Garmin or iGO csv formats from poi-factory.com, scdb.info or poi-plaza and let speedo alert you on a camera approach and set speed limit automatically before you pass the speed camera!\n\n‣‣ SUNSET/SUNRISE\nWith the sunset and sunrise information that our speedometer provides, you'll be able to avoid driving in the dusk.\n\n‣‣ BARO VSI. Barometric Vertical Speed Indicator (VSI, IVSI) in both scale and graph forms.\n\n‣‣ VOICE COACH.

This app is your guide to discovering the unspeakable beauty and recreational potential that is contained within these fabled domains!\n\nWhether you are a seasoned forest wanderer or are just wanting to learn a little more about the amazing places surrounding your home turf, this app is for you! The data is up to date as of Summer, 2022, and contains over 53,000 recreational points and other features on BLM land. These points are symbolized with several color-coded icons that differentiate between the . Categories include Access Points, Boating, Campgrounds, POIs, Vistas, Bathrooms, Parking Lots, Recreational Areas, and much more! The app even distinguishes property boundaries and includes some hiking trails and roads.\n\nNew in this release! We listened to your requests and have added several improvements and new features including a custom My Points tool! Now you can save your own points of interest and give them a unique color and icon. Mark where you park the car, where you saw a neat feature, or an epic campsite. You can even export these points for use with other devices!\n\nOnce using the app, there are five screens. The Guide screen will provide data legends as well as helpful tips for optimizing your navigational experience. On the Info screen, you will find a number of spatial links to the different BLM properties. This is a great way to quickly locate specific places and discover new places to explore! The About screen provides links to all of the open-source resources used in the app and gives a little information about the developer GeoPOI. The Map Settings screen is where you can change between one of four different basemaps, download offline imagery, turn on geolocation, and toggle specific point categories. Finally, the Map screen is where it all comes together!\n\nOn the Map screen, there are a series of circle clusters at distant zooms that indicate how many points are within a given cluster. As you tap the clusters to zoom in, individual points and icons become visible, along with trails, roads, and boundaries. These features can be clicked on to reveal the name, location, and other useful information. The map screen also has two search tools - the left one can be used to look up addresses and towns, while the right one will allow you to query the names of the features in the database.\n\nThere is such a wealth of beauty out there waiting to be discovered.

      "label": "Theodolite was one of the earliest augmented reality (AR) apps for iOS when it debuted in 2009 -- in fact Theodolite was pioneering AR technology before \"AR\" was even a buzzword! In the time since, Theodolite has been used by millions of consumers and professionals in their outdoor adventures and on the job. Now, we've taken the Theodolite concept to Apple Watch by combining a compass, inclinometer, GPS, and maps into one indispensable app that sits on your wrist. We're excited to keep evolving this centuries-old instrument as hardware and software technologies allow the concept to come to new device formats.\n\nOn iPhone and iPad, Theodolite uses a viewfinder format, uniting the device sensors (GPS, magnetometer, gyro, accelerometer) and camera.  On Apple Watch, Theodolite combines data from these sensors into an AHRS (attitude and heading reference system) layout similar to what you'd see in the glass cockpit of a modern aircraft. This layout allows Theodolite to efficiently display compass bearing (yaw angle), pitch angle, and roll angle in a compact format that works extremely well on a small screen.  This information is augmented by latitude, longitude, and altitude from GPS, as well as sun and moon position.\n\nNew in Theodolite for Watch version 2 is a map screen and waypoint manager.  You can add waypoints on the map or at your current location, and view waypoints on the compass ring to visualize their bearing from your current location.\n\nTheodolite has settings for compass mode (true or magnetic), distance/altitude units (feet or meters), and position format (decimal degrees, degrees-minutes-seconds, MGRS, USNG, UTM, UTM-B, and Maidenhead Locator System).  Users can choose to display an artificial horizon in the center of the app display (tied to pitch and roll) and can set the app's level reference to flat or vertical orientations of the Watch.  The app has six color schemes, including two night vision modes - midnight red and luminescent green.\n\nTheodolite for Watch is recommended for Apple Watch Series 5 and later (including Ultra).  Apple Watch Series 4 and older do not have a compass sensor and will not show compass data.  On older devices, the app uses the device's gyro sensor to measure rotation.  You can twist the watch's digital crown to adjust and calibrate the gyro to the sun position, moon position, or a known bearing.  Using these references, the \"gyro compass\" is able to give bearing.  The calibration can be repeated as often as desired to give accurate results.\n\nTheodolite reports accuracy from the magnetometer sensor in your Watch.  To improve results, operate Theodolite away from magnets, electronics, or sources of electro-magnetic interference, including car dashboards, aircraft cockpits, metal structures, and other devices.\n\nLike all our apps, we plan to continually improve and evolve Theodolite for Watch.  Please contact us with feature requests, suggestions, and general feedback.  We'd love to hear what you're doing with the app!  And if you don't already have Theodolite for your iPhone or iPad, check it out!"

      "label": "This app puts the Mayan Dreamspell Calendar in your pocket! \"13:20:Sync makes it so much easier to understand and integrate the calendar into every day life. Highly recommend it.\" \n\nThe Mayan People have described, in breathtaking precision, the cycles of both the universe and nature around us. They created a harmonic calendar that is synchronized to all those cycles. Following these cycles can help you get a stronger connection with nature around you and become conscious of your essence.\n\nThis app provides a simple way to sync along those cycles, to raise our frequency and give us a new lens to view both our day-to-day and planetary events.\n\n- Did you ever realize that our (Gregorian) calendar is not a harmonic calendar? \n- Did you know that the moon has 13 (not 12!) orbits around the earth in 1 year? \n- Why do we live with this irregular calendar?\n- Are you interested in Astrology?\n\n-> All this, and more, is explained carefully in this app. (over 15.000 words on 37 pages) Please note that these text are in English language only.\n\nIn the New Time, synchronicity is the norm.\n\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// \n5 star rating across the world! \n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// \n\"Entertaining as well as enlightening\" \n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// \n\nMORE INFO: \nwww.1320sync.com \n\n\nFor the beginner this app is a learning tool because it contains an extensive explanation about Tones and Seals and the synchronizing order of the Mayan Astrology. You may think it's difficult at first but soon you will feel how it all connects. \n\n\"This app is great, and allows easy manipulation of dates. I spent years in books doing in hours what I can now do in seconds.\"\n\nFor the ones who are already familiar with the Mayan Calendar this app is a handy tool to navigate the cycles, and calculate the Combined Kin for any given combination. Furthermore this app can be of great assistance to teach other people about the 13:20 cycles and is used in teachings around the world.\n\n\n=== FEATURES ===\n\n+ Kin Calendar\nThis is your main Mayan Dreamspell Calendar Dashboard with all the details you need to stay in sync. Shows the Kin of today by default, and you can calculate the Kin for any other date.\n\n+ Personal Notes\nOn this new page you can keep your personal notes for the 2 main cycles of time: the Tzolkin cycle of 260 days and the 13 Moon cycle of 365 days. And with the powerful text search function you quickly find your notes.\n\n+ Kin Picker\nSelect any combination of the 13 Tones and 20 Seals. Top section can scroll to 4 pages with information.\n\n+ Combined Kin Calculator \nCalculate the Combined Kin of any combination of Kin. You can add as many Kin as you like to calculate the Combined Kin for a group of people. \n\n+ Tzolkin with indication of the GAP day's and Wavespell and more. Tap and hold to select a Kin number directly.\n\n+ Contact Import \nAll contacts in your Contacts App will be automatically imported and assigned to the correct Kin. See all your contacts with their Mayan Reading and how you relate to them. \n\n+ 13 Moon Calendar \nFull integration of 13 Moon Calendar. (doubles as a birthday calendar!) \n\n+ 13:20 Information \nLots of information about the theory behind synchronization to help you navigate the Mayan Dreamspell Calendar.

      "label": "This app provides complete offline topographic map coverage of the South Island of New Zealand from the LINZ Topo50 1:50k scale map series.  The maps are all contained in the installation so there is no additional need for downloads, no need for phone or wifi signal, no slow server issues, no account signups, no missing tiles, and no additional map fees. Just install for seamless off-line zooming and panning across the whole island down to 1:50,000 scale. The app also includes 1:50k resolution satellite images for the island and elevation data.\n\nOther integrated data includes DOC open and restricted hunting permit boundaries, DOC huts, campgrounds, and tracks, Fish and Game access points, and Te Araroa trails. Other datasets can be imported.\n\nThe app has a full suite of navigation functions including GPS location, compass orientation, distance to map locations, track recording and graphing, route creation and following, import/export of gpx and kml files, search functions for named places and user data. Add and edit your own locations and routes and plot elevation profiles. Uses an intuitive simple interface, with one-touch access to all functions.\n\nLINZ TOPO250 series maps are used at lower zoom levels for easier navigation.\n\nPerfect for outback use out of cell phone range. GPS and maps function fully without phone coverage. No need to cache files in advance either as they are all fully installed with the app. Popular with trampers, hikers, runners, bikers, search and rescue (SAR), hunters, boaters, as well as survey applications.\n\nNote that continuous use of GPS will run down the battery faster than when not using the GPS. The NZTopo50 app gives you full control over when GPS is used. The map can be used without GPS, intermittently with GPS for spot checking of location, continuously for logging while the app is open, or for continuous background logging when the phone is off. \n\nCheck our website for links to user guides and useful tips and tricks.\n\nFeel free to get in touch with any suggestions."

In fact, we recommend that you place your phone in Airplane Mode if you are in an area with limited or partial phone service to conserve your battery.\nTrail Treker will also electronically, via GPS location, show local businesses and points of interest. You can store your own points of interest as well. Key points such as survival shelters, supplies, or emergency evacuation points may be shown on various maps.\n\nThe Trail Treker app will allow you to download any member map.

      "label": "Welcome to the BetterMaps ZooMap app, Bronx Zoo version. Our custom interactive map plans the shortest route to your destination. Our mapping works even if you don't have a signal (web-based maps can't do that). Find animals, rides & attractions, food and more and our map will guide you to your destination. Get food (or a beer) and find the bathrooms when you're done (quickly!) Walk around knowing you don't have to remember where you parked (we do that for you - then bring you back to the car at the end of a long day). So have fun and get mapped. Free! - other zoos coming soon. \n \nZooMap is not affiliated with the Bronx Zoo but we are a New York company (located in Brooklyn), and we LOVE the Bronx Zoo. When our CEO saw people enter the zoo and rush to a poorly executed wall map or try to navigate using an outdated paper map (uh, save the planet much?) he knew we could help. Our goal is to increase your fun, while saving your time (and trees).\n\nThe BetterMaps ZooMap, Bronx Zoo version truly is the best way to explore the Bronx Zoo (more zoos are coming online very soon) without missing anything that you and/or the family want to see during your visit. The ZooMap digital guide brings you a whole new level of closeness to everything the Bronx Zoo has to offer. Once you have found what you are looking for, our custom algorithm shows you route overview, how away you are, and approximate time to walk there. Simply hit Go and just follow the blue line to get there. Our flashlight points you in the right direction (use your phone as a wayfinder). Veer off the path, no problem, our map adapts to your movements and reroutes instantly.  \n\nTap onscreen icons, use the search bar or drop down menu to find animals, food, rides and attractions – even bathrooms and water fountains on those hot days. Soon you will be able to receive notifications concerning feeding times, ride closures or any other up to the minute information you need to have the best time possible in the zoo.  \n\nZooMap Features\n\nSAVE PARKING SPACE\n-\tUpon arrival you can save your parking location and BetterMaps will bring you right back to where you parked at the end of the day – no more having to use your door lock fob to find your car beeping in the distance.\n\nGET TO KNOW THE ANIMALS\n-\tUse our menus to learn about the animals, species and where they are from.\n\nGET DIRECTIONS VIRTUALLY ANYWHERE IN THE ZOO\n-\tFind Animals, Exhibits, Rides, Restaurant and shopping, then click the MapMe walker icon. You will see how far and approximate time to walk there. Click Go and our live map will bring you to your destination. Veer off course and BetterMaps will adapt in real time. \n\nBE IN THE KNOW\n-\tReceive notifications updating you on ride and animal closures\n-\tReceive discounts from surrounding businesses\n\nFOR BUSINESS OWNERS: MALLS, ZOOS, PARKS, MUNICIPALITIES, AMUSEMENT\nBetterMaps takes maps to a whole new level – the micro-level. We create maps for smaller spaces, such as zoos, amusement parks, cemeteries and even municipalities and outdoor malls. Use Google or Apple Maps to get you there, use BetterMaps to get around. check out our website: www.bettermaps.app\n\nBut we do more than just help you visitors navigate, we provide communications as well – send out the latest news and updates, tell your visitors what’s going on before they arrive.\n\nGet information into the hands of your customers: food and drink specials, shopping deals, popup sales and other updates to make their day more rewarding and keep them coming back."

      "label": "Wake Watch is the Boater's Resource for information on no wake zones, boating speed limits and bridges. We have no wake zone and boating speed limit maps for FL, NC & CT.  We have bridge heights and opening schedules for FL, GA, SC, NC, VA & CT. The app uses your GPS location to track your boat on the map to keep you aware of what bridges and no wake zones are coming up on your route.  NOAA boating charts can also be used as the base map!\n\nThis is a must have for recreational boaters in Florida and snowbirds cruising south for the winter down the ICW.  Boating in FL can be frustrating due to no wake zones and limited bridge openings.  Limited bridge openings could mean waits of up to an hour or more.  This tool will help you to stay informed and plan accordingly.\n\nThe app covers all of the waterways in Florida, including the Intracoastal Waterway (ICW), bays, inlets and canals.  Also covers key areas such as the Okeechobee Waterway, New River, and more.  Includes information from a variety of sources, including NOAA charts, state and federal Manatee Protection Zones, Boating Safety Zones and more. It covers the ICW all the way up to Chesapeake Bay, and all coastal waters and rivers up through VA.\n\nTide station information was also added.   For each tide station, the times for high and low tides each day are shown.  Tidal heights are included as well.\n\nNOAA Coastal Waters Forecasts are now included.  These include wave height forecasts up to five days out.  NOAA Raster Nautical Charts can also be used as the background maps.\n\nSpeed and heading data are now included.  If your primary GPS/plotter fails, you've got NOAA Charts, speed and heading...Everything you need!"

It is a national asset, the most visited mountain in the UK, attracting people from across Wales, the UK and around the world.\n\nThis app is designed by the Snowdonia National Park Authority together with partners who are responsible for the on-the-ground management of the mountain. The work ranges from conservation and path management to tourism, farming and mountain rescue.\n\nOur simple to use GPS-enabled app covers the 6 main paths to the summit of Yr Wyddfa with detailed route maps that tracks your progress as you ascend. This works offline, meaning no internet or phone signal is required when using the app on the mountain. Each map also includes contour information so you can look out for hazardous sections as you climb.\n\nThis app will also help you plan ahead before your visit and includes important advice which will allow you to help us respect, care, and protect this incredible mountain, the surrounding environment and local communities.\n\nContains OS data © Crown copyright and database right 2020.\n\nThis walking app was developed for Partneriaeth Yr Wyddfa by Tinymobile Limited.

      "label": "Pro Compass replicates the look and feel of classic pocket compass hardware in use since the 1800s, adding modern features and technologies.  The app uses advanced OpenGL graphics (normally reserved for games) to render 3D floating compass hardware for realistic operation.\n\nPro Compass offers nine different compass modes with direct read, traditional, and rosette styles capable of displaying degrees, quads, or mils (the direct read mode shows a North-South needle and reversed East-West convention).  In all display modes, Pro Compass shows both magnetic and true direction simultaneously, with a rotating outer true ring that is automatically adjusted for local magnetic declination.  Sun and Moon position are marked on the compass rings and continually updated.\n\nPro Compass displays location and altitude, with decimal, degree-minute-second, UTM, and MGRS position formats.  An optional \"Datum Pack\" adds over 230 geodetic datums covering regions and countries on all continents around the world.  The app also contains a built in two-axis inclinometer that drives two independent bubble levels and a bullseye level.  The inclinometer has angle readout dials for each axis, making it useful for many different types of measurements including slopes, pitches, sight lines, and geological angles like dip and strike. \n\nAfter using Pro Compass, you'll see why it's the best and most realistic compass available on the App Store!  Also be sure to check out the new Pro Compass for Watch, available for all Apple Watch models running watchOS 6 or later.\n\n***** IMPORTANT ACCURACY NOTE *****\n\nPro Compass reports accuracy directly from the magnetometer sensor in your device.  This accuracy is determined by the hardware, not the application itself.\n\nTo improve results, operate Pro Compass away from any electronics or other sources of electro-magnetic interference, including car dashboards, aircraft cockpits, metal structures, and other devices.  \n\nPlease contact the developer via the support link if you need additional information about accuracy or operation of Pro Compass."

You can make the terrain stand out with hill shading, using simulated sunlight from the direction of your choice.  In the U.S., this app does not use the new \"US Topo\" maps because they do not show hiking trails and lack other details: please see the web site for more details.\n\nDownloading: US maps are around 8 MB in size and download in a few seconds on a typical home broadband connection.  Canadian maps are larger.  Both cellular data and WiFi can be used, though WiFi is likely to be more reliable in most cases.\n\n- Do please visit http://topomapsapp.com/ for complete instructions, so that you don't miss any features.\n\nWe have many ideas for additional features to add to future versions of this app; if you have ideas or other questions or comments, contact details can be found on the website, http://topomapsapp.com/.

      "label": "Never be without the tides again!\n\nYou too can carry the tides in your pocket (or now, on your wrist!) as you walk along the shore, fly into a harbor, or sail off into the sunset. AyeTides displays tides and/or currents for over 12,500 locations worldwide and unlike many other tide apps, it does not require a network connection. With AyeTides you will never see those annoying ads or be asked to pay for additional features! Sailors, harbor pilots, beachcombers, nature photographers, and more use AyeTides to plan their outings on or around the world's oceans. \n\nHere are some of the things people are saying about AyeTides... \n\n\"AyeTides is a quality professional product”\n\n\"Your support has been the best I have experienced!\"\n\n“As a harbor pilot in New York I’ve been using your excellent tide and current app”\n\n\"I really appreciate the effort that you put into making AyeTides as accurate as it can be. It is a great program that has been very useful to us. I think we have 60 pilots using iPhones and iNavX and your app links in so well.\"\n\n\"I am a ships Pilot in BC and use Aye Tides a lot and it has become invaluable.”\n\nYou can see the day’s events in tabular form, or you can rotate the phone for an interactive graph that shows you the tide’s value at any point during the day. You can find a station on a map, by name, or based on your current location.\n\nAyeTides is updated regularly and stations are added whenever we find new data. We encourage our customers to contact us if you hare having any issues with the program so that we can help you. \n\nThis app is designed to run on your iPhone or iPod Touch. While it will run on your iPad, it does not offer the additional features available with AyeTides XL, which was designed specifically for the iPad. If you have multiple devices, you may want to consider our bundle. You get both apps at a discount!\n\nThis is the only place to install AyeTides. Other websites may look like they have AyeTides, but they do not. We only support iOS, any other version of AyeTides is not ours."

      "label": "Save time and money on your instrument flight training by mastering IFR holding pattern entries at the comfort of your own mobile device.\n\nMake IFR flight training easier!\n\nIs the following scenario familiar? You receive a holding clearance from ATC, and only have a couple of minutes, sometimes only a few seconds, to choose the correct entry. By the time you've figured out what's going on, you've already passed the holding fix and don't know what to do next.\n\nIf this sounds familiar, then you need not to worry. Confusion during holding entries happens to practically almost every new instrument student. Even instrument-rated pilots occasionally have the same problem — when they don't get enough practice.\n\nHolding Trainer solves this problem and as a result, cuts the time you have to spend on expensive flight and ground lessons. With Holding Trainer, you can practice on your own time and convenience, so that choosing the best holding entry in the air becomes a breeze. \n\n\nFeatures: \n\n-Entry Trainer - Drills you on choosing the best holding entry. Practice until choosing holding entries becomes second nature and impress your flight instructor with your skills.\n\n-Holding calculator. Solve and visualize any holding scenario by entering your current bearing to the fix and a outbound or inbound holding radial. \n\n-Holding tutorial - learn how to choose the best holding entry quickly and easily.\n\nHolding Trainer for iOS is a complete rewrite based on my popular Flash-based desktop Holding Trainer app available on pilotscafe.com.\n\n***Don't get \"stuck\" next time you receive a holding pattern clearance!***\n----------------------------------\nFor only a fraction of the cost of one ground lesson with your flight instructor, you can practice this important instrument skill at your own pace and save hundreds of Dollars on figuring out holding entries in the air.\n\nThis is a great tool for anyone training towards their instrument checkride, CFII, proficiency check, or simply trying to improve their holding patterns.\n----------------------------------"

For example, an E6B can be used to calculate heading and groundspeed after taking into account forecast winds. An E6B is also used to calculate data used for performance planning such as density altitude.  Our version goes beyond the analog E6B and even beyond all other E6B apps by including functionality to calculate time, rate and radius of turns, pivotal altitude (great for flight training use), and more."

The entire circular image can be rotated to match the aircraft's heading to allow the pilot to visualize the aircraft's approach to the holding pattern. The aircraft's heading can either be set manually or automatically based on the magnetic heading of the iDevice being used.\n\nThis app is designed for optimal viewing and use on an iPad or iPhone 5 screen size or larger.

For all mariners, from kayakers to ship captains.\n\nProduct Description:\n\nBased on the International and US Inland Navigation Rules along with the published edition of the USCG database of license exam questions, this App helps you master the Navigation Rules using a practice exam driven methodology.\n\nUsing NavRules you generate practice exams where you:\n• control the number of questions,\n• control the scope of the questions (international vs inland),\n• specify a filter (a text string that must appear in the question),\n• specify the rule the questions pertain to,\n• identify whether the question has been previously answered or not, or answered incorrectly or not.\nThis gives you control over the tests that are generated so you can focus your learning experience.\n\nAfter taking an exam you can review the results to see:\n• which questions were answered correctly,\n• for incorrect answers the correct answer,\n• the rule the question pertains to so you can understand the context of the question.\n\nEvery practice exam you take tracks your results relative the the Navigation Rules Question Pool.  By browsing the Question Pool you can see your progress on understanding each rule.\n\nFor each rule NavRules reposts:\n• your coverage (number of questions you have answered) and,\n• your proficiency (the percentage of questions you have answered correctly).\n\nIf you want to study a rule you can link directly to the questions related to that rule and choose the answers.  In this \"review\" mode you get immediate feedback on whether your answer is correct (but these results are not recorded and do not impact your rule coverage or proficiency).\n\nThe Flash Card mode lets you see all the diagrams used in the tests and from each of them see the questions that reference that diagram.\n\nThe included Rule Book provides:\n• index to US Inland, International and Canadian Rules,\n• link to all illustrations used in the Navigation Rules,\n• link to all vessel lights by vessel type,\n• definitions,\n• demarcation lines,\n• special terminology,\n• distress signals\n• references.\n\nOther features include:\n• over 1200 answered and referenced questions on the Navigation Rules,\n• complete copy of the Navigation Rules,\n• custom design your practice tests by number, filter, and type so you can focus on what you need to learn,\n• rules are clearly identified as Inland and International or both,\n• all practice tests results are stored until manually deleted,\n• Canadian Modifications to the Navigation Rules."

      "label": "Boat Beacon is an internet AIS receiver and transmitter for your iPhone and iPad. It is the only AIS ship tracking app to provide Collision Warnings, share your boat’s position & use real-time AIS data.\n\nConnected to the largest network of AIS shore receivers world-wide covering most major ports, harbours and popular coastal areas.\n\n“An outstanding app, with great potential. Both interesting to use and very user friendly. This could be a life saver and especially of interest to small boat users. Everyone who goes on the water should have this on and use it!”  ***** Sun Dream, App Store Review\n\nBoat Beacon is specifically designed for boaters & provides continuous Bearing, Range & Closest Point of Approach (CPA) calculations and alarms in addition to standard AIS information even when in the background.\n\nBoat Beacon does not require any external AIS transponder or receiver equipment.\n\nKey Features\n------------\nOver-the-horizon collision avoidance (30 miles radius) using continuous CPA calculations - highlights boats that are on a potential collision course and alerts you with an alarm.\n\nContinually transmits and receives position information via the internet and calculates and alarms CPA even when the app is in the background.\n\nShares your position with Internet AIS Systems and apps and other Boat Beacon users in real time.\n\nReal time ship map view with North up and Heading up modes so you can look in the direction of the ships on the map to locate them.\n\nNav display showing own boat's speed, course, heading and position.\n\nMan Overboard tracking, SART Alarm, Anchor watch and Theft alarms.\n\nApple Watch App included\n\nExport tracks\n\nBoat-to-Boat & Boat-to-Group Messaging. \n\nLocal AIS and GPS via Wifi.\n\nBoat Beacon InApp Add-ons:-\n\nLiveView - Augmented Reality Camera view with ships, compass & horizon overlaid. Works with FLIROne Infra-red cameras as well to see ships & people in the dark & through fog (IAP)\n\n\"AIS Sharing\" to other apps like Navionics & iNavX (IAP subscription)\n\nUS, UK and IE Marine raster charts  (IAP).\n\nLet Friends and Family see where you are and where you're headed to with our free Boat Watch app or on web-based AIS systems like MarineTraffic which have free web viewers available.\n\nArm all the crews in a race with Boat Beacon and have real time updates on the race positions on the water and back in the club house.\n\nKeep a watch and in touch with other boats in your flotilla when sailing in a group.\n\nBoat Beacon requires internet access to work. Most popular coastal areas have cellular data access extending 12 or more miles out to sea. \n\nSubscriptions\nThe \"AIS Sharing \" subscription is monthly ($5.99) or yearly ($16.49), and will automatically renew at the end of the subscription period unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Payment will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase, and will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period. Subscriptions may be managed by the iTunes account holder and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to Account Settings after purchase.  No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during active subscription period.\n\nTerms of Use: http://seanav.net/termsofuse.php\n\nPrivacy Policy: http://seanav.net/privacy.php\n\nSupport: help@pocketmariner.com\n\nYour position can be shared and seen on all our apps without using an MMSI number. To be seen on Global AIS systems like MarineTraffic you will need an MMSI number. In the US you can obtain one  by visiting http://www.boatus.com/mmsi or email us for a free internet MMSI number.\n\nPlease note that continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nNOT FOR NAVIGATION\nBoat Beacon should only be used for basic navigation reference and should not be solely relied upon to determine precise locations, proximity, distance, or direction. You will not be visible to other ships on VHF only AIS systems."

      "label": "The legendary iOS compass app is now available for Apple Watch!  Pro Compass replicates the look and feel of classic pocket compass hardware in use since the 1800s.  The app uses advanced graphics technologies (normally reserved for games) to render 3D floating compass hardware for realistic operation.\n\nPro Compass offers true and magnetic compass modes using a damped rosette-style compass ring.  Local sun and moon position are shown on the compass ring and continually updated.  Pro Compass also displays location and altitude, with decimal and degree-minute-second formats.  The app contains a built-in two-axis inclinometer that drives two independent bubble levels and a bullseye level. \n\nNew in Pro Compass for Watch version 2 is a map screen and waypoint manager.  You can add waypoints on the map or at your current location, and view waypoints on the compass ring to visualize their bearing from your current location.\n\nPro Compass has settings for compass mode (true or magnetic), distance/altitude units (feet or meters), and position format (decimal degrees, degrees-minutes-seconds, MGRS, USNG, UTM, UTM-B, and Maidenhead Locator System).  The app has six color schemes, including two night vision modes - midnight red and luminescent green.\n\nPro Compass for Watch is recommended for Apple Watch Series 5 and later (including Ultra).  Apple Watch Series 4 and older do not have a compass sensor and will not show compass data.  On older devices, the app uses the device's gyro sensor to measure rotation.  You can twist the watch's digital crown to adjust and calibrate the gyro to the sun position, moon position, or a known bearing.  Using these references, the \"gyro compass\" is able to give bearing.  The calibration can be repeated as often as desired to give accurate results.\n\nAccuracy note: Pro Compass reports accuracy from the magnetometer sensor in your watch.  To improve results, operate Pro Compass away from magnets, electronics, or sources of electro-magnetic interference, including car dashboards, aircraft cockpits, metal structures, and other devices.\n\nDeveloper note: like all our apps, we plan to continually improve and evolve Pro Compass for Watch.  Please contact us with feature requests, suggestions, and general feedback.  We'd love to hear what you're doing with the app!"

      "label": "NEW: 5G maps & integrated speed testing!\n\nDirectly overlay and compare cellular carrier coverage maps! Perfect for travelers - research where you're covered across the USA (and now Canada!!) \n\n** Follow our Facebook page to get update alerts: http://www.facebook.com/CoverageMapApp, or check our support page**\n\nCoverage? focuses on helping mobile bandwidth junkies find cell signal as they roam.  Save time looking up coverage on the carrier's websites, compare their claims head to head and better plan your travels to stay connected. \n\n** The carrier's maps in your pocket: This app contains regional level maps based off of each major carrier's data map - as found on their website as of our last update. Quickly overlay the carriers you use to create your own personalized coverage map on your device. \n\n** No internet needed: Our proprietary coverage maps are stored within the app on your device - no downloading needed! Quickly access where you're supposed to get a signal, even when you have none. \n\n** Urban and rural areas: Maps are at a regional level, and cover the entire continental USA, Canada, Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands.\n\n** Carriers included: AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, US Cellular.\n** Canadian Carriers: Bell, Telus, Rogers (optional unlock)\n\n** Know where to roam: view 5G, LTE, and roaming areas as overlays, focus on finding the coverage type you desire. \n\nCheck http://www.twostepsbeyond.com/apps/coverage for a quick video demo.\n\nWe created this app because we are full time 'technomads' ourselves who rely on mobile data to work remotely. Keeping this app updated is a priority for us, as we depend on it ourselves!\n\n--------------\nCoverage FAQ: \nQ: Why aren't the maps more detailed or released more often? \nA: Our map updates require a lot of meticulous labor intensive processing. There's just no practical way to issue a new update every time a new tower is turned on. We monitor new coverage and try to find balance between effort & staying current.  This generally means at least a couple updates a year. \n\nQ: What makes 'Coverage?' unique? \nA: There are great apps out there that collect user submitted signal reports - we recommend them and use them ourselves. However, those apps are only useful in markets with an active user base. We took a different approach with Coverage? - we needed a tool to at least give us an idea of where signal should be - urban, rural, and out in the boonies.\n\n--------------\n\nNamed 'Essential Tool' by Wired Magazine\n\n** Winner - 'Most Useful App' - iOSDevCamp  \n\n\"this app can be indispensable\" - Lifehacker.com\n\n--------------\n\nThe maps in 'Coverage?' are provided in partnership with Ookla, and represent proprietary interpretations of the coverage reported by each carrier. You should not rely on the maps in Coverage to be perfectly precise or absolutely timely.  \n\nOngoing map updates have been free - but to support the ongoing development costs, we now allow customers to subscribe to higher resolution maps that will be updated more frequently. \n\nCoverage does not report or predict signal strength (there are great apps out there for that!). We can make no promises as to where you'll *actually* get signal.. there are too many variables - towers, device, terrain, weather, etc.\n\nSo… Got Coverage?\n\nAdditional information about The HD Maps Subscription:\n\nThis is an auto-renewable subscription, with a duration of one year. \n\nThe subscription fee will be charged to your iTunes account upon confirmation of purchase, and will automatically renew each year unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours prior to the end of the current subscription period.\n\nCurrent subscriptions may not be canceled during the active subscription period; however, you can manage your subscription and/or turn off auto-renewal by visiting your iTunes Account Settings after purchase.\n\nTerms of Use and Privacy Policy: http://www.twostepsbeyond.com/privacy/"

Le Zone a Traffico Limitato (ZTL) sono sorvegliate dai vigili urbani e protette da telecamere che controllano gli accessi. Alcune di esse sono in funzione 24 ore su 24, altre vengono aperte agli automobilisti solo per alcune ore al giorno.  Se per caso dovessi accedere in una di queste zone, saresti costretto a pagare una multa che va dagli 80,00 euro ai 335,00 euro. Lo sappiamo, ti sembrano cifre assurde ma in Italia le regole sono queste.\nNon preoccuparti più del dovuto, però!  Scarica ZTL Italia e parti sicuro e informato. \nQuest'app è l'unica che contiene una mappa aggiornata con tutte le ZTL d'Italia. Facilissima ed attendibile, funziona come un navigatore. Grazie ad un sistema di allarme personalizzato, ogni volta che ti avvicinerai ad una ZTL una voce ti avvertirà in tempo e ti dirà se la zona è aperta o chiusa. Puoi avere ZTL Italia anche nel centro notifica del tuo smartphone o Tablet perché include il widget. \n\nVisita l'Italia senza brutte sorprese, scarica ZTL Italia e buon viaggio!\n\n*** Ultimo aggiornamento varchi: 29 Marzo 2017 ***"

      "label": "BACKGROUND:\n\nBuilt from the ground up in the rugged mountains of eastern Afghanistan, Tactical NAV comes from the mind of a U.S. Army Field Artillery officer who had a vision of creating a low-cost and highly accurate tactical navigation platform built specifically for military service members.\n\nTactical NAV's journey began in the notorious Pech River Valley of Kunar Province, Afghanistan. \n\nU.S. Army Capt. Jonathan J. Springer, a Fire Support Officer with the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), began developing the tactical navigation platform following the memorial services for Spc. Blair D. Thompson and Spc. Jared C. Plunk, who were killed in action on June 25, 2010.\n\nAfter pitching the idea and being turned away by the Department of Defense on multiple occasions, Captain Springer remained resolute in his mission to continue developing Tactical NAV — even to this day. His ultimate goals were (and still are) to make a difference for other Soldiers and honor the men and women who were killed and wounded in battle.\n\nHe ended up using his life savings to continue moving forward with the Tactical NAV project, all with the ultimate hope of saving military lives and helping his fellow service members accomplish their mission at home and abroad.\n\nTactical NAV officially launched on the App Store on February 14, 2011.\n\nMISSION:\n\nTactical NAV's mission is to provide military service members with a low-cost, highly accurate, and exceedingly powerful mobile tactical navigational solution.\n\nVISION:\n\nOur vision is to assist and support our nation's service members with their mobile navigational needs and further enable them to operate and win during Multi-Domain Operations (MDO).\n\nBUILT FOR ACCURACY:\n\nTactical NAV's performance is on par with the AN/PSN-13 Defense Advanced GPS Receiver (DAGR), and it has the feedback to prove it.\n\nBOTTOM LINE:\n\nPurpose-built by Soldiers and created to save military lives, Tactical NAV was the very first MGRS-focused app on the App Store. It has proven to be effective across a multitude of environments all throughout the world.\n\nTactical NAV has been successfully evaluated against other software platforms and devices such as Nett Warrior, JCR, BFT, JBC-P, and ATAK. Its accuracy is within 1-to-3 meters of these officially approved systems issued by the Department of Defense.\n\nIAPs & SUBSCRIPTIONS: \n\nTactical NAV contains in-app purchases (IAPs) and subscriptions. Currently, tactical drawing mode is available as an in-app purchase, and offline mapping is also available to users as either a monthly or yearly subscription. All revenue generated from these features goes towards further developmental coding and updates, and a portion of all proceeds are donated to charities that specifically benefit disabled veterans.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n• A military-quality precision targeting platform\n• Purpose-built for the individual Soldier\n• Offline mapping capabilities (complete usage of the TACNAV platform with no emission of a cellular signal)\n• WGS 84 standard (MGRS, UTM, BNG, and USNG coordinates)\n• Tactical drawing mode (e.g., useful for Joint Fires planning, creating overlays, route planning, and so forth)\n• Waypoint plotting functionality with military graphics (per FM 1-02.2)\n• Compass \"FastLock\" function for capturing quick azimuths\n• Snap and save photographs onto the main map for intelligence purposes and AARs\n• Location, waypoint, and photo-sharing capabilities (via email and text)\n• One-button night mode function for low-light situations \n• \"Go to Grid\" option for intelligent pinpoint planning and drawing of overlays\n• Created and tested to ensure utmost accuracy and reliability \n• iOS native code built for austere and contested environments\n• And so much more!!!\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES:\n \nThe Department of Defense does not endorse Tactical NAV, nor should it be used in life-threatening or combat situations in place of a government-issued device."

      "label": "BlindSquare is pioneering accessible navigation both indoors and outdoors. Know where you are, know where you're going, travel with confidence.\n\nBlindSquare is a new solution that combines the latest technology to help the blind with their daily lives. It has been developed in collaboration with blind people and carefully field tested. You need either an iPhone or an iPad to get started. It also supports some additional accessories to enhance the experience. \n\nHow does it work? \n\nBlindSquare uses GPS and the compass to locate you. It then gathers information about the surrounding environment from FourSquare. BlindSquare has some unique algorithms to decide what information is the most relevant and then speaks it to you with high quality speech synthesis. \n“What's the most popular café within 200 meters radius? Where is the post office or the library?” \n\nYou can control BlindSquare also through voice commands. The Voice Command feature is a premium service requiring purchase of credits for continuous use.  Voice Command Credits are available as an in-app purchase on the App Store.\n\nUsing BlindSquare as a GPS solution:\n\nWhen you start the app, it will start telling you the interesting places and street crossings around you. By changing the radius, you can limit the area you are interested in. You can also search by search term or by category. You can select an interesting place from the search results and perform the following tasks:\n\n1) Get contact info (address, phone number) \n2) Open twitter feed or restaurant menu (if provided)\n3) Make a phone call\n4) Start tracking the place (BlindSquare will assist you by repeating the distance and the clock face direction)\n5) Start your favourite navigator for turn-by-turn instructions (TomTom, Navigon or Apple Maps)\n\nBlindSquare is aware of when you travel by car, bus or train and starts to report interesting places in front of you (for example, the next stops) and street crossings when you are passing them.\n\nYou can also save your own private places to iCloud so they will be found with your every device.\n\nUsing BlindSquare as a Foursquare client:\n\nIf you like to play Foursquare, you can do the following with BlindSquare:\n \n1) Get a list of nearby FourSquare venues\n2) When you are in a place, you can check in by shaking your device\n3) Do a check in with commenting and twitter/facebook sharing\n4) Correct the location of the place\n\nBlindSquare supports the following languages: English, Arabic, Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean (South Korea), Norwegian, Polish, Portugues, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish.\n\nVoiceOver usage is supported but it also includes higher quality additional speech synthesis by Acapela Text-To-Speech from Acapela Group.\n \nInstructions in English: https://www.blindsquare.com/user-guide/ and https://www.blindsquare.com/faq/\n\nPlease note: This app retrieves data in real time from Foursquare and Open Street Map. Use of a flat rate data plan is highly recommended.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nHaving only been released in May 2012, BlindSquare has already received several prizes and awards:\n\n - GSMA: Global Mobile Awards 2013, Best Mobile Health Product or Service\n - Apps4Finland 2012\n - OpenCities App Challenge 2012\n - The Finnish Information Processing Association: Best Product 2012\n\nPlease note: To use BlindSquare, your iCloud account has to be active so BlindSquare can access it to save your settings and places.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

      "label": "Pro Altimeter uses the high-fidelity barometric pressure sensor in iOS devices to measure and compute altitude.\n\nPro Altimeter has a dead simple interface.  Barometric altitude and GPS altitude are displayed in large easy to read numbers, showing units of both feet and meters, and giving realtime accuracy estimates from the hardware.  At bottom are calibration and display mode buttons. The display offers a highly-readable daytime mode with black digits on an LCD-green background, and a reversed night mode that is easy on the eyes in dark conditions. That's it!\n\nProper calibration is necessary to measure altitude from barometric pressure (this is why a pilot \"dials in\" the cockpit altimeter before taking off). Pro Altimeter offers four different methods for calibration -- choose the easiest and most convenient:\n\n1. Use GPS altitude.  This method correlates the measured local barometric pressure with the altitude measured by GPS. This method can be used when your device has a clear line of sight to the sky and a reliable GPS fix with good accuracy.\n\n2. Manually enter altitude.  This method correlates the measured local barometric pressure with known altitude from landmarks, elevation benchmarks, trail markers, topo maps, land surveys, etc.  Altitude can be entered in feet or meters.\n\n3. Manually enter pressure.  If you have a weather station, weather report, or METAR report with equivalent sea level pressure for a nearby location, this can be used to correlate local barometric pressure to altitude.  Pressure can be entered with units of inches Hg, kPa, or mb. \n\n4. Check local airports.  With the tap of a button, Pro Altimeter will locate the five closest airports within 100 miles (160km) of your present location anywhere in the world, and pull in METAR data.  From that list of five, pick the airport of your choice and Pro Altimeter will import pressure data for calibration.\n\nOnce calibrated, Pro Altimeter keeps track of the time since its last calibration.  Because weather and local barometric pressure change over time, the app will warn you when 6 hours have elapsed since the last calibration by flashing the \"CALIBRATE\" button.  You should calibrate as frequently as practical -- for example, on a hike, calibrate whenever you pass a trail marker or elevation benchmark.  But at a minimum, calibrate at least every 6 hours or whenever weather changes in your area.\n\nPro Altimeter is intended for iOS devices with a built-in barometric pressure sensor (iPhone 6 and later, iPad Air 2 and later, iPad mini 4 and later, and iPad Pro).  On older devices without a barometric pressure sensor, only GPS altitude and accuracy will be displayed.  \n\nIf you have an Apple Watch, check out the new Pro Altimeter for Watch and get all this same functionality on your wrist!"

      "label": "Celestial navigation has never been easier!  With ezAlmanacOne and a sextant you will be finding your fix like a pro in no time!\n\nezAlmanacOne is an evolution of the iPad version of ezAlmanac with the modern user interface used in the Windows 10 version of ezAlmanac.  All of the features of ezAlmanac plus new features including:\n\n- Universal app runs on iPad, iPhone, iPod touch, and the new MacBook with M1 processor.\n- Supports all device orientations.  All screens support zoom and pan.\n- Make bearing observations to perform compass checks.\n- Archive saved observations and restore observation data from an archive.\n- Includes quick start guide, usage examples, and other documentation to learn celestial navigation.\n- Print/Output Nautical Almanac pages, observation reports, and other app documentation.\n\nezAlmanacOne will help you perform celestial navigation exactly as it has been done for hundreds of years. It produces all Nautical Almanac (1960-2059) and Pub. 229 tables exactly as you are used to seeing them in the printed form.  All tables can be accessed directly for manual usage if you choose to do so.  Since they are produced by the software they support zooming and panning, and you can highlight in the tables to easily find the correct value to use.\n\nMost users, however, will prefer to let ezAlmanacOne do all of the work.  Simply enter the basic sight parameters, make and enter your observations, and ezAlmanacOne will do the rest.  It performs all of the steps to correct your observation, find GP of the object, do the sight reduction, and plot the LOP.  No steps are skipped and all details are shown.  Click where the LOPs cross in the plot and you have found your fix!\n\nBesides finding your fix, ezAlmanacOne is one of the best tools available to perform compass checks from a bearing observation of one of the navigational bodies. The compass check function supports checking up to 5 devices from a single bearing observation.  ezAlmanacOne will also create a report of your compass check that can be saved as a PDF file or printed for the ships records.\n\nCelestial navigation instructors love ezAlmanacOne because it does celestial navigation exactly as they teach it.  Values obtained from the Nautical Almanac and Pub. 229 are clearly identified with an icon of the book.  When you press the book icon you are taken to the page that has that value with the row, column and value highlighted.  Even when ezAlmanacOne is doing all the work, it can teach you how to do it manually using the books.\n\nFor manual celestial navigation you can generate and print Nautical Almanac pages to use as a backup on a passage.  You can even print the sight reduction forms and plotting sheets you will need.\n\nezAlmanacOne performs all astronomical calculations using the NOVAS 3.1 software from the US Naval Observatory (USNO) and a JPL ephemeris that covers the years 1960 through 2059.  It also implements WMM-2020, the latest World Magnetic Model software available from NOAA, to compute magnetic declination.  Since all calculations are performed in the software, ezAlmanacOne is fully functional with no dependency on the internet."

      "label": "HoldCalcPro calculates the precise headings and times required to perform the proper entry procedure, and holding pattern. A simple input page allows a pilot to quickly enter the hold data with the onscreen keyboard and selector buttons, without the need to direct attention away from other tasks. Press \"Calculate\" to update the answer screens: a \"Graph\" for an overhead view, a \"Text\" page listing all the steps for the entry and the holding pattern, and a \"PFD\" page allowing the pilot to see what the indications in the cockpit would look like while performing each step.\n    Once your hold has been calculated the graph view allows orienting the hold as it would be on a chart (North Up) or with the holding course toward the top of the screen. The graph view also includes a wind direction and speed indicator, a legend for a sense of scale, a North indicator, and the outbound heading and time required for the hold. A yellow, segmented line indicates the FAA's \"70° line\" for determining which entry procedure to use, and this line is drawn 1 NM to either side of the fix to help with the scale of the hold.\n    The text view plainly shows the required entry procedure, and EVERY heading needed to complete the entire entry and hold, as well as the time for each segment. No other holding pattern calculator gives you the exact headings and times to fly for the entry procedure - there is no guesswork involved in getting you to line up with the inbound course exactly as you roll out of your turn.\n    The PFD view allows the pilot to see what the indications will look like when the procedure is executed properly, helping instrument students compare the procedure to the instrument readings, and enhancing the development of situational awareness.\n    Compare different views side-by-side (2 views on iPhone in landscape, and 3 views simultaneously on iPad) and use the playback controls to go through the hold second-by-second. The entry and hold are divided into segments, and as you move through the procedure (with the Play, Next, and Prev buttons) the graph view, text view, and PFD view show a synchronized movement through every second. This is the ultimate in building the visualization required for instrument flying, as the overhead view clearly shows where the plane is, as the PFD shows CDI movements, RMI needles, DME readout, and each segment can be played, and replayed. To get a quick preview of the entire hold, set the playback speed to 8X, and the playback to \"Auto\", and the entire procedure will sequence itself.\n    For the seasoned professional pilot, the \"answer\" you want is in the upper-left corner of the graph view. No more adjusting the outbound time or heading to eventually get the \"perfect\" roll out on the inbound. Just do it the first time.\n    This app is a must-have for instrument flight instructors hoping to help their instrument students develop the ability to turn holding instructions into action.\n    The entry steps alone can help you perform flawless procedure turns that join the final approach course as you roll out on the required heading to track the final!\n    While holding patterns are not usually done for entertainment, why increase your workload while there are more important things to consider (like: Where is the weather good? How long can I spend in this hold before \"Bingo\"? and, Are there alternates I've yet to consider?) Make your instrument flying more comfortable and enjoyable by giving yourself the opportunity to manage your flight, rather than play \"guess-and-check\" bracketing your outbound course and time."

Your phone got you to the zoo, now use it to show you around once you’re inside!\n\nGet instant directions to animals, restaurants, rides and attractions, bathrooms and water fountains. Our interactive map guides you to where you want to go. Don’t use those paper maps, they are not eco-friendly and they are difficult to read - \nOur mapping works even if you don't have a signal (web-based maps can't do that). \n \nZooMap is not affiliated with the Jacksonville Zoo, but we love zoos and what they do for the community. When our CEO saw people enter the zoo and rush to a poorly executed wall map or try to navigate using outdated paper maps that are wasteful and not very eco-friendly.  He knew we could help. Our goal is to increase your fun, while saving your time (and trees).\n \nTap on screen icons, use the search bar or open main menu to find animals, food, rides and attractions – even bathrooms and water fountains on those hot days. Soon, you will be able to receive notifications concerning feeding times, ride closures or any other up to the minute information you need to have the best time possible in the zoo. \n\nZooMap Features\n\nSAVE PARKING SPACE\n-\tUpon arrival you can save your parking location and BetterMaps will bring you right back to where you parked at the end of the day.\n\nGET TO KNOW THE ANIMALS\n-\tUse our menus to see pics, learn about the animals; then get mapped right to them.\n\nGET DIRECTIONS VIRTUALLY ANYWHERE IN THE ZOO\n-\tFind Animals, Exhibits, Rides, Restaurant and shopping, then click the MapMe walker icon. You will see how far and approximate time to walk there. Click Go and our live map will bring you to your destination. Veer off course and BetterMaps will adapt in real time. \n\nBE IN THE KNOW (ONLY IF ZOO PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION)\n-\tReceive notifications updating you on ride and animal closures\n-\tReceive discounts from surrounding businesses\n\nFOR BUSINESS OWNERS: MALLS, ZOOS, PARKS, MUNICIPALITIES, AMUSEMENT\nBetterMaps takes maps to a whole new level – the micro-level. We create maps for smaller spaces, such as zoos, amusement parks, cemeteries and even municipalities and outdoor malls.

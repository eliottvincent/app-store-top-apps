As with the other platforms, the iOS map includes an index to more than 1,000 backcountry locations in Utah’s Central Wasatch mountains. It is the must-have app for Utah hikers and backcountry travelers. \n\nWith a familiar map-app interface, the Wasatch Backcountry Skiing Map accesses your device’s GPS to display your current location on a high-resolution topo map. And with only a few taps, the “destination arrow” on the integrated compass will point to your desired backcountry ski location.\n\nAnd with a single tap, hundreds of the locations will open the Wasatch Backcountry Skiing Guide website where you can view photographs and detailed information about the location.\n\nThe app also displays your current elevation and lat/long, and will send your current location via email. And with a tap, you can display detailed information on more than 200 of the locations including skiing difficulty, skinning distance, vertical climb, parking considerations, and more.\n\n(Contrary to a posted review, you don't need cell service to use this app--you don't even need a contract with a cell service provider.)\n\nNOTICES: When navigating, the “destination arrow” points directly to the destination without regard to hazards such as avalanche paths, cliffs, and rock fall. It is your responsibility to travel in the backcountry safely."

      "label": "Welcome to the BetterMaps ZooMap app, Cincinnati Zoo version. \n\nSimple, fast and fun. Our app makes everyone’s day at the zoo better. Your phone got you to the zoo, now use it to show you around once you’re inside!\n\nGet instant directions to animals, restaurants, rides and attractions, bathrooms and water fountains. Our interactive map guides you to where you want to go. Don’t use those paper maps, they are not eco-friendly and they are difficult to read - \nOur mapping works even if you don't have a signal (web-based maps can't do that). \n \nZooMap is not affiliated with the Cincinnati Zoo, but we love zoos and what they do for the community. When our CEO saw people enter the zoo and rush to a poorly executed wall map or try to navigate using outdated paper maps that are wasteful and not very eco-friendly.  He knew we could help. Our goal is to increase your fun, while saving your time (and trees).\n \nTap on screen icons, use the search bar or open main menu to find animals, food, rides and attractions – even bathrooms and water fountains on those hot days. Soon, you will be able to receive notifications concerning feeding times, ride closures or any other up to the minute information you need to have the best time possible in the zoo. \n\nZooMap Features\n\nSAVE PARKING SPACE\n-\tUpon arrival you can save your parking location and BetterMaps will bring you right back to where you parked at the end of the day.\n\nGET TO KNOW THE ANIMALS\n-\tUse our menus to see pics, learn about the animals; then get mapped right to them.\n\nGET DIRECTIONS VIRTUALLY ANYWHERE IN THE ZOO\n-\tFind Animals, Exhibits, Rides, Restaurant and shopping, then click the MapMe walker icon. You will see how far and approximate time to walk there. Click Go and our live map will bring you to your destination. Veer off course and BetterMaps will adapt in real time. \n\nBE IN THE KNOW (ONLY IF ZOO PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION)\n-\tReceive notifications updating you on ride and animal closures\n-\tReceive discounts from surrounding businesses\n\nFOR BUSINESS OWNERS: MALLS, ZOOS, PARKS, MUNICIPALITIES, AMUSEMENT\nBetterMaps takes maps to a whole new level – the micro-level. We create maps for smaller spaces, such as zoos, amusement parks, cemeteries and even municipalities and outdoor malls. Use Google or Apple Maps to get you there, use BetterMaps to get around. check out our website: www.bettermaps.app"

      "label": "2022-2023 Season New York State Snowmobile Association (NYSSA) Mobile App\r\n\r\nHelp support snowmobiling in New York State by purchasing the New York State Snowmobile Association (NYSSA) Mobile App! A portion of the proceeds go to NYSSA to promote snowmobiling and other snowmobile club projects in New York State.\r\n\r\nThe NYSSA mobile app brings current snowmobile trail information and points of interest into live online and OFFLINE map capabilities. This is far from a static map as NYSSA’s 200+ clubs have LIVE access to update trail status as well as add warnings, reroutes and points of interest through their administrative access. Clubs also have access to add their own local trails, with new trails being added and updated regularly.\r\n\r\nSome of the highlights of the app:\r\n\r\n-Choose between both online (live updates) and OFFLINE maps. Offline maps updates are available daily.\r\n-See your current location and heading, allowing the app to follow your location.\r\n-Breadcrumb tracking of current location and new navigation mode.\r\n-View current trail status (open, closed, unreported), closures, and reroutes\r\n-Find fuel, food, lodging, parking and ride locations, parts and service, and scenic or points of interest recommended by NYSSA and clubs.\r\n-Click on trails or points of interest to see more information\r\n-Measure distances and areas\r\n-Choose between multiple basemaps including imagery\r\n-Search for locations and address\r\n-Toggle layers on and off\r\nPlease contact us (email link within the app) with suggestions for future updates. We look forward to working with the snowmobile community in our future development efforts!\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n*Trail status, reroutes, and related points are maintained by the clubs and may not always be accurate.\r\n**Continued use of GPS will quickly drain battery life. It is recommended to turn off GPS when not required or plug into a power source during extended use.\r\n***This purchase is for the 2022-2023 season. The app will continue to work through October 2023, and will time out on November 1st, 2023. Another purchase is required for the 2023-2024 season***"

      "label": "Theodolite is a multi-function viewfinder that combines a compass, two-axis inclinometer, rangefinder, GPS, map, nav calculator, and geo-overlay photo/movie camera into one indispensable app. Theodolite was one of the very first augmented reality (AR) apps when it was released in 2009, and it’s been downloaded and used by millions of customers since then. Uses are endless, and the app is great for land measurements, outdoor sports, sightseeing, navigation, and finding your way around. Theodolite is a pro grade app and is used extensively by surveyors, geologists, architects, engineers, competitive sportsmen, first responders, military personnel, and search and rescue workers around the world. \n\nTheodolite lets you take data-overlay photos and movies with 2X-8X zoom. Overlay geographical data, angle markings, date/time, author/company info, and project notes directly on photos and movies for later reference. The same data is written into the metadata record of images, making image files self-contained data records. Third-party apps can tap into Theodolite's advanced camera functions with a camera sharing feature.\n\nView current position on the built-in map with optional offline Outdoors maps that include topo contours, roads, trails, landmarks, campgrounds, ski lifts, and more. Live map markers continually update distance/heading relative to the current location and also show wayfinding info in the main viewfinder. Draw polygons on the map to mark things like property boundaries and trails, and import/export polygon data via KML.\n\nShare map markers and nav calculator points with other users of Theodolite via text messages or e-mail. This powerful capability opens up a wide range of collaborative uses including team land surveying, accident investigations, spotting wild fires, triangulation of landmarks, and advanced tactical observation and targeting. With an optional in-app purchase to enable team tracking, you can share location with up to 20 people on Theodolite's map.\n\nTheodolite includes features for serious users like a reference angle mode, nav calculator, map marker import/export, manual and automatic data logging with CSV and KML export, clipboard integration, %grade display, mil compass readout, optical rangefinders (including a mil-based reticle, sniper-style stadiametric graphs, and a variable 4X-24X scope), and night filters to improve use in dark conditions.\n\nTheodolite can provide location in military grid reference system (MGRS) coordinates, Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates, British/Irish National Grids, US National Grid, Maidenhead locator system, Map Grid of Australia, and six latitude/longitude formats. Optional US State Plane coordinates include SPCS27 and SPCS83 zones covering all US States. The optional Datum Pack adds over 230 geodetic datums to the app to improve position computation from GPS data, covering regions and countries on all continents around the world.\n\nAR Layers include navigational aids like the sun, moon, planets, and Polaris (North star), and the optional US Mountain Summits layer that shows over 70,000 US mountain summits in the viewfinder.\n\nTheodolite has been shown in Apple Keynotes, featured on the App Store, and has been a #1 selling Navigation app in App Stores around the world. Since its introduction in 2009, Theodolite has defined augmented reality navigation. The app continually introduces new technologies, pushing the limits of iOS app development and taking advantage of new hardware capabilities.\n\nFind out why Apple named Theodolite one of the most amazing apps available and showed it being used to explore the Great Wall of China. Where will you take it on your next adventure?\n\nNote: Theodolite is an iPhone app -- see “Theodolite HD” for use on an iPad. And be sure to check out the all-new \"Theodolite for Watch\" and put Theodolite on your wrist!"

      "label": "A high quality Speedometer, GPS tracker and trip cost monitor for iPhones and cellular iPads. \n∙∙ When you go over a preset speed limit, the large digits change colour from green to red and the device emits a loud sound to alert you! \n∙∙ The cost monitor shows you the current cost of the journey as you drive and tells you each passengers share. \n∙∙ GPS tracker records your trips so they can be analyzed, viewed and shared at any moment.\n\n‣‣ COST MONITOR. What's the cost of my driving?\nBased on gas price for a gallon or litre, MPG (U.S. or UK) or liters per 100 km the app will tell you what the cost is as you drive. You can add an extra cost per kilometer or mile! Useful for all cost aware drivers and for splitting the cost between passengers.\n\n‣‣ GPS TRACKING. Where I've been? How long did it take to get from A to B? \nSpeedometer records your trip statistics even when GPS tracker is switched off. When you need point by point data to see on the map later or export (Google Earth and GPX), speedometer gives you the first class GPS tracker.\n\n‣‣ INFOTAINMENT. \nWhen switched on, infotainment shows trip stats or weather/wind forecast  when you wait. Way better than just showing you a 0 speed!\n\n‣‣ Easy to set speed limits and SPEED LIMIT MEMORY option\nSet speed limits with 4 or 8 fast and configurable presets. Presets only need a single tap and are the safest way to set the limits! With SPEED LIMIT MEMORY you just apply the speed limit once and the app applies it for you automatically the next time!\n\n‣‣ MODES\nUse MENU>MODES to turn the app into a Rally computer, G-Force monitor, Camera alerter or taximeter! Currently there are 12 modes available and we are constantly adding new ones.\n\n‣‣ WAYPOINTS.\nSpeedometer gives you the unique way to leave a note with location and even optional photo or audio note attached! As easy as double tap on the big speed digits! You'll find more in a documentation section (star button).\n\n‣‣ RED LIGHT & SPEED CAMERAS\nImport camera data into speedometer in Garmin or iGO csv formats from poi-factory.com, scdb.info or poi-plaza and let speedo alert you on a camera approach and set speed limit automatically before you pass the speed camera!\n\n‣‣ SUNSET/SUNRISE\nWith the sunset and sunrise information that our speedometer provides, you'll be able to avoid driving in the dusk.\n\n‣‣ BARO VSI. Barometric Vertical Speed Indicator (VSI, IVSI) in both scale and graph forms.\n\n‣‣ VOICE COACH. When enabled and configured, voice coach will be telling you active track distance and duration as well as current speed and altitude.\n\n‣‣ MAPS. Google's native, Apple map, Blank map and Offline maps.\n\n‣‣ Siri shortcuts: New Track, Stop Track, Speed limits.\n\n+ UNIVERSAL APP. Speedometer for iPhone and cellular iPads. All in retina graphics.\n\n+ 000-999 SPEED AND LIMIT RANGE. MPH, KM/H AND KNOTS. Maximum/TOP, average speed, distance traveled.\n\n+ BACKGROUND MODE! Speedometer will work in background if told so and will still warn you with audio alert when exceed a preset speed limit. You can use other apps while speedometer does its job in the background!\n\n+ PRIVACY. Speedometer never shares your location data with 3rd parties or ad agencies. Location data is used solely for tracking your speed and recording the GPS tracks and never leave the app unless you decide to share by means of a track export. It always let you know when background mode is on and never runs in background unless it is explicitly told to do so.\n\n! You can use this app on your iPhone as well as on any cellular iPad. **App will not work properly on iPods and wifi only iPads as they don't have GPS (external GPS module is required). \n! Please note that as with all GPS apps, continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nDrive safely, keep the log and notes and avoid paying those speeding fines! Our speedometer is the ideal companion no matter what journey you are going on!"

      "label": "Theodolite was one of the earliest augmented reality (AR) apps for iOS when it debuted in 2009 -- in fact Theodolite was pioneering AR technology before \"AR\" was even a buzzword! In the time since, Theodolite has been used by millions of consumers and professionals in their outdoor adventures and on the job. Now, we've taken the Theodolite concept to Apple Watch by combining a compass, inclinometer, GPS, and maps into one indispensable app that sits on your wrist. We're excited to keep evolving this centuries-old instrument as hardware and software technologies allow the concept to come to new device formats.\n\nOn iPhone and iPad, Theodolite uses a viewfinder format, uniting the device sensors (GPS, magnetometer, gyro, accelerometer) and camera.  On Apple Watch, Theodolite combines data from these sensors into an AHRS (attitude and heading reference system) layout similar to what you'd see in the glass cockpit of a modern aircraft. This layout allows Theodolite to efficiently display compass bearing (yaw angle), pitch angle, and roll angle in a compact format that works extremely well on a small screen.  This information is augmented by latitude, longitude, and altitude from GPS, as well as sun and moon position.\n\nNew in Theodolite for Watch version 2 is a map screen and waypoint manager.  You can add waypoints on the map or at your current location, and view waypoints on the compass ring to visualize their bearing from your current location.\n\nTheodolite has settings for compass mode (true or magnetic), distance/altitude units (feet or meters), and position format (decimal degrees, degrees-minutes-seconds, MGRS, USNG, UTM, UTM-B, and Maidenhead Locator System).  Users can choose to display an artificial horizon in the center of the app display (tied to pitch and roll) and can set the app's level reference to flat or vertical orientations of the Watch.  The app has six color schemes, including two night vision modes - midnight red and luminescent green.\n\nTheodolite for Watch is recommended for Apple Watch Series 5 and later (including Ultra).  Apple Watch Series 4 and older do not have a compass sensor and will not show compass data.  On older devices, the app uses the device's gyro sensor to measure rotation.  You can twist the watch's digital crown to adjust and calibrate the gyro to the sun position, moon position, or a known bearing.  Using these references, the \"gyro compass\" is able to give bearing.  The calibration can be repeated as often as desired to give accurate results.\n\nTheodolite reports accuracy from the magnetometer sensor in your Watch.  To improve results, operate Theodolite away from magnets, electronics, or sources of electro-magnetic interference, including car dashboards, aircraft cockpits, metal structures, and other devices.\n\nLike all our apps, we plan to continually improve and evolve Theodolite for Watch.  Please contact us with feature requests, suggestions, and general feedback.  We'd love to hear what you're doing with the app!  And if you don't already have Theodolite for your iPhone or iPad, check it out!"

The data is up to date as of Summer, 2022, and contains over 53,000 recreational points and other features on BLM land. These points are symbolized with several color-coded icons that differentiate between the . Categories include Access Points, Boating, Campgrounds, POIs, Vistas, Bathrooms, Parking Lots, Recreational Areas, and much more! The app even distinguishes property boundaries and includes some hiking trails and roads.\n\nNew in this release! We listened to your requests and have added several improvements and new features including a custom My Points tool! Now you can save your own points of interest and give them a unique color and icon. Mark where you park the car, where you saw a neat feature, or an epic campsite. You can even export these points for use with other devices!\n\nOnce using the app, there are five screens. The Guide screen will provide data legends as well as helpful tips for optimizing your navigational experience. On the Info screen, you will find a number of spatial links to the different BLM properties. This is a great way to quickly locate specific places and discover new places to explore! The About screen provides links to all of the open-source resources used in the app and gives a little information about the developer GeoPOI. The Map Settings screen is where you can change between one of four different basemaps, download offline imagery, turn on geolocation, and toggle specific point categories. Finally, the Map screen is where it all comes together!\n\nOn the Map screen, there are a series of circle clusters at distant zooms that indicate how many points are within a given cluster. As you tap the clusters to zoom in, individual points and icons become visible, along with trails, roads, and boundaries. These features can be clicked on to reveal the name, location, and other useful information. The map screen also has two search tools - the left one can be used to look up addresses and towns, while the right one will allow you to query the names of the features in the database.\n\nThere is such a wealth of beauty out there waiting to be discovered. Never before has it been this easy to navigate our public lands as you travel, no matter where in the United States you are or what kinds of places you are interested in visiting. It's time to experience the rich natural and cultural tapestry of our nation and pay homage to the places that make our country the great land that it is. Come navigate the US BLM lands with GeoPOI today!"

An E6B is also used to calculate data used for performance planning such as density altitude.

Watch in full screen, view in AR, search, add filters and so much more!\n\nShip Finder has been top rated and top ranking since 2009 and covers most of the world, tracking 20,000+ ships simultaneously.\n\nOur incredible app performance means that you can see all tracked vessels at once - no clustering here!\nSimply tap a ship to see its name, type, photos, speed, dimensions and much more.\nPowerful features such as filters, search and the ability to save favourite ships are included. (You can choose Apple or Google maps too!).\n\nAdd and browse bookmarks to saved locations around the globe to quickly navigate to areas or ports of interest.\n\nYou can even use Augmented Reality (AR) view to identify ships out at sea using your device camera. \n\nShip Finder works by picking up AIS ship feeds used by all passenger vessels, vessels over 300 tons and increasingly by smaller pleasure craft and yachts. This technology is actually faster than radar and is used by vessels for safety and navigation.\n\nShip Finder provides near real time “virtual radar” AIS maps. It’s easy to use and is an amazing app for anyone interested in shipping, cruising and sailing in ports and locations across the world. It’s also great if you simply want to know what boats are out there or want to see where your friends and family are. Ship Finder is also used extensively by maritime professionals and mariners.\n\nOur global AIS coverage is impressive and expanding all of the time as we add new AIS feeds and receivers. Please check www.shipfinder.co regularly to see the latest coverage.\n\nPinkfroot are committed to customer service and continually improve our Ship Finder apps based on feedback.

      "label": "BACKGROUND:\n\nBuilt from the ground up in the rugged mountains of eastern Afghanistan, Tactical NAV comes from the mind of a U.S. Army Field Artillery officer who had a vision of creating a low-cost and highly accurate tactical navigation platform built specifically for military service members.\n\nTactical NAV's journey began in the notorious Pech River Valley of Kunar Province, Afghanistan. \n\nU.S. Army Capt. Jonathan J. Springer, a Fire Support Officer with the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), began developing the tactical navigation platform following the memorial services for Spc. Blair D. Thompson and Spc. Jared C. Plunk, who were killed in action on June 25, 2010.\n\nAfter pitching the idea and being turned away by the Department of Defense on multiple occasions, Captain Springer remained resolute in his mission to continue developing Tactical NAV — even to this day. His ultimate goals were (and still are) to make a difference for other Soldiers and honor the men and women who were killed and wounded in battle.\n\nHe ended up using his life savings to continue moving forward with the Tactical NAV project, all with the ultimate hope of saving military lives and helping his fellow service members accomplish their mission at home and abroad.\n\nTactical NAV officially launched on the App Store on February 14, 2011.\n\nMISSION:\n\nTactical NAV's mission is to provide military service members with a low-cost, highly accurate, and exceedingly powerful mobile tactical navigational solution.\n\nVISION:\n\nOur vision is to assist and support our nation's service members with their mobile navigational needs and further enable them to operate and win during Multi-Domain Operations (MDO).\n\nBUILT FOR ACCURACY:\n\nTactical NAV's performance is on par with the AN/PSN-13 Defense Advanced GPS Receiver (DAGR), and it has the feedback to prove it.\n\nBOTTOM LINE:\n\nPurpose-built by Soldiers and created to save military lives, Tactical NAV was the very first MGRS-focused app on the App Store. It has proven to be effective across a multitude of environments all throughout the world.\n\nTactical NAV has been successfully evaluated against other software platforms and devices such as Nett Warrior, JCR, BFT, JBC-P, and ATAK. Its accuracy is within 1-to-3 meters of these officially approved systems issued by the Department of Defense.\n\nIAPs & SUBSCRIPTIONS: \n\nTactical NAV contains in-app purchases (IAPs) and subscriptions. Currently, tactical drawing mode is available as an in-app purchase, and offline mapping is also available to users as either a monthly or yearly subscription. All revenue generated from these features goes towards further developmental coding and updates, and a portion of all proceeds are donated to charities that specifically benefit disabled veterans.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n• A military-quality precision targeting platform\n• Purpose-built for the individual Soldier\n• Offline mapping capabilities (complete usage of the TACNAV platform with no emission of a cellular signal)\n• WGS 84 standard (MGRS, UTM, BNG, and USNG coordinates)\n• Tactical drawing mode (e.g., useful for Joint Fires planning, creating overlays, route planning, and so forth)\n• Waypoint plotting functionality with military graphics (per FM 1-02.2)\n• Compass \"FastLock\" function for capturing quick azimuths\n• Snap and save photographs onto the main map for intelligence purposes and AARs\n• Location, waypoint, and photo-sharing capabilities (via email and text)\n• One-button night mode function for low-light situations \n• \"Go to Grid\" option for intelligent pinpoint planning and drawing of overlays\n• Created and tested to ensure utmost accuracy and reliability \n• iOS native code built for austere and contested environments\n• And so much more!!!\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES:\n \nThe Department of Defense does not endorse Tactical NAV, nor should it be used in life-threatening or combat situations in place of a government-issued device."

      "label": "Welcome to the BetterMaps ZooMap app, Bronx Zoo version. Our custom interactive map plans the shortest route to your destination. Our mapping works even if you don't have a signal (web-based maps can't do that). Find animals, rides & attractions, food and more and our map will guide you to your destination. Get food (or a beer) and find the bathrooms when you're done (quickly!) Walk around knowing you don't have to remember where you parked (we do that for you - then bring you back to the car at the end of a long day). So have fun and get mapped. Free! - other zoos coming soon. \n \nZooMap is not affiliated with the Bronx Zoo but we are a New York company (located in Brooklyn), and we LOVE the Bronx Zoo. When our CEO saw people enter the zoo and rush to a poorly executed wall map or try to navigate using an outdated paper map (uh, save the planet much?) he knew we could help. Our goal is to increase your fun, while saving your time (and trees).\n\nThe BetterMaps ZooMap, Bronx Zoo version truly is the best way to explore the Bronx Zoo (more zoos are coming online very soon) without missing anything that you and/or the family want to see during your visit. The ZooMap digital guide brings you a whole new level of closeness to everything the Bronx Zoo has to offer. Once you have found what you are looking for, our custom algorithm shows you route overview, how away you are, and approximate time to walk there. Simply hit Go and just follow the blue line to get there. Our flashlight points you in the right direction (use your phone as a wayfinder). Veer off the path, no problem, our map adapts to your movements and reroutes instantly.  \n\nTap onscreen icons, use the search bar or drop down menu to find animals, food, rides and attractions – even bathrooms and water fountains on those hot days. Soon you will be able to receive notifications concerning feeding times, ride closures or any other up to the minute information you need to have the best time possible in the zoo.  \n\nZooMap Features\n\nSAVE PARKING SPACE\n-\tUpon arrival you can save your parking location and BetterMaps will bring you right back to where you parked at the end of the day – no more having to use your door lock fob to find your car beeping in the distance.\n\nGET TO KNOW THE ANIMALS\n-\tUse our menus to learn about the animals, species and where they are from.\n\nGET DIRECTIONS VIRTUALLY ANYWHERE IN THE ZOO\n-\tFind Animals, Exhibits, Rides, Restaurant and shopping, then click the MapMe walker icon. You will see how far and approximate time to walk there. Click Go and our live map will bring you to your destination. Veer off course and BetterMaps will adapt in real time. \n\nBE IN THE KNOW\n-\tReceive notifications updating you on ride and animal closures\n-\tReceive discounts from surrounding businesses\n\nFOR BUSINESS OWNERS: MALLS, ZOOS, PARKS, MUNICIPALITIES, AMUSEMENT\nBetterMaps takes maps to a whole new level – the micro-level. We create maps for smaller spaces, such as zoos, amusement parks, cemeteries and even municipalities and outdoor malls. Use Google or Apple Maps to get you there, use BetterMaps to get around. check out our website: www.bettermaps.app\n\nBut we do more than just help you visitors navigate, we provide communications as well – send out the latest news and updates, tell your visitors what’s going on before they arrive.\n\nGet information into the hands of your customers: food and drink specials, shopping deals, popup sales and other updates to make their day more rewarding and keep them coming back."

      "label": "Save time and money on your instrument flight training by mastering IFR holding pattern entries at the comfort of your own mobile device.\n\nMake IFR flight training easier!\n\nIs the following scenario familiar? You receive a holding clearance from ATC, and only have a couple of minutes, sometimes only a few seconds, to choose the correct entry. By the time you've figured out what's going on, you've already passed the holding fix and don't know what to do next.\n\nIf this sounds familiar, then you need not to worry. Confusion during holding entries happens to practically almost every new instrument student. Even instrument-rated pilots occasionally have the same problem — when they don't get enough practice.\n\nHolding Trainer solves this problem and as a result, cuts the time you have to spend on expensive flight and ground lessons. With Holding Trainer, you can practice on your own time and convenience, so that choosing the best holding entry in the air becomes a breeze. \n\n\nFeatures: \n\n-Entry Trainer - Drills you on choosing the best holding entry. Practice until choosing holding entries becomes second nature and impress your flight instructor with your skills.\n\n-Holding calculator. Solve and visualize any holding scenario by entering your current bearing to the fix and a outbound or inbound holding radial. \n\n-Holding tutorial - learn how to choose the best holding entry quickly and easily.\n\nHolding Trainer for iOS is a complete rewrite based on my popular Flash-based desktop Holding Trainer app available on pilotscafe.com.\n\n***Don't get \"stuck\" next time you receive a holding pattern clearance!***\n----------------------------------\nFor only a fraction of the cost of one ground lesson with your flight instructor, you can practice this important instrument skill at your own pace and save hundreds of Dollars on figuring out holding entries in the air.\n\nThis is a great tool for anyone training towards their instrument checkride, CFII, proficiency check, or simply trying to improve their holding patterns.\n----------------------------------"

      "label": "The legendary iOS compass app is now available for Apple Watch!  Pro Compass replicates the look and feel of classic pocket compass hardware in use since the 1800s.  The app uses advanced graphics technologies (normally reserved for games) to render 3D floating compass hardware for realistic operation.\n\nPro Compass offers true and magnetic compass modes using a damped rosette-style compass ring.  Local sun and moon position are shown on the compass ring and continually updated.  Pro Compass also displays location and altitude, with decimal and degree-minute-second formats.  The app contains a built-in two-axis inclinometer that drives two independent bubble levels and a bullseye level. \n\nNew in Pro Compass for Watch version 2 is a map screen and waypoint manager.  You can add waypoints on the map or at your current location, and view waypoints on the compass ring to visualize their bearing from your current location.\n\nPro Compass has settings for compass mode (true or magnetic), distance/altitude units (feet or meters), and position format (decimal degrees, degrees-minutes-seconds, MGRS, USNG, UTM, UTM-B, and Maidenhead Locator System).  The app has six color schemes, including two night vision modes - midnight red and luminescent green.\n\nPro Compass for Watch is recommended for Apple Watch Series 5 and later (including Ultra).  Apple Watch Series 4 and older do not have a compass sensor and will not show compass data.  On older devices, the app uses the device's gyro sensor to measure rotation.  You can twist the watch's digital crown to adjust and calibrate the gyro to the sun position, moon position, or a known bearing.  Using these references, the \"gyro compass\" is able to give bearing.  The calibration can be repeated as often as desired to give accurate results.\n\nAccuracy note: Pro Compass reports accuracy from the magnetometer sensor in your watch.  To improve results, operate Pro Compass away from magnets, electronics, or sources of electro-magnetic interference, including car dashboards, aircraft cockpits, metal structures, and other devices.\n\nDeveloper note: like all our apps, we plan to continually improve and evolve Pro Compass for Watch.  Please contact us with feature requests, suggestions, and general feedback.  We'd love to hear what you're doing with the app!"

      "label": "Congratulations, you have found the finest and most advanced Holding Pattern Computer available.\n\nThis app's primary goal is to provide the specific headings and timings needed to fly a holding pattern whereby the Pilot will roll out precisely onto the inbound leg exactly 1-minute, or other user-defined time or length, from the fix.\n\nThe app is ideal for less seasoned Pilots and those training for their instrument rating and is an excellent cross-check for more experienced Pilots. It helps you remain mentally oriented to the aircraft's relative position to the pattern, magnetic north, and wind effects.\n\nWhereas other holding pattern devices suggest an appropriate entry procedure such as direct, parallel, or teardrop, this Holding Pattern Computer takes it a step further. It provides turn-by-turn directions, including how long to fly a heading before initiating a turn- not only standard rate turns with bank limitations (30° manual flying and 25° with a Flight Director) but arbitrary turn rates too!\n\nThis Holding Pattern Computer employs a sophisticated, patented analytic solution developed by a 51-year Aerospace Industry veteran and FAA Safety Team Representative Les Glatt, Ph.D. ATP/CFI-AI, AGI/IGI. It automatically calculates ground track, wind correction angle, headings, and required timings, given the assigned fix, true airspeed, and virtually any wind direction and velocity up to 99.99% of TAS. \n\nThere are no other applications, including existing aircraft avionics, that is as accurate as this app. And since we measure the outbound time from the point the aircraft turns to the outbound heading, it is no longer necessary to locate the abeam point. How's that for reducing Pilot workload!\n\nThis app takes a step-by-step approach when entering holding data, using individual screens for each component, making it easier to focus on one element at a time while continuing to fly the airplane.\n\nWe've also included an onboard user guide and the seminal paper: \"A Treatise on the Holding Pattern: Expelling the Myths and Misconceptions of Timing and Wind Correction.\"\n\nFor less than the cost of one hour with a flight instructor, you're getting the most advanced Holding Pattern Computer available and the information needed to help you master and fly the perfect holding pattern every time!\n\nIf you want that perfectly timed inbound leg while rolling out precisely on to the inbound course, then this app is for you!\n\nTo learn more, visit https://HoldingPattern.com"

Great without cellular connection as well, which makes it all the more useful in the backcountry and far away from ASOS/AWOS stations.\n\n* Location Search: Find atmospheric data (Density Altitude, etc.) at any point on Earth, from anywhere!\n\nData Sensed and Calculated (all calculated with humidity):\n\n* Density Altitude \n* GPS Altitude\n* Temperature\n* Altimeter Setting\n* Absolute Pressure\n* Dew Point\n* Relative Humidity\n* Specific Humidity (grains/pound)\n* Air Density\n* Relative Air Density (RAD)\n* Dyno Correction\n\nThe quickest way to get your Density Altitude! On the iPhone 6/6+ and newer iPads, it will use the built-in barometer and GPS. If you're in cell range, you don't need to supply any data. If you're out of cell range, all you need to supply is the outside air temperature. Designed not to need an internet connection, so it will work anytime and anywhere you need it.\n\nGreat tool for pilots, drag racers, engine tuners, golfers, or anyone who needs to conveniently find their Density Altitude, Altimeter Setting, Relative Aid Density (RAD), Specific Humidity or Absolute Pressure.\n\nNo ads or in-app purchases.\n\nWe love feedback!

      "label": "The forests and woodlands of the Pacific Northwest are ecosystems rich with edible wild mushrooms if you know where to look. Trouble is, seasoned wild edible collectors seldom share their 'honey holes', and searching in the wrong spots or at the wrong times will yield nothing but fatigue and frustration. This app can help guide you toward the right patches of woods where you have the best chance of discovering a dinner of foraged fungi!\n\nIt is a well-known fact that certain varieties of mushrooms tend to spawn in the vicinity of specific types of trees. This knowledge is what expert foragers use to reliably locate areas that produce mushrooms year after year. In this app, the relationship between tree and mushroom species is clearly outlined for 13 different edible mushrooms including Morels, Chanterelles, Black Trumpets, Lion's Mane, Chicken of the Woods, Buttons, Hedgehogs, Oysters, Man on Horseback, Boletes, Matsutake, and Honeys, and Blewits.\n\nIn addition to defining the link between trees and mushrooms, this app goes one step further. An inventory of millions of data points from forest stands across the state has been filtered and processed to clearly highlight specific areas that have the highest probability of yielding a harvest of mushrooms. These circular polygons are color-coded by species and attributed with useful information such as tree family and tree density, along with land unit name, so you can quickly differentiate between tree types in the map view and target the best areas to search. Indicator species referenced include Pine, Cypress, Redwood, Sitka Spruce, Grand Fir, Douglas Fir, Ash, Cottonwood, Oak, Maple, Tanoak, and Madrone. Even burn areas are included to help find Morels!\n\nThis app is designed for the remote wilderness! Integrated geolocation makes it easy to figure out exactly where you are and track your precise movement, even in the thickest of tree stands. You can download offline map tiles in advance if you are planning to venture beyond the reach of a cellular connection in your quest for fungus. It works just fine in 'Airplane Mode'!\n\nThere is a wealth of useful information including descriptions of the different mushrooms and details on their characteristics. These sections even have buttons which will filter the map to show only tree species that are associated with a target mushroom! It is truly that easy...you want to find morels? Turn on the app, Show Morel Trees, and plot your GPS location to find the nearest forest stands where morels likely spawn. \n\nYou can manually toggle given tree species on or off if you're an arborist specifically interested in forestry rather than mushrooms. This app is a great way to discover old forest stands or to learn how to identify certain types of trees by look. If you are interested in finding birch bark, oak acorns, or sugar maples, just turn on a given layer and eliminate the guessing and frustration! Need some pine needles and cones for an art project? Pick from thousands of woodland patches laden with beds of them!\n\nThe data is attributed with Unit Names from the Public Land dataset - this way you can determine the name of the areas you are considering hunting and obtain any necessary permissions. Fortunately, it is legal to forage for personal consumption on most state-owned lands in the United States, but it is always best to be sure!\n\nMushroom hunting is not a precise science, and it takes time and effort to be successful. While there is never any guarantee that you will find what you seek when foraging for wild fungi, this app will greatly increase your chances to rapidly locate the species that you desire. It was created by a naturalist and certified mushroom forager and has been tested and verified to work! Enjoy this app and share it with your close friends...but respect the power contained within and leave some mushrooms for the next person to find!"

It can decode SNOWTAM reports from METAR information.\n\nThe strength of the tool lies in the amount of values you need to enter. Nobody is really willing to fill a lot of data to get simple calculation result. So the only data you need to enter are:\n•Intermediate approach altitude\n•Descent angle of the approach\n•Minimums\n•Runway elevation\n•Height over the runway threshold\n•And, of course, the temperature at the airport either in °C or °F\n•MSA and Go Around altitudes, if required\n•Optionally you may need to enter DME shift to work with DME’s offset from runway threshold.\n•Optionally SNOWTAM\n\nAs a reward for your effort you get in graphical and handy form:\n•Temperature corrected altitudes for all entered values\n•Temperature corrected altitudes for altitudes above the intermediate approach altitude\n•Temperature corrected altitudes for all relevant DME distances rounded in the way which makes them easy to use\n•Temperature corrected descent angle for FPA enabled airplanes\n•Pressure altitude of the airport in hectopascals\n•Table with temperature corrected (and uncorrected) values of vertical speeds (ft/min) during descend for different ground speeds (kt)\n•Table with conversion between QFE values in meters and QNH values in feet, of course with temperature corrected altitudes as well. All optimized for use in Russian regions\n•Decoded SNOWTAM including braking actions based on friction coefficient according ICAO as well as Normative/CIS scales. It provides (experimental) recommendation for braking actions based on runway contaminant and airport temperature.\n•RCAM - Runway Condition Assessment Matrix based on ICAO GRF – Global Reporting Format for Runway Surface Conditions.\n\nCorresponding aviation authority can certify this tool.

And now, in version 2.0 you also get an intuitive graph that shows sunrise, sunset, moonrise, moonset, and moon phase at a glance. Save recent locations, find locations using GPS location, and save graphs for later.\n\nTides have a great influence on the lives of boaters, fishermen, surfers, coastal communities, marine life, and vacationers just to name a few. Directly or indirectly, the great flow of our massive ocean bodies of water impact the daily lives of everyone on this planet.\n\nThe cyclical movement of the Earth's tides are caused by a combination of the gravitational forces of the sun and moon as well as the shape of the costal region. Unlike simple tide clocks that you can buy in novelty stores, more accurate tide predictions use special data gathered by instruments located at each tide station. The data from these measurements are used to determine the harmonic components which then feed into the mathematical algorithms which predict tides for the future. The end results are tested for accuracy and adjustments are made as necessary.\n\nTide Graph has US owned Tide Stations Only.

      "label": "This app provides complete offline topographic map coverage of the South Island of New Zealand from the LINZ Topo50 1:50k scale map series.  The maps are all contained in the installation so there is no additional need for downloads, no need for phone or wifi signal, no slow server issues, no account signups, no missing tiles, and no additional map fees. Just install for seamless off-line zooming and panning across the whole island down to 1:50,000 scale. The app also includes 1:50k resolution satellite images for the island and elevation data.\n\nOther integrated data includes DOC open and restricted hunting permit boundaries, DOC huts, campgrounds, and tracks, Fish and Game access points, and Te Araroa trails. Other datasets can be imported.\n\nThe app has a full suite of navigation functions including GPS location, compass orientation, distance to map locations, track recording and graphing, route creation and following, import/export of gpx and kml files, search functions for named places and user data. Add and edit your own locations and routes and plot elevation profiles. Uses an intuitive simple interface, with one-touch access to all functions.\n\nLINZ TOPO250 series maps are used at lower zoom levels for easier navigation.\n\nPerfect for outback use out of cell phone range. GPS and maps function fully without phone coverage. No need to cache files in advance either as they are all fully installed with the app. Popular with trampers, hikers, runners, bikers, search and rescue (SAR), hunters, boaters, as well as survey applications.\n\nNote that continuous use of GPS will run down the battery faster than when not using the GPS. The NZTopo50 app gives you full control over when GPS is used. The map can be used without GPS, intermittently with GPS for spot checking of location, continuously for logging while the app is open, or for continuous background logging when the phone is off. \n\nCheck our website for links to user guides and useful tips and tricks.\n\nFeel free to get in touch with any suggestions."

For all mariners, from kayakers to ship captains.\n\nProduct Description:\n\nBased on the International and US Inland Navigation Rules along with the published edition of the USCG database of license exam questions, this App helps you master the Navigation Rules using a practice exam driven methodology.\n\nUsing NavRules you generate practice exams where you:\n• control the number of questions,\n• control the scope of the questions (international vs inland),\n• specify a filter (a text string that must appear in the question),\n• specify the rule the questions pertain to,\n• identify whether the question has been previously answered or not, or answered incorrectly or not.\nThis gives you control over the tests that are generated so you can focus your learning experience.\n\nAfter taking an exam you can review the results to see:\n• which questions were answered correctly,\n• for incorrect answers the correct answer,\n• the rule the question pertains to so you can understand the context of the question.\n\nEvery practice exam you take tracks your results relative the the Navigation Rules Question Pool.  By browsing the Question Pool you can see your progress on understanding each rule.\n\nFor each rule NavRules reposts:\n• your coverage (number of questions you have answered) and,\n• your proficiency (the percentage of questions you have answered correctly).\n\nIf you want to study a rule you can link directly to the questions related to that rule and choose the answers.  In this \"review\" mode you get immediate feedback on whether your answer is correct (but these results are not recorded and do not impact your rule coverage or proficiency).\n\nThe Flash Card mode lets you see all the diagrams used in the tests and from each of them see the questions that reference that diagram.\n\nThe included Rule Book provides:\n• index to US Inland, International and Canadian Rules,\n• link to all illustrations used in the Navigation Rules,\n• link to all vessel lights by vessel type,\n• definitions,\n• demarcation lines,\n• special terminology,\n• distress signals\n• references.\n\nOther features include:\n• over 1200 answered and referenced questions on the Navigation Rules,\n• complete copy of the Navigation Rules,\n• custom design your practice tests by number, filter, and type so you can focus on what you need to learn,\n• rules are clearly identified as Inland and International or both,\n• all practice tests results are stored until manually deleted,\n• Canadian Modifications to the Navigation Rules."

It's like having a log book and data recorder in your pocket! Hot air is loaded with lots of different features; many based on pilot feedback from around the world.\n\n---------------------------\nMajor Features:\n---------------------------\n\n- Real-time tracking! Great for improving situationally awareness, see your current location on a map or satellite imagery\n\n- Waypoints to show your distance, bearing, and ETE to a target location\n\n- Offline maps available\n\n- Record your entire flight path (you can even turn your screen off during recording)! Then you can export your flight to your computer and view it in 3D using Google Earth\n\n- KML/KMZ overlays! Add custom overlay data to the real-time flight maps (can be used to map out electric lines, friendly or unfriendly places to land, denoting special airspaces, include information such as radio frequencies or phone numbers, etc.).\n\n- Wind data tracking - records wind speed and direction at the various altitudes as you fly\n\n- Integration of the Glympse location sharing service to allow ground crew, family, or others to track your flight in real-time. They can track you using almost any device with a data connection. \n\n- Flight Log- the log makes it easy to track information common to all pilots such as crew members, passengers, maximum envelope temperature, and propane used. The log also makes saving takeoff and landing locations convenient, thanks to the iPhone’s GPS or triangulation capabilities; plus, it has a \"favorites\" list for takeoff locations. The log can also aid in flight planning and separates future flights from past flights using a simple color-coding scheme. \n\n- Flight Data Summary: this tab quickly tallies flights and hours flown. The summary includes a total of all flights or just the ones made within the past 90 days. Plus a summary of the crew used for past flights.\n\n- Summary Map: on the map tab, the logged flights that have a saved takeoff and landing location can be plotted and compared on an interactive map \n\n- Data export: export your flight log in HTML, KML (for viewing in Google Earth), and GPX (GPS Exchange)\n\n- Data backup and restore - to be certain your data is safe!\n\n- Comprehensive payload calculator\n\n- Measure Tool\n\n- View weather conditions and forecasts from within the app\n\n- Universal app - works on iPad (landscape and portrait) as well as the iPhone and iPod touch! \n\n- Facebook integration - it is easy to post a quick summary of your latest flight to Facebook and even includes a link to a map! \n\n- Real-time tracking heading projection-line option\n\n---------------------------\nThis app includes translations in English, French, Czech, and Slovak!\n---------------------------\n\nNote: During real-time flight mode the GPS is continuously running in the background which can significantly decrease battery life."

With AyeTides you will never see those annoying ads or be asked to pay for additional features! Sailors, harbor pilots, beachcombers, nature photographers, and more use AyeTides to plan their outings on or around the world's oceans. \n\nHere are some of the things people are saying about AyeTides... \n\n\"AyeTides is a quality professional product”\n\n\"Your support has been the best I have experienced!\"\n\n“As a harbor pilot in New York I’ve been using your excellent tide and current app”\n\n\"I really appreciate the effort that you put into making AyeTides as accurate as it can be. It is a great program that has been very useful to us. I think we have 60 pilots using iPhones and iNavX and your app links in so well.\"\n\n\"I am a ships Pilot in BC and use Aye Tides a lot and it has become invaluable.”\n\nYou can see the day’s events in tabular form, or you can rotate the phone for an interactive graph that shows you the tide’s value at any point during the day. You can find a station on a map, by name, or based on your current location.\n\nAyeTides is updated regularly and stations are added whenever we find new data. We encourage our customers to contact us if you hare having any issues with the program so that we can help you. \n\nThis app is designed to run on your iPhone or iPod Touch. While it will run on your iPad, it does not offer the additional features available with AyeTides XL, which was designed specifically for the iPad. If you have multiple devices, you may want to consider our bundle. You get both apps at a discount!\n\nThis is the only place to install AyeTides. Other websites may look like they have AyeTides, but they do not. We only support iOS, any other version of AyeTides is not ours."

Here’s a few of our favorite reviews…\n\n\n“Pinbox is one of those simple apps that does one thing so well it feels frictionless”.\n-- Stephen Grassie\n\n\n“The interface is gorgeous - I would say that it looks like something Apple designed”.\n-- Macaddict\n\n\n“I have been using this to keep track of all the places the kids and I go so they can see how spread out our world is and they can see where all we have gone. Will use it forever”.\n-- 1Cool Daddy\n\n\n“This app is extremely useful and so simple to use. A lifesaver for keeping track of locations”.\n-- Davies Photo\n\n\n“I love this app. It is exactly what it claims to be. I have wanted this app since the smartphone was invented. So simple, and so many uses”.\n-- T1Man\n\n\n\nUsing Pinbox on an iPod Touch or an iPad:\nLike other map apps, Pinbox uses GPS to determine your location. iPods and Wi-Fi-only iPads do not have a GPS receiver. On these devices, Pinbox provides your approximate location using information based on your proximity to known Wi-Fi networks (when on and available). The more accurate the available information, the smaller the circle identifying your position on the map. This feature is not available in all areas. Known Wi-Fi networks are predominantly in urban areas. An internet connection is required to load maps, look up addresses, and search. Although Pinbox can be installed on iPads, it’s not formatted for the larger iPad screen - it runs doubled like all other iPhone apps.\n\n\n\nPinbox is the result of a collaboration between Scott D. Smith and Paul Burd. We sincerely hope you like it!"

To install a map, touch for about half a second.  Touch again to view it.\n\n* Search by name for over a million towns, peaks, lakes, parks and other features.\n\n* No network connection is needed once the maps have been installed.\n\n* Mark waypoints, and import and export waypoint files in GPX, KML and CSV formats.\n\n* Touch the \"current location\" button to see where you are, and the compass button to align the map with the ground.\n\n* See coordinates in NAD27 or WGS84 degrees, degrees minutes and seconds, UTM, or MGRS formats.\n\n* Measure distances (miles, feet and km) and bearings (true and magnetic).\n\nThe Maps: This app uses high-quality scans of the traditional USGS and NRCan topographic maps which have been the definitive resource for hikers and other backcountry users for many years.  You can make the terrain stand out with hill shading, using simulated sunlight from the direction of your choice.  In the U.S., this app does not use the new \"US Topo\" maps because they do not show hiking trails and lack other details: please see the web site for more details.\n\nDownloading: US maps are around 8 MB in size and download in a few seconds on a typical home broadband connection.  Canadian maps are larger.  Both cellular data and WiFi can be used, though WiFi is likely to be more reliable in most cases.\n\n- Do please visit http://topomapsapp.com/ for complete instructions, so that you don't miss any features.\n\nWe have many ideas for additional features to add to future versions of this app; if you have ideas or other questions or comments, contact details can be found on the website, http://topomapsapp.com/. The website also has more screenshots and other information."

The app uses your GPS location to track your boat on the map to keep you aware of what bridges and no wake zones are coming up on your route.  NOAA boating charts can also be used as the base map!\n\nThis is a must have for recreational boaters in Florida and snowbirds cruising south for the winter down the ICW.  Boating in FL can be frustrating due to no wake zones and limited bridge openings.  Limited bridge openings could mean waits of up to an hour or more.  This tool will help you to stay informed and plan accordingly.\n\nThe app covers all of the waterways in Florida, including the Intracoastal Waterway (ICW), bays, inlets and canals.  Also covers key areas such as the Okeechobee Waterway, New River, and more.  Includes information from a variety of sources, including NOAA charts, state and federal Manatee Protection Zones, Boating Safety Zones and more. It covers the ICW all the way up to Chesapeake Bay, and all coastal waters and rivers up through VA.\n\nTide station information was also added.   For each tide station, the times for high and low tides each day are shown.  Tidal heights are included as well.\n\nNOAA Coastal Waters Forecasts are now included.  These include wave height forecasts up to five days out.  NOAA Raster Nautical Charts can also be used as the background maps.\n\nSpeed and heading data are now included.  If your primary GPS/plotter fails, you've got NOAA Charts, speed and heading...Everything you need!"

      "label": "“Awesome!!! The best speed app on iphone” 5 Stars by kurtonic\n\nSpeed Box is a Speedometer and GPS app for both your iPhone and iPad. It displays your current speed, distance, direction and altitude along with your top speed and average speed. The app also keeps a record of the speed and altitude for the last few hours.\n\n\nMAIN FEATURES\n========================\n\n* MPH, KM/H and KNOTS\n* Show decimal speed (e.g. \"45.7 mph\")\n* One app for both the iPhone and iPad\n* \"Speak speed\" - Tap screen to have the speed spoken to you\n* 11 Analog and digital speedometers\n* Map view\n* Maximum and average speed\n* Altitude \n* Digital compass \n* HUD display to see speed in windshield \n* Odometer to measure distance traveled \n* Chart of the traveled speed and altitude \n* Warning signal when driving too fast \n* Export last 3 hours of data \n* Change maximum displayed speed on speedometer \n* Swipe finger over chart to display historic data \n* Display GPS accuracy by tapping the indicator in the top left corner \n\n\nUSER REVIEWS\n========================\n\n5 Stars by Darekakuta \n\"Just what I needed. My '58 chev's speedo doesn't work. This did the trick.\" \n\n5 Stars by Rawd \n\"Great My 79 Firebird speedo only goes to 140 kmh. ;). This worked perfectly.\" \n\n5 Stars \n\"Within 1 mile per hour +/- Great Job!\" \n\nSpeedBox was one of the very early Speedometer Apps for the iPhone. Take advantage of my experience and the refined algorithms that can get a much greater accuracy from the iPhone then a lot of other apps. I regularly update my application to make it even more accurate and usable. \n\nUsers have already used our application to verify the accuracy of their car's speedometer or they tried measuring the speed they achieved while skiing. Can you come up with more ideas? How about measuring the speed of the airplane you travel with? \n\nUSAGE NOTES\n========================\nThe \"GPS strength\" indicator in the top left corner should display a green dot. You can tap this indicator to display the current GPS accuracy.\n\nPlease allow the application up to a minute to find enough satellites to work correctly. \n\nIf you get a message to enable GSP, please go to ”Settings > General > Location Services“ on your iPhone and check if the little switch is set to \"On\" for Speed Box as well as for \"Location Services\" in general. \n\nATTENTION iPod touch users! Unfortunately this app doesn't work very well on the iPod touch and the iPad WiFI (without 3G) since these devices are missing a GPS!\n\n\nFEEDBACK\n========================\nIf you've got any wishes or suggestions for new features, please let me know with the contact form on this application's website (see link below).\n\nI am already working on the next update!"

      "label": "This app puts the Mayan Dreamspell Calendar in your pocket! \"13:20:Sync makes it so much easier to understand and integrate the calendar into every day life. Highly recommend it.\" \n\nThe Mayan People have described, in breathtaking precision, the cycles of both the universe and nature around us. They created a harmonic calendar that is synchronized to all those cycles. Following these cycles can help you get a stronger connection with nature around you and become conscious of your essence.\n\nThis app provides a simple way to sync along those cycles, to raise our frequency and give us a new lens to view both our day-to-day and planetary events.\n\n- Did you ever realize that our (Gregorian) calendar is not a harmonic calendar? \n- Did you know that the moon has 13 (not 12!) orbits around the earth in 1 year? \n- Why do we live with this irregular calendar?\n- Are you interested in Astrology?\n\n-> All this, and more, is explained carefully in this app. (over 15.000 words on 37 pages) Please note that these text are in English language only.\n\nIn the New Time, synchronicity is the norm.\n\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// \n5 star rating across the world! \n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// \n\"Entertaining as well as enlightening\" \n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// \n\nMORE INFO: \nwww.1320sync.com \n\n\nFor the beginner this app is a learning tool because it contains an extensive explanation about Tones and Seals and the synchronizing order of the Mayan Astrology. You may think it's difficult at first but soon you will feel how it all connects. \n\n\"This app is great, and allows easy manipulation of dates. I spent years in books doing in hours what I can now do in seconds.\"\n\nFor the ones who are already familiar with the Mayan Calendar this app is a handy tool to navigate the cycles, and calculate the Combined Kin for any given combination. Furthermore this app can be of great assistance to teach other people about the 13:20 cycles and is used in teachings around the world.\n\n\n=== FEATURES ===\n\n+ Kin Calendar\nThis is your main Mayan Dreamspell Calendar Dashboard with all the details you need to stay in sync. Shows the Kin of today by default, and you can calculate the Kin for any other date.\n\n+ Personal Notes\nOn this new page you can keep your personal notes for the 2 main cycles of time: the Tzolkin cycle of 260 days and the 13 Moon cycle of 365 days.

      "label": "Do you need GPS NMEA location data for your computer or other device - maybe to use some mapping or navigation software?\nUntil now, you couldn't get external access to the GPS inside your iPhone or iPad, but now with GPS2IP you can stream the information in realtime to solve your requirements.\n\nBEWARE - GPS2IP is *not* able to be used for the Apple turn-by-turn navigation app, or Google Maps, or most car navigation programs.\nIt is designed for enthusiasts, or more sophisticated navigation software that can use an external wireless GPS unit. If you aren't sure what NMEA is, please check the website before buying.\nThis is a rather special piece of software, and must be used in the right system. PLEASE CHECK THE WEBSITE: www.capsicumdreams.com/iPhone/gps2ip/\n\nWe have a free version \"GPS2IP Lite\" that has most of the same features, so that you can try it out for free.\nHave a look on our website: http://capsicumdreams.com/gps2ip/differences.php\nTry it for free, and only buy this full-featured version if it does what you need!\n\nThe iPhone becomes a GPS server, and to get the information, you just connect to your iPhone using either wifi or Bluetooth LE.\nAlternatively, you can also push the NMEA data to any online server, using either TCP or UDP and process the information however you want.\n\nEach device running GPS2IP can send a unique identifier, so that if you have multiple devices you can determine which device is sending what messages.\n\nGPS2IP now can be configured to restart automatically after your iOS device restarts, so you'll always keep track of your position.\n\nApart from navigation software, other methods for connection include telnet or netcat, or many terminal programs.\n\nSome navigation software such as MacEnc can read from an IP address natively.\nSetting up a connection between MacEnc and GPS2IP is easy.\nJust have a look at the capsicumDreams website!\nhttp://capsicumdreams.com/gps2ip/\n\nDifferent NMEA messages can be selected for transmission according to your requirements.\nOne non-standard message that GPS2IP transmits that is very useful for sailing is $PASHR.\n\nGPS 2 IP can run when the iPhone sleeps to support constant location reporting, but be aware that continued use of the GPS when running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nIf your device dies or you turn it off when it was running, GPS2IP now automatically resumes sending the location. Beware that this will decrease battery life - we recommend keeping it charging if possible.\n\nGPS2IP can also be configured to output data at a selectable frequency (for example once every minute).\n\nYou can lock the settings, so that no unauthorised people can change the settings.\n\nLots more information and instructions on usage can be found on our website. Enjoy!"

      "label": "This is the easiest way to share your UTM coordinates!\n\n- Directly read the UTM coordinates of your position. Rotate the phone for larger numbers.\n- Send your position as UTM coordinates via e-mail or iMessage\n- A map link is included with the message\n- The receiver can use the map link on any smartphone or computer (Google Maps™ will open in the browser)\n\nNote that some competitor products are creating a map link which will translate to a nearby street address. This is NOT done by this map. Instead, IT WILL ALWAYS SEND A MAP LINK SHOWING A POSITION WITH BEST POSSIBLE ACCURACY. Even though sending a link that translates to a street address might sometimes be convenient in cities, it can also lead to huge errors. Imagine, for instance, that you have decided a meeting place somewhere in a large park. Then it is not so smart if the app instead indicates a position on one of the streets that are surrounding the park. SO IF YOU WANT THE MAP LINK TO SHOW THE CORRECT POSITION, CHOOSE THIS APP.\n\nUTM zones can either be handled fully automatically or entered manually as a one-time setting. (The latter may be a requirement in areas where maps are produced with non-standard UTM zones in order to avoid zone boundaries crossing a country or a map sheet.)\n\nThe supported datum is WGS84. Please, check that it is consistent with maps used in your region.\nSome other datums are very similar to WGS84 and are compatible within a few meters accuracy, e.g. NAD83 in the US and ETRS89 in Europe.\nNote, however, that some older datums, which may still appear on some maps, are NOT compatible, e.g. NAD27 in the US and ED50 in Europe.\n\n(This app is not possible to use in the polar regions, since \"UPS\" is not supported.)\n\n---\n\nDisclaimer:\nAll software may suffer from bugs and all electronic devices may malfunction or run out of battery. Viatact AB does not take any responsibility for injuries or losses caused directly or indirectly by the use of this app. Never go trekking in remote areas without a paper map, a traditional compass and the knowledge of how to use them!\n\n---\n\nGoogle Maps is a trademark of Google Inc."

It keeps a history of your locations with speed, course, altitude, and user activity data, lets you track your loved ones, check the speed they are travelling, get directions to their current location or view a street level picture of any place they are or they have been. You can also overlay and compare your contacts location against a GPX track: import from files, Strava or Apple Watch workout routes (the app integrates with HealthKit)\n\nMain features include:\n- safe location sharing with the people you trust, in real time\n- live data: force a contact’s device to immediately send a fresh location\n- passive and battery friendly: run in the background with no noticeable impact on battery life, location is periodically updated as the device moves\n- context data: location data can include location history, speed and course, altitude, whether you’re walking, running, moving in a vehicle or resting\n- you are in control: set who sees your current location or who has access to your location history with fine-grained access controls\n\nOther features: \n- excellent battery usage: PlaceTrack uses SLC mode (Significant Location Change) and region monitoring, NOT continuous background. PlaceTrack is suspended in the background most of the time and is woken up only when you move significantly (detected using cell towers signal); most of the time it just sleeps and the GPS hardware is powered off to preserve battery. Install the app and forget about it\n- save your location history for later viewing\n- optionally share your recent location or location history with authorized PlaceTrack contacts\n- forced contact location updates: you can ask for a live location update from a contact and the backend platform will silently ask your contact device for a new location update \n- delayed sync: stores your locations when network is unreachable and pushes them to the PlaceTrack servers when you're back online \n- in-app streetview images\n- track overlays: import route data from Apple Watch, Strava and GPX files\n- location sharing works using address book phone numbers: your phone number is authenticated through an sms code on your first activation \n- your data, including your phone number and location, is always sent on a secure connection (ssl) and is never shared with any third party"

These points are symbolized with over 80 color-coded icons that differentiate between the wide variety of categories. The main groups for these categories include Hiking / Biking, Camping / Lodging, Hunting / Fishing, Informative, Other Recreation, Searching, Water Related, and Winter Related.\n\nThe app even distinguishes property boundaries and includes hiking trails and Forest Service roads.\n\nOnce using the app, there are five screens. The Guide screen will provide data legends as well as helpful tips for optimizing your navigational experience. On the Info screen, you will find a number of spatial links to the different Forest Service forests, grasslands, and wildernesses. This is a great way to quickly locate specific places and discover new places to explore! The About screen provides links to all of the open-source resources used in the app and gives a little information about the developer GeoPOI. The Map Settings screen is where you can change between one of four different basemaps, download offline imagery, turn on geolocation, and toggle specific point categories. Finally, the Map screen is where it all comes together!\n\nOn the Map screen, there are a series of circle clusters at distant zooms that indicate how many points are within a given cluster. As you tap the clusters to zoom in, individual points and icons become visible, along with trails, roads, and boundaries. These features can be clicked on to reveal the name, location, and other useful information. The map screen also has two search tools - the left one can be used to look up addresses and towns, while the right one will allow you to query the names of the features in the database.\n\nThere is such a wealth of beauty out there waiting to be discovered. Never before has it been this easy to navigate our National Forests as you travel, no matter where in the United States you are or what kinds of places you are interested in visiting. It's time to experience the rich natural and cultural tapestry of our nation and pay homage to the places that make our country the great land that it is. Come navigate the US Forest Service lands with GeoPOI today!"

For anyone looking to curtail their phone usage, the Forest app might be for you.\"— Business Insider\n\nIf you want to temporarily put down your phone and focus on what’s more important in real life, you can plant a seed in Forest. As time goes by, this seed will gradually grow into a tree. However, if you cannot resist the temptation of using your phone and leave the app, your tree will wither. \n\nThe sense of achievement and responsibility will encourage you to stay away from your phone, and will help you make better use of your time. Stop getting distracted by your phone, make you self-motivated and get more things done.\n\nStay focused. Be present! \n\nSTAY FOCUSED\n• A interesting way to help you beat phone addiction and overcome distraction\n• Turn your focused moments into a lush forest.\n\nGET MOTIVATED\n• Earn rewards and unlock more than 50 new tree species and white noises.\n• Share your forest and compete with friends and users around the world.\n• Plant trees along with friends & family.\n• Unlock achievements and earn extra rewards.\n• Plant real trees on Earth and protect the environment with tree-planting organization Trees for the Future.\n\nSTATISTICS\n• Manage your own tags and view detailed statistics of your time distribution.\n• Browse your weekly, monthly and even your yearly big forest.\n• Track your focused time in the Apple Health App.\n• Track your daily phone usage and screen time.\n• Recall memories of your planting journey with our brand new Forest Timeline!\n\nIt's never to late to build up productive habits! \n\nNOTICE\n• Forest is an app available for both iPhone and iPad, and can be accessed across all iOS devices with a one-time purchase. To download or unlock non iOS version of Forest, this requires a separate purchase. However, by logging into the same account, the account data can be synchronized across all platforms.\n• Due to budget constraint, the number of real trees each user can plant is limited to five. We will be introducing limited time events that will allow users to plant more real trees. Please follow our social media page or check the in-app announcement for more updates.\n• There is only one version of Forest on the App Store. Other apps that are similar and mimics Forest are not developed by the Forest team.

Please do not use VPN, Proxy, VLANS and Subnets.\n\n* Latency is supreme (below 1 second) when you have good wifi network conditions\n\n* No hidden subscriptions or costs\n\n* Sound is not yet supported, but we are working on it. Please use Bluetooth speakers as a workaround.\n\n* Black screen issues: Some third party apps prevent screen mirroring. When you try to mirror them, you will just see a black screen on your TV, for example with Netflix and Disney+. This is a restriction chosen by Netflix and others, so we cannot fix it at the moment.\n\n\nIf you like the app and our constant work on it, please give the app a positive rating on the App Store.

There’s also a place to jot down your notes, and a deadline to keep you on schedule.\n\n• Your Areas\nCreate an Area for each sphere of your life, such as Work, Family, Finance, and so on. This keeps everything neatly organized, and helps you see the big picture as you set your plans in motion.\n\n• Your Plan\nEverything on your schedule is neatly laid out in the Today and Upcoming lists, which show your to-dos and calendar events. Each morning, see what you planned for Today and decide what you want to do.

Offering you the most accurate measurements using the center-line radius algorithm based upon the bender that you're using. \n\nEasily select between different types of benders and choose the size of the shoe and conduit type that you're using. The last bender that you selected will be the bender that appears when you open the app up again. See and edit your bender's information (Center-line Radius, Deduct, Gain, Setback, Travel, and Radius Adjustment) within the 'Bender Specs' section. \n\nQuickBend supports the following bends.\n\n• Offset\n• Rolling Offset\n• Matching Bends Offset\n• Matching Centers Offset\n• Parallel Offset\n• Three-Point Saddle\n• Four-Point Saddle\n• 90\n• Kick With 90\n• Matching Bend Kick\n• Matching Center Kick\n• Parallel Kick\n• Multiple Parallel Kicks\n• Compound 90 - Circle Obstruction\n• Compound 90 - Rectangle Obstruction\n• Compound 90 - Square Obstruction\n• Segmented 90\n\nQuickBend Benders\n\n• Cosecant (Okay. it's not a bender, however;  if you prefer the multiplier method with no radius. It's available.)\n• Current Tools: 750/751\n• Current Tools: 77\n• Current Tools: 747\n• Gardner Bender: Big Ben\n• Gardner Bender: Sidewinder\n• Gardner Bender: Electric Sidewinder\n• Gardner Bender: B2000 Cyclone\n• Gardner Bender: Ultra Eegor\n• Gardner Bender: B300 Series\n• Greenlee: Hand Benders\n• Greenlee: 1800/1801\n• Greenlee: 1818\n• Greenlee: 555\n• Greenlee: 854DX\n• Greenlee: 855GX\n• Greenlee: 881\n• Greenlee: 884/885\n• Ideal: Hand Benders\n• Klein: Hand Benders\n\nQuickBend Multiple Bends\n• Layout multiple bends on a single stick of conduit.\n• Offset to Obstruction\n• Offset from Obstruction\n• Three Point Saddle\n• Four Point Saddle\n• 90 Bend, Kick\n• Kick with 90\n• Place a cut mark for those rare occasions that you need to cut and thread the conduit before bending.\n• Flip bends around.\n• Graphic representation of where the bend/cut will layout on a stick of conduit.\n• Bend layouts are based on your benders centerline radius, deduct, and gain.\n• Toggle 'Measure to Centers' to help line up conduits when working on raceways with multiple conduit sizes.\n\nQuickBend includes a protractor level which is easily accessible and can be Zeroed by a simple tap.\n\nQuickBend allows you to pick between either form of measurements, imperial (inches) or metric (cm).\n\nQuickBend's QuickCheck indicates if bends are impossible by a subtle change of turning the measurements and text red.\n\nQuickBend's center-line radius algorithm is especially useful when bending conduit that is larger than 1 inch and bends that exceed 30 degrees.\n\nIf you'd like to make any suggestions or just want to say 'hi' please e-mail me at rigidpro@outlook.com"

There is no need to navigate through multiple screens just to get a measurement.  Easy and intuitive to use, and measurement are displayed in big font to make it easy to read.\n\n+FAST ONE SCREEN CALCULATIONS\nSimple one screen calculations that show results \"live\" and on the fly as you slide your finger to enter values in.\n\n+ACCURATE CALCULATIONS\nCenterline bending radius - based calculations are also available.  These calculations offer greater accuracy when compared to bending multiplier methods.  Preposition your bends automatically.  All bends take shrink into account so you don't have to do any math.  What's faster - bending it twice or bending it right the first time?\n\n+PROTRACTOR FUNCTION INCLUDED\nUse the included protractor function to measure the angle as you bend.  Angle will be fed directly from your input screen to save you time.\n\n+BENDER PROFILES\nAlmost 100 different bender/pipe combinations included.  You have the ability to tweak or completely modify any of the combinations to match your bender on the field.\n\n+ WHO IS IT FOR?\nIf you consider yourself a craftsman that takes pride in his work, iBend Pipe is for you.  If other \"sparkies\" come to you when they have a difficult bend, this is for you.  If you want to have a smaller \"bone\"  pile, this is for you.  If you can write your name in conduit, this is for you.  From, a  1st year inside wireman apprentice to a seasoned “old timer” this app will save you time and material.\n\nInput fractions instead of converting to decimals and get results in fractions.\n\nThanks for all the great reviews, if you have any suggestions:\nsupport@ibendpipe.com"

Persistent & Effective\nAuto Snooze repeatedly* notifies you of missed reminders until marked done or rescheduled. Choose between intervals of every 1, 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 minutes.\n\n2. Fast to Set, Fast to Postpone\nA time picker with 12 preset and fully customizable times lets you set due dates and postpone reminders in record time.\n\n3. Natural Date & Time Parsing\nDue can also parse dates and times that you typed or dictate and offer to set the due dates and times for you.\n\n4. Countdown Timers\nPrecise to the second, perfect for making the perfect soft-boiled eggs, brewing your coffee and more. Set them up once and reuse them forever\n\n5. Powerful Recurring Reminders\nFrom the simple daily and weekly reminders to the complex every-3rd-Wednesday-of-the-month kind of reminders\n\n6. Keep in Sync**\nUse iCloud or Dropbox to keep your reminders and timers in sync across your iPhone, iPad and Mac.\n\n7. Works Offline, Completely Private\nThere is no account to sign up for. We don't store, and we can't access your reminders and timers. And you don't need internet to receive reminders.\n\n8. Accessible to Everyone\nAutomatically adjusts text size according to your system setting, and offers full VoiceOver support. Due is also localized in 17 languages.\n\n\n* By default, auto snooze repeats 5 times, and can be configured to repeat up to 10 times. Due can auto snooze any overdue items indefinitely when you launch Due or act on any of its notifications.\n** Sync on Mac requires Due for Mac (sold separately)\n\n\nWHAT'S THAT IN-APP PURCHASE ABOUT?\n\nWhen you purchase Due today, you will have access to every feature in the app today—no further purchase required.\n\nYou will also get access to all new features released one year from your date of purchase.\n\nThe optional Due Upgrade Pass subscription allows you to continue getting access to all new features released one year *after* your date of purchase.\n\nAnd here's the deal: Every feature that you have unlocked will remain available to you, forever—even if you stop subscribing.\n\nEven without a subscription, you'll always receive bug-fix and compatibility updates for free. These updates add support for the latest iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches. They also help ensure that Due continues to function well on the latest versions of iOS, iPadOS and watchOS.\n\nDue has a pretty good track record with that.\n\nTo illustrate: If you've purchased Due back in 2010 for your iPhone 3G running iOS 4, that very same app in 2022 is now optimized for iPhone 14 Pro Max running iOS 16. It even works on devices that didn't exist back then, such as the iPad Pro and the Apple Watch.\n\nTERMS & PRIVACY POLICY\n\nOur terms of use and privacy policy is available here: https://www.dueapp.com/terms.html\n\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\n\nDue requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad running iOS 12 or later."

      "label": "First released in 2009, GoodReader® is truly a veteran of the App Store.\n\nIn the modern app business, it's not easy to stay relevant that long. We're proud to say that after 13 years and counting, we've been delivering wonderful updates with extraordinary new features. And we're going to keep doing that!\n\nGoodReader is a perfect combination of document-reading and file-managing capabilities. It's your one-stop shop for all your document needs on your iOS device.\n\nUse the app once, and you'll be hooked. Soon you'll be wondering how you ever managed to work without it.\n\n-= File Reading =-\nPDF, TXT, MS Office, iWork, HTML, pictures, music & audio-books, videos. This is what you can view in GoodReader, plus you can also annotate PDF files and edit TXT files.\n\n-= PDF Reading and Annotating =-\nPDF files is where GoodReader truly shines. Reading experience is so superior, it's hard to describe. To rephrase one of our customers' review, \"try it, and you'll see.\" While you're at it, give our PDF Reflow feature a try. You'll be surprised how much better PDF reading goes when you don't have to scroll left/right all the time, for every single line of text.\nAnnotating PDFs is another star feature of our app. Adding notes and drawings, highlighting text, and then sharing your annotated files or annotation summaries will be your main productivity and collaboration asset.\n\n-= File Management =-\nWhile reading files is a big part of GoodReader, it's not all it can do. It can also serve as a central hub for all your files, even those that can't be opened by GoodReader itself. It's like bringing your personal computer experience to your mobile device — easily managing huge collections of files and folders will make you forget you don't have your laptop around.\n\n-= Connecting =-\nDropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive, Box.com, WebDAV, SMB, AFP, FTP, SFTP — these are all accessible from inside GoodReader. Download, upload, and sync (*) individual files or huge folder collections.\n\n-= Security =-\nWith GoodReader, your data security steps up to the level previously only dreamt of. With Pro Pack® (*), our new set of professional-level super-features, you'll get AES-256, a military-grade encryption, for all your data, at a price of a cup of coffee! And it's completely independent from the built-in Apple's Data Protection, so even if a hacker steals and unlocks your device, your data will still be protected by another strong layer of security, our own.\n\n-= Split-Screen =-\nThis wonderful feature allows you to split (*) an iPad screen in half, to read two files side-by-side. And even two different parts of the same file!\n\n(*): This feature requires a subscription to Pro Pack®, sold separately from inside the app as an in-app purchase."

      "label": "“The biggest software advance for writers since the word processor.” —Michael Marshall Smith, bestselling author\n\nTypewriter. Ring-binder. Scrapbook. Scrivener combines all the writing tools you need to craft your first draft, from nascent notion to final full stop.\n\nTailor-made for creating long manuscripts, Scrivener banishes page fright by allowing you to compose your text in any order, in sections as large or small as you like. Got a great idea but don’t know where it fits? Write when inspiration strikes and find its place later. Grow your manuscript organically, idea by idea.\n\nWhether you plan or plunge, Scrivener works your way: meticulously outline every last detail first, or hammer out a complete draft and restructure later. Or do a bit of both. All text sections in Scrivener are fully integrated with its outlining tools, so working with an overview of your manuscript is only ever a tap away, and turning Chapter Four into Chapter One is as simple as drag and drop.\n\nNeed to refer to research? In Scrivener, your background material is always at hand. Write a description based on a photograph. Reference a video or PDF. Check for consistency with an earlier chapter. On the iPad, open two documents side-by-side; on the iPhone, flip between research and writing with just two taps.\n\nOnce you’re ready to share your work with the world, simply compile everything into a single document for printing, or export to popular formats such as Word, PDF, Final Draft or plain text. You can even share using different formatting, so that you can write in your favorite font and still keep your editor happy.\n\n\nFEATURES\n\nGet Started\n• Interactive tutorial project\n• Keep each manuscript and supporting materials in a self-contained project\n• Import Word, RTF, Final Draft and plain text files\n• Easily split imported text into separate sections\n\nGet Writing\n• Write your manuscript in sections of any size\n• View all sections as a single text using the “Draft Navigator” (iPad only)\n• Quickly navigate sections using the “binder” sidebar\n• Format with fonts and presets\n• Comments, footnotes, links and highlights\n• Simple bullets and lists\n• Insert images\n• Pinch-zoom to resize text\n• Full-screen mode (iPad only)\n• Typewriter scrolling mode keeps typed text center-screen (iPad only)\n• Write a screenplay using scriptwriting mode\n• Live word and character counts\n• Set word and character count targets\n• Find and replace\n• Customizable keyboard row provides quick-access buttons for formatting, navigation and punctuation\n• Comprehensive keyboard shortcuts for external keyboard users\n• Dark mode\n\nFind Your Structure\n• Write in any order and reorganize later\n• Write a synopsis for any text section and see it in the outline\n• Expand, collapse and drill down into sections of your project\n• Rearrange sections as index cards on the corkboard (iPad only)\n• Project-wide search\n• Track ideas using labels and status\n• Apply custom icons to your sections\n\nRefer to Research\n• Import research material such as image, PDF and media files\n• View research files or other sections right alongside your writing (iPad only)\n• Every section has its own notes area for jotting down ideas\n• Supports multi-tasking split screen mode (supported devices only)\n\nShare Your Work\n• Compile to a single document for sharing or printing\n• Use different formatting in your exported or printed document\n• Export to Word, RTF, Final Draft, PDF or plain text\n• Convert rich text to Markdown for sharing with Markdown apps\n• Create and email zipped backups of your projects\n\nWork Anywhere\n• Use Dropbox to sync between devices and with the macOS and Windows versions of Scrivener*\n• Copy projects between devices via iTunes\n\n* Requires a Dropbox account (not compatible with iCloud).\n\nSUPPORT\nYou can contact us at ios.support@literatureandlatte.com, visit our forums at http://www.literatureandlatte.com/forum, or find us @scrivenerapp on Twitter."

Tap on the values for velocity or friction to switch between calculation methods.\n\nUsers can change between I-P and S-I units by tapping the toggle switch at the top.\n\nThe detailed sizing mode allows the Engineer to adjust the duct dimensions and air flow rates, while checking the resulting friction rate and velocity which update automatically. Detailed sizing mode is typically used to analyse existing duct systems, and was added upon the request of users' feedback. \n\nCalculations are based on standard air 0.075 lb/ft3 (1.2 kg/m3) in clean galvanized steel duct.\n\nAny feedback is welcome, and will be the basis for future updates."

The Do Less To-Do List\n\nBento helps you do less, but more meaningful tasks.\nWe all have plenty of to-dos on our list and our mission is to reduce task overwhelm to maximize achievement.\n\nBento doesn't replace your to-do list, it complements it!\nOne of the biggest productivity issues is prioritization - so we've limited you to 3 tasks per Bento box.\n\n---\n\nSo, how does Bento work?\n\nTASK LIMITS\n\nBento limits you to 3 tasks per box - to help you do less, but more meaningful to-dos. We limit how many boxes you can open to 7 boxes in total, to help you plan only what is most important. Our mission is to reduce task overwhelm to maximize achievement.\n\nSMALL, MEDIUM & LARGE TASKS\n\nMuch like a box for sushi, Bento allows you to create small, medium, and large tasks helping you to organize your tasks in sizeable chunks for better completion. The best productivity experts recommend reducing your workload for better per-task performance.\n\n3 ENERGY-BASED WORKFLOWS\n\nOnce you have your 3 priority tasks. We've created 3 workflows, Eat That Frog, Climb The Summit, and the Slow Burn to help you best order your day for success and energy.\n\nSINGLE-TASK FOCUS MODE\n\nTo truly focus, we need fewer distractions. Blocking out attention to focus on just your key task can make a huge difference. Inside Bento, we have a single-task focus mode combined with a countdown timer for deep focus work states.\n\nDARK & LIGHT MODE\n\nEach box can be customized with an emoji alongside stunningly animated themes. Each theme has a light mode and dark mode, for optimal productivity.\n\n6 BEAUTIFULLY ANIMATED THEMES\n\nRelaxing Japanese-themed backgrounds for a soothing way to handle your most meaningful tasks.\n\n---\n\nBento can be used in a variety of ways, here are a few recommendations:\n\n- Create a daily Bento to plan your 3 priority tasks\n- Plan the full week by adding up to 7 Bento boxes\n- Build a week, month, and yearly goals list for planning ahead\n\nThe Bento app is the best and most effective place to implement the Bento Methodology, a new mindful way to approach task management. Bento is now optimised for iPad as part of a single universal app for all your iOS devices.\n\n---\n\nQUESTIONS\n\nReach out on Twitter @BentoMethod or email bento@keepproductive.com for any help.\n\nPRIVACY POLICY\n\nFind the full privacy policy here: https://www.bentomethod.com/privacy"

Sometimes it's not easy to see your upcoming shift schedule very clearly, especially if your shifts don't fall into the traditional working week. Shift Worker solves this problem and turns the frustrating task of entry into a quick and easy experience.\n\nShift Worker allows you to create your own types of shifts by combining visually-attractive icons with letters/numbers so that they can be easily identified at a glance. By including a range of icons (such as suns and stars for day and night shifts) in a variety of colors, any combination is possible for all types of shifts.\n\nEntering shifts can be done quickly by simply selecting a type of shift and tapping on each date it occurs. An entire month of shifts could be entered in seconds, an entire year in a few minutes!\n\nIn addition, Shift Worker allows you create multiple calendars to see friends and family shifts! You can send your shifts to others so they can also see your shifts at a glance as an image or in their copy of Shift Worker. To make things even simpler, you can even save your shifts to your iPhone/iPod's background so that referring to your upcoming shift schedule is as simple as picking up your iPhone/iPod. \n\nShift Worker also includes the ability to create colored personalized notes for each date. Notes can be used anytime additional information needs to be added to a date.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n- Create a virtually unlimited amount of shift types\n- Enter shifts on the calendar months in advance in seconds\n- Add your rotation and automatically fill the calendar in a few simple steps\n- Show friends and family shifts using multiple calendars\n- View the calendar in timeline format to see your shift flow at a glance\n- Create colored personalized notes for any date on the calendar\n- Include week of year or week 1/2 alternating pattern on calendar\n- Jump to any month by using the \"Goto\" button\n- Save a month's worth of shifts to your background\n- Share your shifts to others via email, MMS, Facebook or Twitter\n- Import other Shift Worker shifts and view them all within the one app\n- No in-app purchases!\n- No ads!"

      "label": "UfYH: Terrifying motivation for lazy people with messy homes. \n\nPlease be advised that this app contains profanity. The word \"filth,\" in-app, is replaced by the other f-word. There is a lot of swearing. Really so very much swearing. Please do not buy this app and then be shocked by the swearing, because there is a lot of it, and here we are, telling you about it right up front. \n\nIf traditional housekeeping isn’t really your style, but your living space needs a little attention, UfYH’s challenges and customizable features will help you get your place back in shape, a few minutes at a time. Rather than encourage marathon cleaning sessions, UfYH gives you the tools to clean up, a little at a time. Unf&%*ing your habitat turns dreaded chores into easy-to-complete tasks, with a hefty dose of “filthy” language to motivate you to clean up.\n\n    -Clean and simple easy-to-use interface.\n    -Select timed challenges in 5, 10, or 20 minute intervals and try to beat the clock to finish the challenge.\n    -Select challenges by room.\n    -Create a customized to-do list and reminders to keep you on schedule.\n    -Earn achievements for completing challenges or finishing your to-do list.\n    -Use the 20/10 timer to reward yourself with a 10-minute break for every 20 minutes of work. Shorter challenges count cumulatively toward your total time.\n    -Random motivators remind you that excuses are boring and use a combination of a little guilt, a little shame, and a little swearing to get you moving. \n\nUfYH is especially useful for those who don’t have a lot of spare time to devote to cleaning: students, people with full-time jobs, people with roommates, anyone who can’t find the motivation to get up and just do something. Even if it’s just a little something! Our lives are complicated and messy, and we’re often overwhelmed and distracted, and sometimes a little lazy. Unf&%* things and see a remarkable difference in how you tackle cleaning.\n\nUfYH uses frequent profanity and is for mature audiences. In-app, the word \"filth\" is replaced by its older, more foul-mouthed cousin. This app uses the \"f-word.\" A lot. Please be aware of this before purchasing."

During the day whenever you achieve your goal or something positive enter it right away into the 3 Wins app. You can also pause at the end of your busy day to summarize and record your wins/achievements. By doing this, your brain will shift more towards positive thinking. \n\nTrack your achievements or personal goals, every day. Stretch your brain and take the good thoughts out before going to sleep and forgetting about them.\n\n\n=== WHAT IS A WIN? === \nA win can be anything positive you think of that was completed during the day. It can be something personal for example no junk food ate, or you made the bed in the morning. Treat all accomplished tasks in the day as a win and celebrate by checking them off. You can also track your business goals and achievements for the day, for example you met or exceeded your daily sales quota or finished that project you were working on for weeks! \n\nAppreciate your daily wins more!\n\n\n=== SAMPLE WINS ===\n• No junk food\n• Drank 8 glasses of water\n• Completed stretching\n• Breathe\n• Finished workout\n• Marketing project completed\n• First 5K run\n• Had a healthy snack\n\n\n=== HOW IT WORKS? === \nEach day has a goal to write down at least 3 wins to close the day on green. You can add random completed goals or create a repeating task that you will check off every day. Why 3? We want to stretch your brain and think more on the positive side. There had to be at least 3 things you have completed today?! Did you drink enough water, took a bike to work, parked further to walk more, said thank you, smiled. Any positive task completed is a win! And don’t be tied just to 3, if it was 1 or 10 write them all down!\n\n\n=== KEY FEATURES ===\n• Super simple achievement tracking.\n• Calendar view will show you a glance color coded view of your month. Dark green colors mean you have achieved 3 or more wins, lighter colors not quite there, but it is better than none!\n• Daily general reminder to get things noted.\n• Set reminders for your scheduled wins to get reminded to complete them.\n• Create wins/tasks that are repeating/recurring.\n• Supports Siri Shortcuts.\n• Apple Watch app.\n• iCloud sync\n• Confetti celebration for a full day of wins!"

Use it to create to do lists, make grocery lists, take notes, write an outline of a story, prepare notes for a presentation, make a list of gift ideas, plan a vacation... or anything else you'd want to make a list for.\n\n\nBEAUTIFULLY DESIGNED\n\nAssign a fun icon to each of your lists - there are over 450 to choose from. You can also select from 30 themes to customize the app's design to your liking.\n\n\nSIMPLE AND VERSATILE\n\nPaperless is easy to use with a clean, elegant and well thought out interface. Each list can either be a checklist or a regular list without checkboxes, making a wide variety of uses possible.\n\n\nREALLY HELPS YOU GET THINGS DONE\n\nFor checklists and todo lists, many people prefer using Paperless over traditional \"getting things done\" apps - or, they use it in addition to one. There are no due dates or priority settings, so you're left to focus on the actual tasks at hand, rather than waste time changing those settings when your priorities change. Instead, if a particular task becomes important, you can simply move it to the top of the list.\n\n\nAUTOMATIC BACKUP AND SYNCING\n\nAutomatically backup your lists and sync them between iOS devices via a free Dropbox account.\n\n\nPOWERFUL FEATURES\n\n- send lists via email, others can import your list into their copy of Paperless\n- send a plain text version of a list via iMessage, or copy it into another app\n- easily duplicate lists\n- manually reorder lists and list items\n- sort list items alphabetically\n- copy and move items from one list to another\n- comprehensive search\n- passcode lock\n\n\nPRAISED BY THE PRESS\n\n\"Paperless deserves a spot on your iPhone\" - Lex Friedman, Macworld (4.5 out of 5 mice rating)\n\n\"Paperless has a permanent spot on the first page of my iPhone's home screen... it will probably earn a similar spot on yours.\" - Marianne Schultz, AppShopper\n\n\"... a good way to ensure things get done at your own pace, free of the disappointment of missing deadlines.\" - Nick Spence, Macworld UK\n\n\"I've been trying many To Do apps since iPhone 1.0 -- from the expensive Things to Toodledo and others -- and I don't use any of them regularly. Most just require too much effort. Paperless is the first one I've found that hits that sweet spot between being simple enough you'll actually use it and powerful enough to be useful.\" - Marc Zeedar, REALbasic Developer Magazine (4.8 out of 5 rating)\n\n\"This is one nice-looking list / task app... As a basic list app, the beautiful Paperless reigns supreme.\" - Bonnie Eisenman, 148apps.com (4 out of 5 rating)\n\n\nPRAISED BY USERS\n\n\"Best app ever - The most incredibly useful app I've come across. Simple, effective and bloody marvelous!!!\"\n\n\"The simplicity of the interface and the flexibility given to the user is perfection.\"\n\n\"Simply loved it - Best app I've ever downloaded, my life is so organized now! ...\"\n\n\"After having tried a good deal of apps to get myself more organized - both free and paid - it is clear that this tops them all. Other apps presented a kind of novelty; I could fool myself into thinking that I was more organized, but it was never long before I abandoned them because it was obvious that they consumed unnecessary time. Paperless, however, has truly helped. It is streamlined, it is simple, it is sumptuous\"\n\n\nPLEASE RATE AND REVIEW\n\nIf you love Paperless, please leave a review and star rating. Thank you!"

      "label": "One evening, after a very long week of shows we were sat in the office looking at the show times wishing the running times would work them selves out (we've all been there), it was at this moment this show timing app was created. Welcome to the future of show timing without multiple stop watches and reminder alarms. Now you can start your show with the press of one button and the app does the rest. With unlimited Acts and Intervals in any configuration that you like! , just set your show structure, tell it your interval duration(s) and away you go. \n\nShow StopWatch also handles separate in act timers and show stops, adjusting the running and playing times accordingly! Once you have completed a show you can then email the times with a simple button press or copy them your clipboard as well as storing them for later. \n\nThere is also the option to have pre show notifications for back stage calls and the same again in the interval so you don't have to spend all your time looking at the clock. The app will also run in the back ground of your phone if for what ever reason you need to use your phone for something else (certainly not facebook, for those long scenes with no cues) while its running. \n\nThis app was created by stage managers for stage managers, it is currently being used by a number of productions and companies including UK Tours, West End shows and Repertory Theatres. It will continue to be a working development so any thing you come across that you think ‘it would be great if’ please don't hesitate to get in contact! It became apparent while testing how tiny details make a difference to everyone so we have tried to incorporate them all, for example; the interval timer shows both time elapsed and remaining, and is in green until you start over running when it goes red (because how often do you go up on time), and the ability to access times so far, for those quiet moments where you are able to start the show report early!\n\nThis app has not been made to replace your note book, still write times down if you get a chance, its simply to try and make life easier at the end of the show! Have a play, get to know it and let us know how you get on!\n\nIf you want to get in contact email me at jackrlord@gmail.com"

      "label": "Designed for wildland firefighters, this app has something for newbies as well as seasoned professionals. This is a tool you will use for years, during the off season, at camp, and even on the fireline. \n\nWildland Toolkit provides a plethora of wildland fire reference material, including the actual IRPG, ICS forms, quizzes that cover NWCG courses, photos of tools and aircraft types, etc. Learn new things, and reinforce what you already know.\n\nIf you’ve had S290 or S390, you know how hard it is to calculate things like FDFM, PIG, rate of spread, flame length, etc. With this app, those numbers are spit out instantly as you take the weather! Now you can store all your weather logs for all your fires right on the app. The goal has always been to make recording the weather easier than paper.\n\nEven better, you can share those weather logs from the field if you have network coverage, or wait until later and pull them up on your iPad or M1-based Mac, where all the data is synced, and do further analysis and sharing.\n\nJust enter the fuel, weather, and topography information and Wildland Toolkit will generate:\n\n--RH and Dewpoint\n--Fine Dead Fuel Moisture\n--Probability of Ignition\n--Flamelength\n--Rate of Spread\n--Scorch height\n--Direction of Max Spread\n--Effective Windspeed\n\nAll 54 of the new fuel models are supported, with a guide to select the proper fuel model, complete with sample photos.\n\nNOTE: There are no known calculation errors in this version. We will immediately fix any problems reported to us directly.  \n\nWildland Toolkit is not a tutorial on wildland fire behavior, so if the terms above do not make any sense, then this application will not teach you. It is assumed that you know the same background information that is presented in an S290 or S390 class. The calculations done in the Wildland Toolkit are similar to what is done with the BEHAVE software, but you will find the user interface much easier to use.\n\n--In addition, numerous safety checklists and reference guides are included, such as watchouts, fire orders, safety zones, watchouts, structure defense, sizeups, crew briefing, after action reviews, LCANS, and complexity analysis etc. \n\n--Photos and diagrams are provided for cloud types, hand signals, common wildland tools, firefighting aircraft, and ICS org charts. \n\n--Interactive practice quizzes are included for basic wildland fire, CPR, NIMS IS-700, S230 and S290.\n\n--ICS reference guide with position descriptions, an index of forms, and incident typing\n\n--Pack Test Timer guides you through your pack test and tells you your current pace and expected finish time ***\n\n--Cool Slope Calculator uses your phone to tell you slope\n\n--And if that's not all, the IRPG is provided in PDF form\n\n*** Pack Test timer uses GPS. Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. GPS is not used if the Pack Test is stopped."

      "label": "iCircuit is the premier iPad and iPhone app for designing and experimenting with circuits and Arduinos. Its advanced simulation engine can handle both analog and digital circuits and features realtime always-on analysis. It is the perfect companion to students, hobbyists, and engineers.\n\nYou use it as you would any CAD program: you add elements, connect them together, and set their properties.\n\nBut iCircuit is unlike other CAD programs because it is always simulating. It's just like working with the real circuit. You do not stop to take a measurement or spend a lot of time configuring reports. Instead, you just play with the circuit as you normally would, with the power on!\n\nThere are over 70 elements you can use to build your circuits. The app has everything from a programmable Arduino, to simple resistors, to switches, to MOSFETS, to digital gates.\n\nThe app features a multimeter that you use to probe around the circuit to instantly read voltages and currents. If you want to see how a value changes over time, then you can add values to the built-in oscilloscope. The scope can simultaneously track many signals over time and features a touch interface to control the total time displayed and stacked and unstacked modes to easily compare signals. The scope can also display the Fourier transform of any signal so that you can see the performance of filters.\n\nSupported elements include:\n\n• Programmable Arduino using a subset of the C programming language\n• Signal generators, Voltage sources, Current sources, and Dependent sources\n• Resistors, Capacitors, and Inductors\n• Manual SPST/SPDT and DPST/DPDT Switches, Push buttons, and Relays\n• LEDs, Diodes, BJ Transistors, and MOSFETs\n• Audio simulation with Speakers, Microphones, Buzzers, DC Motors, and LEDs\n• ADCs, and DACs\n• Logic gates: AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR\n• JK and D Flip-flops\n• 38 7400 series digital parts \n• 78xx and LM317 voltage regulators\n• 7-segment display and driver\n• Antenna with simulated AM and FM signals\n\nYou can also create sub circuits to introduce new elements and componentize your designs.\n\nNo matter your skill set, you'll be playing with circuits in no time with iCircuit."

      "label": "Notebooks is a writing app, a text and markdown editor, your personal Wiki and Zettelkasten, a file organizer, task manager, PDF and eBook creator and more. This may sound like a lot, but consider you have a few text fragments, randomly created, which you want to combine into a chapter of a book and saved as PDF or eBook; or a quick note sparks off an idea, generates a couple of tasks, each of which requires you to organize further research material; or you have business related documents which need to be separated from private diaries, records and files. – With Notebooks you handle these jobs easily without switching apps, and while remaining focussed and creative.\n\n• Notebooks stores all your documents as regular files in standard formats. You are always in control of your documents, never need to worry about how to export them, and they remain compatible across devices and over time.\n\n• Create formatted documents with styles, attachments, tables or checklists, and add a table of contents if you like. Choose between a variation of ready made document styles, or create your own, if you want.\n\n• Write your documents in plain text and allow Notebooks to automatically handle lists, highlight and center the current line on screen, automatically insert closing characters for  (, {, [, \" and more. - Plain text is a universal format which can be used on any device without any specific software.\n\n• Use Markdown to create formatted documents from plain text. Notebooks supports *MultiMarkdown* and its own flavor of *Discount*.  – Click any word in a formatted Markdown text and start writing at that position. You can even create checklists (- [ ]) and tick them off in formatted view. Syntax highlighting and a set of dedicated extra keyboard keys make Markdown editing easy.\n  \n• Use your Apple Pencil to sketch ideas or annotate images and PDF documents.\n\n• Use Notebooks' advanced editing capabilities to work on documents which are stored in other apps.\n\n• Compile selected documents or the contents of whole books into a single document, an eBook or a PDF document.\n\n• Link between documents in Notebooks. In Markdown you can even use Wiki style links ([[ ]]). When clicking a link to a document which does not yet exist, Notebooks suggests to create it. And when you move or rename documents, Notebooks makes sure the links remain intact.\n\n• Create as many books as you need to structure your projects and details. Nest books as deep as you like, there is no limit in Notebooks. If you ever loose track, Notebooks' full text search helps you quickly turn up even the most hidden document.\n\n• Turn books into task lists to display document as tasks which can be ticked off. Assign due dates and alerts, and divide projects into nested sub projects, which makes them easier to handle. \n\n• For simple lists you can use checklists in formatted documents and Markdown.\n\n• Assign Context tags to books and documents to create shortcuts that are accessible for a smart book at Notebooks' top level. – Notebooks can even extract context tags from the contents of documents as you create them.\n\n• Import all documents and files you want to keep close at hand, no matter whether PDF, email, web pages, MS Office or iWorks, photos, videos, music and more.\n\n• Scan documents and extract text using OCR (iOS 13)\n\n• Sync files between iPads, iPhones, Mac or PC. \n\nWith all that, Notebooks may quickly become your one and only app for everything you want to keep close at hand.\n\nUser Comments: \n\n“Notebooks is a wonderful App, which is so much better than the dozen other note apps I tried. It is sophisticated, in an unassuming way, so that you find yourself greatly rewarded and being productive without sacrificing time/effort to the App. I cannot tell you how much productivity I have gained.  I am having a huge amount of fun, I use it constantly, more than the phone on my iPhone in fact.\" \n\n“You are GTD in every way that makes it efficient and makes me efficient.”"

Hang-a-Pic will do just that!\n\nUsing a very friendly walk-through interface, Hang-a-Pic can tell you exactly where to put your nails (or wall-plugs, etc.) in the wall for each picture or ornament. No more headaches or extra holes in the wall from guessing where the nails should go... All you need is a tape measure and Hang-a-Pic will figure out the rest!\n\nIt's so easy that a 12 year old child could take four pictures, each with two hooks on the back, and hang them precisely and evenly across a wall the first time! No extra holes, no \"oops!!\".\n\n- New Features added to support hanging a group of pictures (or anything else) with different frame widths, evenly spaced across a wall. For example, say you're hanging 3 pictures and the center picture is wider than the other 2, Hang-a-Pic will now make this an easy task to pinpoint exactly where your nails need to be for each picture! \n- Now supports as many as 5 pictures (or any thing else you're hanging), and each can be a different width. And they do *not* need to be hung symmetrically! \n- Send measurements to your Email address.\n- Print the measurements to your AirPrint compatible Printer.\n- Performance enhancements.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: Hang-a-Pic does not calculate how high you wish to hang pictures, mirrors, etc.. Some prefer staggering the height of each picture, some prefer hanging them all the same height. The height you wish to hang pictures is your particular visual preference. For example, do want them at eye-level or higher up on a wall with very tall ceilings? etc.. It's up to you. Hang-a-Pic will however, calculate perfect spacing between those pictures horizontally."

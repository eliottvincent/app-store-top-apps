It's the most advanced screen mirroring solution with zero delay and the highest screen quality.\n\nMirror photos, videos, games, websites, apps, presentations, documents and spreadsheets on Roku.\n\n* Supported Roku TVs: Hisense, Sharp, TCL, Insignia, Hitachi, Philips, Element, JVC\n\n* Your iPhone/iPad and your Roku must be connected to the same wifi to enable screen mirroring. Please do not use VPN, Proxy, VLANS and Subnets.\n\n* Latency is supreme (below 1 second) when you have good wifi network conditions\n\n* No hidden subscriptions or costs\n\n* Sound is not yet supported, but we are working on it. Please use Bluetooth speakers as a workaround.\n\n* Black screen issues: Some third party apps prevent screen mirroring. When you try to mirror them, you will just see a black screen on your TV, for example with Netflix and Disney+. This is a restriction chosen by Netflix and others, so we cannot fix it at the moment.\n\n\nIf you like the app and our constant work on it, please give the app a positive rating on the App Store.

For anyone looking to curtail their phone usage, the Forest app might be for you.\"— Business Insider\n\nIf you want to temporarily put down your phone and focus on what’s more important in real life, you can plant a seed in Forest. As time goes by, this seed will gradually grow into a tree. However, if you cannot resist the temptation of using your phone and leave the app, your tree will wither. \n\nThe sense of achievement and responsibility will encourage you to stay away from your phone, and will help you make better use of your time. Stop getting distracted by your phone, make you self-motivated and get more things done.\n\nStay focused. Be present! \n\nSTAY FOCUSED\n• A interesting way to help you beat phone addiction and overcome distraction\n• Turn your focused moments into a lush forest.\n\nGET MOTIVATED\n• Earn rewards and unlock more than 50 new tree species and white noises.\n• Share your forest and compete with friends and users around the world.\n• Plant trees along with friends & family.\n• Unlock achievements and earn extra rewards.\n• Plant real trees on Earth and protect the environment with tree-planting organization Trees for the Future.\n\nSTATISTICS\n• Manage your own tags and view detailed statistics of your time distribution.\n• Browse your weekly, monthly and even your yearly big forest.\n• Track your focused time in the Apple Health App.\n• Track your daily phone usage and screen time.\n• Recall memories of your planting journey with our brand new Forest Timeline!\n\nIt's never to late to build up productive habits! \n\nNOTICE\n• Forest is an app available for both iPhone and iPad, and can be accessed across all iOS devices with a one-time purchase. To download or unlock non iOS version of Forest, this requires a separate purchase. However, by logging into the same account, the account data can be synchronized across all platforms.\n• Due to budget constraint, the number of real trees each user can plant is limited to five. We will be introducing limited time events that will allow users to plant more real trees. Please follow our social media page or check the in-app announcement for more updates.\n• There is only one version of Forest on the App Store. Other apps that are similar and mimics Forest are not developed by the Forest team.

      "label": "iBend Pipe is the best conduit bending applicaiton on an iPhone, it helps you bend it right...the first time.  \n\nIt calculates the following bends using English or Metric measurements so you don’t have to:\n\n    -Offsets Bends (specify towards an obstruction or away from an obstruction)\n    -Rolling Offsets Bends  (specify towards an obstruction or away from an obstruction)\n    -Parallel Offset Adjustment\n    -3-Bend Saddles\n    -4-Bend Saddles\n    -Segment Bends\n    -90° Bends\n    -Back to Back 90° Bends\n    -Kicked 90°s Bends\n    -Compound 90° Bends around a Round Obstruction\n    -Compound 90° Bends around a Square Obstruction\n    -Compound 90° Bends around a Rectangular Obstruction\n\n+ HOW DOES IT WORK?\nSimply slide your finger to set measurements and results are updated instantly.  There is no need to navigate through multiple screens just to get a measurement.  Easy and intuitive to use, and measurement are displayed in big font to make it easy to read.\n\n+FAST ONE SCREEN CALCULATIONS\nSimple one screen calculations that show results \"live\" and on the fly as you slide your finger to enter values in.\n\n+ACCURATE CALCULATIONS\nCenterline bending radius - based calculations are also available.  These calculations offer greater accuracy when compared to bending multiplier methods.  Preposition your bends automatically.  All bends take shrink into account so you don't have to do any math.  What's faster - bending it twice or bending it right the first time?\n\n+PROTRACTOR FUNCTION INCLUDED\nUse the included protractor function to measure the angle as you bend.  Angle will be fed directly from your input screen to save you time.\n\n+BENDER PROFILES\nAlmost 100 different bender/pipe combinations included.  You have the ability to tweak or completely modify any of the combinations to match your bender on the field.\n\n+ WHO IS IT FOR?\nIf you consider yourself a craftsman that takes pride in his work, iBend Pipe is for you.  If other \"sparkies\" come to you when they have a difficult bend, this is for you.  If you want to have a smaller \"bone\"  pile, this is for you.  If you can write your name in conduit, this is for you.  From, a  1st year inside wireman apprentice to a seasoned “old timer” this app will save you time and material.\n\nInput fractions instead of converting to decimals and get results in fractions.\n\nThanks for all the great reviews, if you have any suggestions:\nsupport@ibendpipe.com"

      "label": "“The biggest software advance for writers since the word processor.” —Michael Marshall Smith, bestselling author\n\nTypewriter. Ring-binder. Scrapbook. Scrivener combines all the writing tools you need to craft your first draft, from nascent notion to final full stop.\n\nTailor-made for creating long manuscripts, Scrivener banishes page fright by allowing you to compose your text in any order, in sections as large or small as you like. Got a great idea but don’t know where it fits? Write when inspiration strikes and find its place later. Grow your manuscript organically, idea by idea.\n\nWhether you plan or plunge, Scrivener works your way: meticulously outline every last detail first, or hammer out a complete draft and restructure later. Or do a bit of both. All text sections in Scrivener are fully integrated with its outlining tools, so working with an overview of your manuscript is only ever a tap away, and turning Chapter Four into Chapter One is as simple as drag and drop.\n\nNeed to refer to research? In Scrivener, your background material is always at hand. Write a description based on a photograph. Reference a video or PDF. Check for consistency with an earlier chapter. On the iPad, open two documents side-by-side; on the iPhone, flip between research and writing with just two taps.\n\nOnce you’re ready to share your work with the world, simply compile everything into a single document for printing, or export to popular formats such as Word, PDF, Final Draft or plain text. You can even share using different formatting, so that you can write in your favorite font and still keep your editor happy.\n\n\nFEATURES\n\nGet Started\n• Interactive tutorial project\n• Keep each manuscript and supporting materials in a self-contained project\n• Import Word, RTF, Final Draft and plain text files\n• Easily split imported text into separate sections\n\nGet Writing\n• Write your manuscript in sections of any size\n• View all sections as a single text using the “Draft Navigator” (iPad only)\n• Quickly navigate sections using the “binder” sidebar\n• Format with fonts and presets\n• Comments, footnotes, links and highlights\n• Simple bullets and lists\n• Insert images\n• Pinch-zoom to resize text\n• Full-screen mode (iPad only)\n• Typewriter scrolling mode keeps typed text center-screen (iPad only)\n• Write a screenplay using scriptwriting mode\n• Live word and character counts\n• Set word and character count targets\n• Find and replace\n• Customizable keyboard row provides quick-access buttons for formatting, navigation and punctuation\n• Comprehensive keyboard shortcuts for external keyboard users\n• Dark mode\n\nFind Your Structure\n• Write in any order and reorganize later\n• Write a synopsis for any text section and see it in the outline\n• Expand, collapse and drill down into sections of your project\n• Rearrange sections as index cards on the corkboard (iPad only)\n• Project-wide search\n• Track ideas using labels and status\n• Apply custom icons to your sections\n\nRefer to Research\n• Import research material such as image, PDF and media files\n• View research files or other sections right alongside your writing (iPad only)\n• Every section has its own notes area for jotting down ideas\n• Supports multi-tasking split screen mode (supported devices only)\n\nShare Your Work\n• Compile to a single document for sharing or printing\n• Use different formatting in your exported or printed document\n• Export to Word, RTF, Final Draft, PDF or plain text\n• Convert rich text to Markdown for sharing with Markdown apps\n• Create and email zipped backups of your projects\n\nWork Anywhere\n• Use Dropbox to sync between devices and with the macOS and Windows versions of Scrivener*\n• Copy projects between devices via iTunes\n\n* Requires a Dropbox account (not compatible with iCloud).\n\nSUPPORT\nYou can contact us at ios.support@literatureandlatte.com, visit our forums at http://www.literatureandlatte.com/forum, or find us @scrivenerapp on Twitter."

      "label": "Due remembers all the things that you need so you don't have to.\n\nBecause it repeatedly reminds you of things until you act on them, it‘s impossible to forget anything.\n\nMost importantly, it's lightning-fast to set and postpone reminders, all thanks to a clever time picker and natural date parsing.\n\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\n1. Persistent & Effective\nAuto Snooze repeatedly* notifies you of missed reminders until marked done or rescheduled. Choose between intervals of every 1, 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 minutes.\n\n2. Fast to Set, Fast to Postpone\nA time picker with 12 preset and fully customizable times lets you set due dates and postpone reminders in record time.\n\n3. Natural Date & Time Parsing\nDue can also parse dates and times that you typed or dictate and offer to set the due dates and times for you.\n\n4. Countdown Timers\nPrecise to the second, perfect for making the perfect soft-boiled eggs, brewing your coffee and more. Set them up once and reuse them forever\n\n5. Powerful Recurring Reminders\nFrom the simple daily and weekly reminders to the complex every-3rd-Wednesday-of-the-month kind of reminders\n\n6. Keep in Sync**\nUse iCloud or Dropbox to keep your reminders and timers in sync across your iPhone, iPad and Mac.\n\n7. Works Offline, Completely Private\nThere is no account to sign up for. We don't store, and we can't access your reminders and timers. And you don't need internet to receive reminders.\n\n8. Accessible to Everyone\nAutomatically adjusts text size according to your system setting, and offers full VoiceOver support. Due is also localized in 17 languages.\n\n\n* By default, auto snooze repeats 5 times, and can be configured to repeat up to 10 times. Due can auto snooze any overdue items indefinitely when you launch Due or act on any of its notifications.\n** Sync on Mac requires Due for Mac (sold separately)\n\n\nWHAT'S THAT IN-APP PURCHASE ABOUT?\n\nWhen you purchase Due today, you will have access to every feature in the app today—no further purchase required.\n\nYou will also get access to all new features released one year from your date of purchase.\n\nThe optional Due Upgrade Pass subscription allows you to continue getting access to all new features released one year *after* your date of purchase.\n\nAnd here's the deal: Every feature that you have unlocked will remain available to you, forever—even if you stop subscribing.\n\nEven without a subscription, you'll always receive bug-fix and compatibility updates for free. These updates add support for the latest iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches. They also help ensure that Due continues to function well on the latest versions of iOS, iPadOS and watchOS.\n\nDue has a pretty good track record with that.\n\nTo illustrate: If you've purchased Due back in 2010 for your iPhone 3G running iOS 4, that very same app in 2022 is now optimized for iPhone 14 Pro Max running iOS 16. It even works on devices that didn't exist back then, such as the iPad Pro and the Apple Watch.\n\nTERMS & PRIVACY POLICY\n\nOur terms of use and privacy policy is available here: https://www.dueapp.com/terms.html\n\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\n\nDue requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad running iOS 12 or later."

The Do Less To-Do List\n\nBento helps you do less, but more meaningful tasks.\nWe all have plenty of to-dos on our list and our mission is to reduce task overwhelm to maximize achievement.\n\nBento doesn't replace your to-do list, it complements it!\nOne of the biggest productivity issues is prioritization - so we've limited you to 3 tasks per Bento box.\n\n---\n\nSo, how does Bento work?\n\nTASK LIMITS\n\nBento limits you to 3 tasks per box - to help you do less, but more meaningful to-dos. We limit how many boxes you can open to 7 boxes in total, to help you plan only what is most important. Our mission is to reduce task overwhelm to maximize achievement.\n\nSMALL, MEDIUM & LARGE TASKS\n\nMuch like a box for sushi, Bento allows you to create small, medium, and large tasks helping you to organize your tasks in sizeable chunks for better completion. The best productivity experts recommend reducing your workload for better per-task performance.\n\n3 ENERGY-BASED WORKFLOWS\n\nOnce you have your 3 priority tasks. We've created 3 workflows, Eat That Frog, Climb The Summit, and the Slow Burn to help you best order your day for success and energy.\n\nSINGLE-TASK FOCUS MODE\n\nTo truly focus, we need fewer distractions. Blocking out attention to focus on just your key task can make a huge difference. Inside Bento, we have a single-task focus mode combined with a countdown timer for deep focus work states.\n\nDARK & LIGHT MODE\n\nEach box can be customized with an emoji alongside stunningly animated themes. Each theme has a light mode and dark mode, for optimal productivity.\n\n6 BEAUTIFULLY ANIMATED THEMES\n\nRelaxing Japanese-themed backgrounds for a soothing way to handle your most meaningful tasks.\n\n---\n\nBento can be used in a variety of ways, here are a few recommendations:\n\n- Create a daily Bento to plan your 3 priority tasks\n- Plan the full week by adding up to 7 Bento boxes\n- Build a week, month, and yearly goals list for planning ahead\n\nThe Bento app is the best and most effective place to implement the Bento Methodology, a new mindful way to approach task management. Bento is now optimised for iPad as part of a single universal app for all your iOS devices.\n\n---\n\nQUESTIONS\n\nReach out on Twitter @BentoMethod or email bento@keepproductive.com for any help.\n\nPRIVACY POLICY\n\nFind the full privacy policy here: https://www.bentomethod.com/privacy"

      "label": "First released in 2009, GoodReader® is truly a veteran of the App Store.\n\nIn the modern app business, it's not easy to stay relevant that long. We're proud to say that after 13 years and counting, we've been delivering wonderful updates with extraordinary new features. And we're going to keep doing that!\n\nGoodReader is a perfect combination of document-reading and file-managing capabilities. It's your one-stop shop for all your document needs on your iOS device.\n\nUse the app once, and you'll be hooked. Soon you'll be wondering how you ever managed to work without it.\n\n-= File Reading =-\nPDF, TXT, MS Office, iWork, HTML, pictures, music & audio-books, videos. This is what you can view in GoodReader, plus you can also annotate PDF files and edit TXT files.\n\n-= PDF Reading and Annotating =-\nPDF files is where GoodReader truly shines. Reading experience is so superior, it's hard to describe. To rephrase one of our customers' review, \"try it, and you'll see.\" While you're at it, give our PDF Reflow feature a try. You'll be surprised how much better PDF reading goes when you don't have to scroll left/right all the time, for every single line of text.\nAnnotating PDFs is another star feature of our app. Adding notes and drawings, highlighting text, and then sharing your annotated files or annotation summaries will be your main productivity and collaboration asset.\n\n-= File Management =-\nWhile reading files is a big part of GoodReader, it's not all it can do. It can also serve as a central hub for all your files, even those that can't be opened by GoodReader itself. It's like bringing your personal computer experience to your mobile device — easily managing huge collections of files and folders will make you forget you don't have your laptop around.\n\n-= Connecting =-\nDropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive, Box.com, WebDAV, SMB, AFP, FTP, SFTP — these are all accessible from inside GoodReader. Download, upload, and sync (*) individual files or huge folder collections.\n\n-= Security =-\nWith GoodReader, your data security steps up to the level previously only dreamt of. With Pro Pack® (*), our new set of professional-level super-features, you'll get AES-256, a military-grade encryption, for all your data, at a price of a cup of coffee! And it's completely independent from the built-in Apple's Data Protection, so even if a hacker steals and unlocks your device, your data will still be protected by another strong layer of security, our own.\n\n-= Split-Screen =-\nThis wonderful feature allows you to split (*) an iPad screen in half, to read two files side-by-side. And even two different parts of the same file!\n\n(*): This feature requires a subscription to Pro Pack®, sold separately from inside the app as an in-app purchase."

      "label": "\"Oblique Strategies\" is a concept developed by Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt to help artists overcome creative blocks through lateral thinking. It consists of a deck of cards, each one containing a vague or ambiguous phrase that can be used to solve a problem intuitively, by breaking conventional thinking patterns and interpreting it from a new perspective.\n\nThis app aims to translate the essence of the original cards deck into a digital experience, making it accessible to a wider audience. It contains the original edition, as well as the newer decks, presenting them in a sleek minimalist style inspired by the original design of the cards. The user interface is simple and straightforward, built to encourage creative or design thinking without distracting from the process. The home screen widget on iOS 14 allows reading a new quote every day without opening the application. The Apple Watch version can run independently without needing the app installed on your iPhone.\n\nWith VoiceOver, anyone with a visual impairment can have the Oblique Strategies phrase read to them. Long tap the screen to have the last sentence read to you again. Also, you can shake the iPhone for a new sentence."

      "label": "Sectograph is a visual day planner that displays your calendar events on a pie chart in the form of a 12/24 hour clock face. It's a different way of looking at the day\n\nHOW IT WORKS\n\nThe visual planner works like an analog clock widget. It automatically receives all the calendar events and overlays them on the 12/24 hour dial. This provides a different, more efficient view of your schedule.\n\nHOW IT LOOKS\n\nIt looks like a projection of your calendar of events onto a 12-hour dial that has hour and minute hands just like a regular watch.\nEvent sectors are displayed in those hour intervals in which they will occur.\nThe interval of idle time between events is displayed between sectors, as well as the time from an hour hand to the start of each event.\nEvents are displayed automatically 12/24 hours ahead of time.\n\nThe calendar and analog clock, combined, give a visual representation of your busyness, allow you to effectively plan and calculate daytime.\n\nUse a widget for better integration.\n\nAREAS OF APPLICATION\n\n• Day scheduling and timing. Conveniently track your daily tasks, meetings, events and at any time know how much time is left to wait until the end of the current event and until the start of the next. Don't be late.\n\n• Accounting and control of working hours. Keep your phone in your workplace and you will be completely under control.\n\n• Class schedule. Observe how much time is left before the end of a tiresome lecture at the university and never be late for laboratory work.\n\n• Schedule of the day. Follow your daily routine and get better, just use the app to keep track of your to-dos and daily tasks. Take rest breaks in time!\n\n• Trip timer and flight duration. Are you losing the passage of time due to endless travel and flights? Control check-in time, boarding time and flight duration. Keep everything under control.\n\n• Make your meal, medication, and exercise schedule clearer. Lead the right lifestyle and be healthy!\n\n• Convenient countdown to scheduled events in the app and widget. The plan of the day will be executed exactly.\n\n• The app may appeal to fans of Pomodoro and Chronodex timer technologies. Time tracking with him will happen in a new way."

By recording your cues lines, you practice listening for them right along with recalling your own. \n\nOnce you have a scene set up, save time by rehearsing while doing other activities. Combining other tasks with rehearsal enables deeper memorization of your lines and often provides a few unexpected insights to your character. \n\nGetting started is easy. Simply create a production, add characters, then start recording your character's spoken and cue lines. Record the full lines for your scene partners or just the cue lines. Then start rehearsing!\n\nChoose the character you wish to rehearse by muting them during playback and enjoy your own portable scene partner. Rehearse around the house or on the go, rehearse while driving or doing chores. It’s that easy! \n\nFeatures \n\n- Dress rehearsal mode!\n- Line prompting to speed memorization.\n- Streamlined recording interface.\n- Lock screen audio controls integration.\n- Great for single scene and full length productions.\n- Shared character lists for productions.\n- Streamlined scene screen enables playback and recording from one screen. \n- Playback all scene lines or mute a character to rehearse lines from memory.\n- Drag and drop line reordering.\n- Auto-save recordings for fast scene creation.\n- Headphone and bluetooth support for limitless rehearsal opportunities."

      "label": "Hang-a-Pic greatly simplifies the tedious and sometimes difficult task of hanging multiple, equally aligned pictures, mirrors, decorative plates, candles or any other wall mounted ornaments. Of course, hanging one picture is simple. But if you have three or four pictures, each with two hooks on the back, and you want them exactly 6 inches apart, and aligned correctly across your wall? Hang-a-Pic will do just that!\n\nUsing a very friendly walk-through interface, Hang-a-Pic can tell you exactly where to put your nails (or wall-plugs, etc.) in the wall for each picture or ornament. No more headaches or extra holes in the wall from guessing where the nails should go... All you need is a tape measure and Hang-a-Pic will figure out the rest!\n\nIt's so easy that a 12 year old child could take four pictures, each with two hooks on the back, and hang them precisely and evenly across a wall the first time! No extra holes, no \"oops!!\".\n\n- New Features added to support hanging a group of pictures (or anything else) with different frame widths, evenly spaced across a wall. For example, say you're hanging 3 pictures and the center picture is wider than the other 2, Hang-a-Pic will now make this an easy task to pinpoint exactly where your nails need to be for each picture! \n- Now supports as many as 5 pictures (or any thing else you're hanging), and each can be a different width. And they do *not* need to be hung symmetrically! \n- Send measurements to your Email address.\n- Print the measurements to your AirPrint compatible Printer.\n- Performance enhancements.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: Hang-a-Pic does not calculate how high you wish to hang pictures, mirrors, etc.. Some prefer staggering the height of each picture, some prefer hanging them all the same height. The height you wish to hang pictures is your particular visual preference. For example, do want them at eye-level or higher up on a wall with very tall ceilings? etc.. It's up to you. Hang-a-Pic will however, calculate perfect spacing between those pictures horizontally."

There is a lot of swearing. Really so very much swearing. Please do not buy this app and then be shocked by the swearing, because there is a lot of it, and here we are, telling you about it right up front. \n\nIf traditional housekeeping isn’t really your style, but your living space needs a little attention, UfYH’s challenges and customizable features will help you get your place back in shape, a few minutes at a time. Rather than encourage marathon cleaning sessions, UfYH gives you the tools to clean up, a little at a time. Unf&%*ing your habitat turns dreaded chores into easy-to-complete tasks, with a hefty dose of “filthy” language to motivate you to clean up.\n\n    -Clean and simple easy-to-use interface.\n    -Select timed challenges in 5, 10, or 20 minute intervals and try to beat the clock to finish the challenge.\n    -Select challenges by room.\n    -Create a customized to-do list and reminders to keep you on schedule.\n    -Earn achievements for completing challenges or finishing your to-do list.\n    -Use the 20/10 timer to reward yourself with a 10-minute break for every 20 minutes of work. Shorter challenges count cumulatively toward your total time.\n    -Random motivators remind you that excuses are boring and use a combination of a little guilt, a little shame, and a little swearing to get you moving. \n\nUfYH is especially useful for those who don’t have a lot of spare time to devote to cleaning: students, people with full-time jobs, people with roommates, anyone who can’t find the motivation to get up and just do something. Even if it’s just a little something! Our lives are complicated and messy, and we’re often overwhelmed and distracted, and sometimes a little lazy. Unf&%* things and see a remarkable difference in how you tackle cleaning.\n\nUfYH uses frequent profanity and is for mature audiences. In-app, the word \"filth\" is replaced by its older, more foul-mouthed cousin. This app uses the \"f-word.\" A lot. Please be aware of this before purchasing."

TaskTask directly connects with your Office 365 Business, Exchange on-premises, or Google tasks to keep your full task list in sync between Outlook and your device. Everything is tracked, include all the advanced properties you can see in Outlook. Best of all TaskTask includes flagged items (email!) so you can see your complete task list on the go.\n\nUsing TaskTask, you can manage your to-do list, create tasks, set start/due dates, mark complete, assigning categories, change importance, set and receive reminders, and delete tasks. An Exchange Server or Office 365 account is required to synchronized tasks with Outlook. No additional software is necessary. TaskTask works with Gmail directly, although in a limited fashion.\n\nKey Features:\n- Simple interface, quickly create new tasks and mark tasks completed\n- Set task attributes, such as category, importance, start/due/complete dates, and notes\n- Synchronize your task list with your e-mail account (no hidden fees or software to download)\n- Quickly swipe to complete or delete a task \n- Easy set up with automatic configuration of your server\n- Drag-to-order your tasks, see the same order in Outlook\n- Recurring tasks and reminders\n- View attachments on your tasks and attach files from other apps\n\nHow is TaskTask better than Reminders?\n- See your task list how you prefer: organize by start date, due date, category, importance, or reminder date.\n- Reorder your tasks just by dragging them around\n- Full category support, including downloading your list of categories and colors from your Exchange Server.\n- See tasks in the same order as Outlook's To Do Bar\n- Task filters: filter out tasks in the future or tasks you don't want to see on your mobile device\n- Flagged mail items: See the full list of items from your To Do Bar, not just tasks\n- Quick Task Entry: Type a list of task subjects quickly in one space, and TaskTask automatically creates the set of tasks\n- Mark tasks as private: Hide tasks from others who have visibility to your task list\n\nNote: To synchronize your tasks with Outlook, your email account must be on a compatible Microsoft Exchange Server or Office 365 Business account. Microsoft Exchange Server 2010 and newer versions are supported, although there may be additional factors that prevent TaskTask from working with your server. \n\nIf you are using Mail.app or Microsoft Outlook 2011 (Macintosh) with your email account in \"Exchange\" mode, TaskTask is compatible with your server. Because there are specific requirements for your server, please verify with your e-mail administrator that your server meets these requirements before purchasing this app."

      "label": "Shift Worker is designed for people who need a quick and easy way to enter and view their shifts.\n\nA traditional calendar is not always ideal for shift workers. Sometimes it's not easy to see your upcoming shift schedule very clearly, especially if your shifts don't fall into the traditional working week. Shift Worker solves this problem and turns the frustrating task of entry into a quick and easy experience.\n\nShift Worker allows you to create your own types of shifts by combining visually-attractive icons with letters/numbers so that they can be easily identified at a glance. By including a range of icons (such as suns and stars for day and night shifts) in a variety of colors, any combination is possible for all types of shifts.\n\nEntering shifts can be done quickly by simply selecting a type of shift and tapping on each date it occurs. An entire month of shifts could be entered in seconds, an entire year in a few minutes!\n\nIn addition, Shift Worker allows you create multiple calendars to see friends and family shifts! You can send your shifts to others so they can also see your shifts at a glance as an image or in their copy of Shift Worker. To make things even simpler, you can even save your shifts to your iPhone/iPod's background so that referring to your upcoming shift schedule is as simple as picking up your iPhone/iPod. \n\nShift Worker also includes the ability to create colored personalized notes for each date. Notes can be used anytime additional information needs to be added to a date.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n- Create a virtually unlimited amount of shift types\n- Enter shifts on the calendar months in advance in seconds\n- Add your rotation and automatically fill the calendar in a few simple steps\n- Show friends and family shifts using multiple calendars\n- View the calendar in timeline format to see your shift flow at a glance\n- Create colored personalized notes for any date on the calendar\n- Include week of year or week 1/2 alternating pattern on calendar\n- Jump to any month by using the \"Goto\" button\n- Save a month's worth of shifts to your background\n- Share your shifts to others via email, MMS, Facebook or Twitter\n- Import other Shift Worker shifts and view them all within the one app\n- No in-app purchases!\n- No ads!"

      "label": "One evening, after a very long week of shows we were sat in the office looking at the show times wishing the running times would work them selves out (we've all been there), it was at this moment this show timing app was created. Welcome to the future of show timing without multiple stop watches and reminder alarms. Now you can start your show with the press of one button and the app does the rest. With unlimited Acts and Intervals in any configuration that you like! , just set your show structure, tell it your interval duration(s) and away you go. \n\nShow StopWatch also handles separate in act timers and show stops, adjusting the running and playing times accordingly! Once you have completed a show you can then email the times with a simple button press or copy them your clipboard as well as storing them for later. \n\nThere is also the option to have pre show notifications for back stage calls and the same again in the interval so you don't have to spend all your time looking at the clock. The app will also run in the back ground of your phone if for what ever reason you need to use your phone for something else (certainly not facebook, for those long scenes with no cues) while its running. \n\nThis app was created by stage managers for stage managers, it is currently being used by a number of productions and companies including UK Tours, West End shows and Repertory Theatres. It will continue to be a working development so any thing you come across that you think ‘it would be great if’ please don't hesitate to get in contact! It became apparent while testing how tiny details make a difference to everyone so we have tried to incorporate them all, for example; the interval timer shows both time elapsed and remaining, and is in green until you start over running when it goes red (because how often do you go up on time), and the ability to access times so far, for those quiet moments where you are able to start the show report early!\n\nThis app has not been made to replace your note book, still write times down if you get a chance, its simply to try and make life easier at the end of the show! Have a play, get to know it and let us know how you get on!\n\nIf you want to get in contact email me at jackrlord@gmail.com"

      "label": "HabitBoard is a simple and flexible habit tracker. It helps me to keep on track of my intentional habits, informs my decisions, and supports me at paying attention. I always wanted to build the habit tracker of my liking and this is it — and I hope you'll enjoy using it too!\n\n### Unlimited Habits\nIf you're just starting out with one or two habits or already have a long list of things you want to keep track of — HabitBoard imposes no limitations on the number of habits you can track.\n\n### Historic Data\nIt provides a detailed calendar-like view of your historic data which grows over time. In addition, you get habit-specific statistics like current and longest streaks, completion rate, and count by week, month, and year.\n\n### Statistics\nHabitBoard makes provides meaningful and beautiful stats that give an overview over all your tracked habits. You can inspect your overall weekly and monthly completions, get an overall completion rate, and keep track of your daily completions.\n\n### Weekly Goals and Skipped Days\nSome habits are not planned daily and HabitBoard makes it easy to configure automatically skipped days and weekly goals per habit. If you set a weekly goal, you'll see an additional label for the current progress in the habit list.\n\n### Customizable Colors\nEach habit can use colors according to your personal taste or for visual grouping of habits. You can customize both the colors for done and missed habit states.\n\n### Widgets\nHabitBoard offers new Lock Screen widgets and small, medium, and a large calendar-like widgets so that you can glance on your habits even if you're not using the app.\n\n### Shortcuts\nWith the \"Mark habit as done\" Shortcuts action, you can combine different tasks to automatically keep your HabitBoard up-to-date.\n\n### Archived Habits\nSome things also come to an end (or are paused), so HabitBoard offers a dedicated place for archived habits. Habits that live there are still fully interactive, so it can also be used as a more private area for certain habits.\n\n### Configuration of List Labels\nIn my own practice of habit tracking, I've noticed that the current streak is not always the most meaningful metric — personally, I focus more on monthly completions. With HabitBoard, you can decide whether you want to display the current streak, weekly, monthly, and yearly completions in addition to the names in the habit list.\n\n### Daily Reminder\nWhen you're starting out, a daily reminder can be useful. If you want, the app notifies you when it's time to review your HabitBoard for the day.\n\n### Automatic Backup and Sync\nHabitBoard securely and privately backups and syncs your habits via iCloud. If you're using a second device, your data is already there.\n\n---\n\nIf you have feedback, a bug report, or want to be a beta tester, feel free to reach out via any of the links under *Settings → About*.\n\nThanks for using HabitBoard!"

      "label": "Search by Image is a powerful browser extension for Safari that makes effortless reverse image searches possible, and comes with support for more than 30 search engines, such as Google, Bing, Yandex, Baidu and TinEye.\n\nSearch by Image is an open source project made possible thanks to a community of awesome supporters. By purchasing the extension on the App Store, you help support the continued development of the extension.\n\nThe extension helps journalists and researchers verify the authenticity of images, and assists in the identification of false information on social media. Search by Image is also popular among photographers, helping artists explore how their work is shared on the web, while shoppers find it valuable for discovering similar products at discounted prices.\n\nThe extension enables you to search for images from the browser menu with the help of a diverse set of reverse image search engines, which can be toggled and reordered from the extension's options. Visit the wiki for the full list of supported search engines.\n\nhttps://github.com/dessant/search-by-image/wiki/Search-engines\n\nPRO TIPS:\n  • Search with an image by sharing it from Files or Photos.\n  • Tap the Share button in the extension modal to extract an image from a web page and share it to other apps, such as Messages or Notes.\n\nYou may choose to allow the extension to run on every website, or grant access to the current website before a search. When you grant access only to the current website, access must also be granted to each search engine in order to view search results.\n\nImages positioned at the selected area are detected regardless of how they were embedded in the page. The extension also supports searching with images from your device, and images from private sites.\n\nA handful of search modes are offered that serve different use cases. The search mode can be configured from the extension's options.\n\nSearch modes:\n  • Select URL: select an image on the page and search with the image URL. This is the default search mode.\n  • Select image: select an image on the page and search with the image file. This search mode is preferred for sites which do not allow the direct linking of images, such as private sites.\n  • Browse: search with an image from your device. Pasting images from the clipboard is also supported.\n  • URL: search with an image URL.\n\nReviews are not monitored for bug reports, please visit the support page to report issues and submit feature requests."

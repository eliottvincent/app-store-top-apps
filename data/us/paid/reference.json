Quickly find rhymes, near rhymes (including slant rhymes), synonyms, antonyms, homophones, similar sounding words, words with the same consonant pattern, and other related words (generalizations, specializations, words appearing in the same context). Use Apple's local dictionaries or ours online if you are unsure of any meanings.\n\nYou get a database of over 150,000 words and phrases right at your fingertips. Find rhymes without an Internet connection, but if you are online, we'll connect you to RhymeZone.com for definitions and all the other great features you've come to love, ad-free! Or you can look it up on our sister site, OneLook.com, or even hear it pronounced with your device's built-in text-to-speech.\n\nThere's also a nifty \"Poet Maker\" feature, which lets you find words that match constraints on both rhyme and meaning at the same time. For example, suppose you want a word that rhymes with \"cat\" and means \"heavy\"; this feature will answer \"fat\" in no time. Or suppose you're looking for a rhyme of \"curious\" that means \"invalid\"; you'll get \"spurious\". You get the idea!\n\nSo whether you're aspiring to be the next Shakespeare, looking to put on the finishing touches of a love poem, bust out the next rap lyric, or just seeking some clever wordplay for your English assignment, give the app a try!"

Don’t postpone joy. Discover why SkySafari is the #1 recommended astronomy app for serious amateur astronomers since 2009.\n\nHere's what’s new in version 7:\n\n+ Complete support for iOS 15 and iPhone 13. Version 7 brings a new and immersive stargazing experience.\n\n+ Events Finder - go to the new Events section to unlock a powerful search engine that finds astronomical events visible tonight and far into the future. The finder dynamically generates a listing of moon phases, eclipses, planetary moon events, meteor showers and planetary phenomenon such as conjunctions, elongations and oppositions.\n\n+ Notifications - the notifications section has been completely revamped to allow you to customize and manage which events trigger an alert notification on your device.\n\n+ Telescope Support - telescope control is at the heart of SkySafari.  Version 7 takes a giant leap forward by supporting ASCOM Alpaca and INDI.  These next generation control protocols allow you to effortlessly connect to hundreds of compatible astronomical devices.\n\nStargazing is often done on your own but looking up at the stars reminds us that we are all part of a larger interconnected universe. SkySafari 7 brings social stargazing to mobile devices with two new features to help you connect with other like minded people.\n\nOneSky - allows you to see what other users are observing, in real time.  This feature highlights objects in the sky chart and indicates with a number how many users are observing a particular object.\n\nSkyCast - allows you to guide a friend or group around the night sky through their own copy of SkySafari. After initiating SkyCast, you can generate a link and conveniently share it with other SkySafari users via text message, apps or social media accounts.\n\n+ Sky Tonight -  jump to the new Tonight section to see what’s visible in your sky tonight.  Expanded information has been designed to help plan your night and includes  Moon & Sun info, calendar curations, events and the best positioned deep sky and solar system objects.\n\n+ Improved Observation Tools - SkySafari is the perfect tool to help you plan, record and organize your observations.  New workflows make it easier to add, search, filter and sort data.\n\nThe Small Touches:\n\n+ You can now edit the Jupiter GRS Longitude Value in the Settings.\n+ Better Moon Age calculation.\n+ New grid & reference options allow you to display Solstice and Equinox markers, Orbit + Node markers for all solar system objects, and tick marks and labels for the Ecliptic, Meridian, and Equator reference lines.\n+ Previous In-app Purchases are Now Free -  this includes the H-R diagram, 3D Galaxy view, and the PGC galaxy and GAIA star catalogs. Enjoy.\n+ Many more.\n\nIf you haven't used SkySafari 7 Pro before, here's what you can do with it:\n\n+ Hold your device up, and SkySafari 7 Pro will find stars, constellations, planets, and more! The star chart updates automatically with your movements for the ultimate stargazing experience.\n\n+ Simulate the night sky up to 100,000 years in the past or future! Animate meteor showers, conjunctions, eclipses, and other celestial events.\n\n+ Control your telescope, log and plan your observations.\n\n+ Optionally backup all of your observing data in our secure cloud storage and make it easily accessible to multiple devices as well as from our new web interface, LiveSky.com.\n\n+ Augmented Reality (AR) mode\n\n+ Night Vision.\n\n+ Orbit Mode. Leave the Earth’s surface behind, and fly through our solar system.\n\n+ Galaxy View shows the position of deep sky objects in our Milky Way!\n\n+ Much more!"

      "label": "This app is a recreation of the Noah Webster 1828 two-volume dictionary. Its intrinsic value will not only be of great interest to those studying American heritage and Christian studies, but also to writers and those exploring poetry.\n\nNoah Websters 1828 American Dictionary contains the greatest number of Biblical definitions given in any reference volume. It is an invaluable resource written when American values and patriotism were based on Christian values.\n\nOf interest to poets and writers, The Noah Webster dictionary was used extensively by Emily Dickinson. We know that she made frequent and extensive use of Noah Webster's American Dictionary of the English Language in writing her poems, paying attention not only to the definitions but also to Webster's etymologies and his illustrative quotations.\n\nBeing able to see how definitions have evolved today is fascinating, and a great resource when studying.\n\nYou can easily search or browse the entire dictionary and add favourites to revisit later.\n\nApp design by professional app developer NASDA Studios."

The app will calculate planetary hours for:\n\n1) Your current location, defined by GPS.\n2) Any of over 42,000 of predefined locations around the world from the database shipped with the app.\n3) Any custom location you might want to define, specifying its latitude and longitude.\n\nYou can select any date from January 1st, 1900. \n\nHours also displays an extensive list of attributes for each planet.\n\nIn addition, planetary strengths are calculated. Their importance was emphasized by the 17th century herbalists, as well as by contemporary practitioners.\n\nIn the latest version, a possibility to generate a notification when a particular hour starts was added. \n\nIf you want to learn more about the planetary hours, I've prepared for you a course, Planetary Hours: A Complete Guide (https://astroschool.lunarium.co.uk/p/planetary-hours-a-complete-guide)"

      "label": "The Lost Person Behavior App is based upon the Search and Rescue (SAR) international gold standard reference tool on where to look for lost and missing persons. Every Public Safety Official needs to know where the missing person might be, what to ask, where to look, and what to do when minutes matter. The app was built around the field needs of Public Safety Officials.  No matter how remote the location, the app continues to function since no network connection is required, once installed.\n\nThis life-saving information is customized for 41 different subject categories. The categories are organized into a hierarchy of groups including external factors (abductions, aircraft), water incidents (boats and persons in the water), wheeled incidents (ATV, mountain bikes, vehicles, etc.), mental states (autism, dementia, despondent, intellectual disability, mental illness, substance intoxication), children (in five different age groups), and eighteen outdoor activities (hiker, hunter, climber, gatherer, skier, etc.).\n\nThe app guides the user in selecting the correct subject category by several means. The subject category wizard allows the user to select potential scenarios and then will suggest the best match for the subject category.  For example, if a child was riding his bicycle and was then known to be abducted, the user could select Child, Wheel/Motorized, and Abduction; the wizard would suggest using the abduction category. Alternately, the user can go straight to a subject category by using favorites, an alphabetical list, or the hierarchy list. Once the subject category is selected, the Lost Person Behavior App provides the user with: \n•\tbehavioral profiles\n•\ttactical briefings\n•\tspecific investigative questions\n•\tspatial and survival statistics\n•\tsuggestions for initial tasks (reflex tasking).\n\nThe all-new tactical briefings distill the statistics and profiles to the key points that every field searcher must know. The more extensive profile, full statistics, and suggested initial tasks assist even the seasoned search planner. The highly detailed questions for the investigation resulted from decades of SAR experience and thousands of missions.\n\nThe app even allows you to email a checklist of these critical tasks and interview questions so that you may print them out.  The email could also be used for providing remote support or documenting tasks that have been completed.\n\nDetermining where to look is one of the major functions of the search statistics, which are now provided in a graphical and tabular format.  The statistics from thousands of SAR missions allow the search planner to see where similar previous search subjects were found. The SAR statistics include:\n•\tDistance from the Initial Planning Point\n•\tElevation model (likelihood of going up, down, or staying at the same elevation)\n•\tMobility model (how long will the subject keep moving)\n•\tDispersion angle (given a direction of travel, how well does that predict subject’s location)\n•\tTrack Offset model (how far away from a feature such as a road or trail is subject found)\n•\tFind location (at what type of geographic feature was the subject found)\n•\tScenario (what caused the subject to become missing)\n•\tSurvivability overall (what is the overall chance of finding the subject alive or injured)\n•\tSurvivability rate (how does survivability rate change in 24-hour increments).\n\nThe Lost Person Behavior App can be easily customized to only show the statistical information you actually need. The user can customize for ecoregion, terrain, and urban incidents. The user can view the data in both metric and English units. Several additional helpful tools are built into the app. Contextual help is provided on every page with additional information boxes, which explain every element of the app on the page you need.  The information page provides information about the bike wheel model used to describe initial tactical deployment (reflex tasking), a glossary, help, and contact information."

      "label": "HORSE SIDE VET GUIDE IS THE MOST HIGHLY RATED HORSE HEALTH APP AVAILABLE!   - Do you have questions about your horse’s health? Search for answers in HSVG, a massive & constantly growing database of equine health info – conveniently available to you “horse side.” \n\nHSVG was created by Doug Thal DVM DABVP, a lifelong horseman & veterinarian that has practiced exclusively equine veterinary medicine for over 20 years & is board certified in equine practice.  \n\nHSVG provides helpful information about equine health from the moment you notice a problem with your horse - My Observation.  It contains practical advice, suggested skills, and questions to discuss with your vet.\n\nHSVG is of value in an emergency and non-emergency, and it helps you distinguish between the two. HSVG also contains dozens of high quality instructional videos, and other media designed to enable you to become an active participant in ensuring your horse’s good health.  \n\nHowever, HSVG is not structured as a simple decision tree that takes you down a singular path based on your input. It is not a substitute for your local equine veterinarian. It does not, and cannot, anticipate and address all of the subtle variations and unique circumstances associated with your horse’s health. That is your veterinarian's job.\n__________________________\n\n- Make better decisions about your horse’s health.\n- Increase the quality of communication between you and your vet.\n- Follow a logical thought process for addressing any equine heath care problem.\n- Utilize a quality alternative to Dr. Google.\n\nOk – so what is Horse Side Vet Guide exactly? \n\nHSVG is a custom-built relational database of equine health information that contains concise information about common problems to rare diseases.  Records are contained in 1 of 9 categories:\n\n- My Observations\n- Vet Diagnostics\n- Vet Diagnoses\n- Vet Treatments\n- My Skills\n- My Supplies\n- Terms & Topics\n- Media\n- Outside Resources\n\nThese records are extensively interlinked, providing a uniquely contextualized approach to any equine health issue. \n\nWe continuously add and update the records in HSVG. We have placed great emphasis on completing the MY OBSERVATIONS records first. You can find \"full access\" records with a keyword search, in the alphabetical browse lists, and hyperlinked inside other records. Incomplete (or \"partial access\") records are listed inside full access records, with no hyperlink. Many other records are hidden from view, and will be available later. After we complete a partial or hidden record we change it to \"full access\" and it becomes immediately available to you after the app has been synchronized to your mobile device. \n\nPlease see our website www.horsesidevetguide.com for more information about this application."

With the aid of it, you can easily find out, which tones will create the most advantageous composition. Using such schemes you can readily combine from 2 to 4 colors in solving a variety of problems connected with pictorial art, photography and even interior decoration. \nThis application will let you work wisely and efficiently with the color palette using six different schemes. Based on the contrasts or, on the contrary, on the law of assimilation, they let you introduce harmony into any artistic solutions, choose the necessary color and detach the predominant hue."

Sort by song style to compare birds that hoot and coo, with birds with high pitched songs, or you might like to sort the birds by commonness, so you can listen to the most common ones first, then move on to less frequent backyard visitors. More advanced birders may like to listen to birds from a particular habitat, such as forest or freshwater for example. You can make lists of your favourites so that you can find them quickly.\n\nUse the quiz to test your memory. Answer fast to earn a score multiplier and get on the high score table. Experienced birders can use the custom quiz to help distinguish and learn similar songs. \n\nAnd when you need a rest, try the slideshow feature - choose which birds to include, maybe add background bird song, then simply relax. If you want to continue learning while you relax, switch the voiceover on and hear the name of the bird announced at the end of each clip. This is also a good way of competing with the family - who can say the name of the bird first?\n\nBird names are included in Spanish and French.\n\nProblems? Email us: spiny@spinysoftware.com"

      "label": "Strong's Concordance, is a concordance of the King James Bible (KJV) that was constructed under the direction of Dr. James Strong (1822–1894) and first published in 1890.\n\nA concordance lets the reader directly compare how the same word may be used else where in the Bible. In this way the Strong's Concordance provides an independent check against translations, and offers an opportunity for greater, and more technically accurate understanding of the Bible text.\n\nWant to see it in action before you buy? Try Strong's Concordance Lite which provides a 100% functional demo of Matthew and Genesis.\n\nThis program does not require internet access, everything you need is all stored on the iDevice.\n\nFeatures:\n* Search for English words, and lookup Greek/Hebrew dictionaries.\n* Proper concordance, listing how the word was translated in other bible verses.\n* Full King James Text is included\n* Click on any blue word for concordance text.\n* Night mode for those that like to read at night (White on black)\n* iPad support\n\nPlease note: This version is not an \"exhaustive\" concordance, and does skip smaller words such as \"and, or, the, a\" as well as some other words. Though we think you'll find it has most (if not all) the words you'll ever need.\n\nWe're open to suggestions for improvement in future versions. Send comments and suggestions to strongs at orionsys.org."

Quick access to features like your equipment, observing sites, lists, and observations make it easy and enjoyable to get out, observe, and record your observations. The observing sessions feature lets you collect your observations into groups that span a few hours, or a few nights.\n\n6) Graph It. The completely new graph tool will give a quick visual representation of an object’s altitude above the horizon. Essential for planning your night’s observations.\n\n7) Plan It. Make the most of your time under the stars. Our updated planner is a powerful tool that lets you create a list of targets for your observing session with filters like object types, specific time ranges, constellation, catalog, and more. Plan it and get more done.\n\n8) Say It. Ever just wanted to just yell at your device and tell it what to do!? SkySafari 6 adds basic voice control for a wide range of operations. Say “select Jupiter,” “search for Titan,” “center on Polaris” and SkySafari will do the work for you. Yelling optional. \n\n9) Tilt It. Every old astronomy app these days lets your tilt and pan your device to show different parts of the sky, but who else lets you control your telescope that way!? “Tilt to slew” is an optional mode allowing you to keep your eye in the eyepiece, and, using the accelerometers in your device, gently translate the movements of your hands into smooth telescope motion.\n\n10) Share It. SkySafari 6 is more than just a mobile app, it’s a new system to help organize and share your observing experiences. With a free signup, you can see and share your observing data from our web portal, LiveSky.com! Affordable premium memberships add online editing, so you can not only view, but edit your observations, add new observing sites, manage your equipment and more. Finally, (coming soon) you can view, edit and manage your settings files with SkySafari Web, our fully functional web version.\n\nIf you haven't used SkySafari 6 Pro before, here's what you can do with it:\n\n• Hold your device up, and SkySafari 6 Pro will find stars, constellations, planets, and more! The star chart updates automatically with your movements for the ultimate stargazing experience.\n\n• Simulate the night sky up to 10,000 years in the past or future! Animate meteor showers, conjunctions, eclipses, and other celestial events.\n\n• Control your telescope, log and plan your observations.\n\n• Night Vision.\n\n• Orbit Mode. Leave the Earth’s surface behind, and fly through our solar system.\n\n• Galaxy View shows the position of deep sky objects in our Milky Way!\n\n• Much more!"

      "label": "*** Planning to go bird watching in Colombia? Then this is the app for you. This app fills a gap in the region and is the only serious bird app available for Colombia. It is based on the renowned reference work of the Helm Guide Series \"Birds of Northern South America\" by Robin Restall, Clemencia Rodner, and Miguel Lentino. The creation of apps from the book is a co-production between Bloomsbury Plc. and Sunbird Images. The app contains 5,600 illustrations and more than 4,000 bird songs and calls in total. *** \n\n*** Dutch Birding Journal writes: \n\n\"Would I recommend this app to anyone going on a birding trip to Colombia or one of the other countries in Northern South America? For sure! ..., you will be provided with a load of information, a nearly complete set of bird sounds and a few useful tools and features for use in the field for relatively low money.\" ***\n\n\nThis app is part of the Sunbird Images BLUE LABEL series. Our BLUE LABEL series are top notch digital field guides which provide the most comprehensive data available for a region or taxon. They stand for completeness including even the very rare species and vagrants which have only been recorded once or a few times in a region. Even the rare species are illustrated and described in detail featured with a full species account.\n\nNo other bird app for this region offers the following:\n\n- Includes all 1,889 Colombian bird species including all vagrants\n- 5,600 illustrations from the Helm Guide Series \"Birds of Northern South America\" \n- Covers all subspecies + geographic, age and sex variations\n- 4,054 bird songs and calls\n- Most advanced Compare Mode of any bird app - compare up to 16 species images / songs / maps\n- Spectrograms of all songs + details where songs were recorded\n- Introduction contains hints and links on bird watching in Colombia\n- Detailed distribution maps of Northern South America down to subspecies level\n- Create sighting lists on a map via GPS and sort by place, date, group, and name\n- Make notes for each bird spotted\n- A simple identification key narrows species down \n- Sort and display species: A–Z, 6 different languages, taxonomic\n\nColombia is the “Land of Birds” with vast natural richness and a number of natural superlatives. With its nearly 1,900 species it covers about 20 % of the world's bird species population with 78 endemic species covered in this app. \n\nChoose between 6 bird name languages: \nEnglish, Spanish, French, Dutch, German, Latin\n\nNarrow species down by foot colour, bill shape, tail length etc. leading to the bird searched for plus a choice of similar species. You can also look for fragments of a species name – the search for “finch“ shows all the species which include the word “finch“ in the species’ name.\n\n***A graphically well-designed layout – easy to use with large lettering.*** \n\n\"All Birds Colombia\" is very well suited for keeping personalised bird watch lists.\n\nThe app will continuously be developed further. All updates are free of charge. Once downloaded no internet connection needed – just download the app and start birding!\n\nVisit our internet support site for more information www.sunbird.tv.

It also includes tables to calculate the amount of oil or gas to add to an existing premix to change it to another ratio. To use:\n• Tap the table most applicable to your search,\n• Scroll to find your desired value,\n• View the calculated value. Done!\n\nUseful for:\nTwo-stroke (two-cycle) engines that require the user to premix the gas with a specific amount of oil. Given a ratio of gas to oil, the user needs to calculate the amount of oil to be added to the amount of gas they have. \nMany applications, including: Golf carts, Motorcycles, Snowmobiles, Blowers, Chainsaws, Tillers, Rotary plows, Utility Tractors, Garden tools, Motorscooters, some Genetators, Marine Outboard motors.\nUsers needing to change an exsiting premix from one ratio to another i.e. if they have two two-stroke engines that require different gas-to-oil ratios. If one of those engines runs out of fuel, then in order to make the correct gas/oil mix for that engine, a calculation will need to be done to work out how much oil or gas needs to be added. \n\nIncrements & Accuracy \n• Tap the bottom bar buttons to choose alternative increments (e.g. 1 gal, 0.1 gal, 0.01 gal). \n• The table defaults to the largest increment available. \n\nMore Units \n• Some tables have too many 'to' units to fit in the iPhone portrait position. Rotate your iPhone to the landscape position to show more conversion units (where available). \n\nBroad Categories \n• Create Premix with US, UK and Metric volumes of gas, with various ratios.\n• Change Ratios of US, UK and Metric volumes of gas, to a range of new ratios.\n\nSpecific Units Included \n• US Fluid Ounces, Gallons \n• UK Fluid Ounces, Gallons \n• Milliliters, Litres \n\nUniversal App \nThis means you only need to buy it once to be able to install it on all your devices (iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad). \n\nIf you find this app useful, please leave a review on the App Store. \n\nIf you have suggestions, feature requests, or need support, feel free to contact us through the Settings menu within our apps."

This app is perfect for catechism students who have trouble remembering all of their prayers, or for your own personal daily worship.  With all of the Rosary prayers from the official Vatican website inside, and the easy to use controls, you can view each daily prayer in one of four display styles. Adjust the font size to accommodate your visual preference.\n\nAs you make your way through the daily prayers, inspirational background music (choose either In His Time or Ave Maria) puts you in the right frame of mind for meditation. Each mystery is depicted in living color with beautiful pictures, or, if you prefer, you can add pictures from your personal photo album as well. This gorgeous art work is accompanied by Bible passages to help you reflect more deeply on each event. However, if you have a scripture which is a personal favorite, you can add your own text. \n\nMake your Holy Rosary Deluxe more personal by changing the beads to the color of your choice. Also you are able to choose how to progress through the prayer beads. Touch the current bead, and it will highlight and enlarge for prayer, or tap the arrow to move to the next bead. Each prayer bead is marked with a number so you can easily monitor your progress through the Rosary. \n\nThis app even remembers where you stopped during your last prayer and resumes where you left off when you return. If you accidentally skip ahead, you can easily go back to the proper bead to finish your prayer. When you're praying the new Novena feature, you can turn the Divine Mercy Chaplet on or off. The choice is yours.\n\nHoly Rosary Deluxe is the most versatile prayer app on the market, today. Everything you need is in one convenient place, so you can pray the Rosary where and when you choose.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n- Choose from four different display styles to pray the Holy Rosary and the Chaplet.\n- Each mystery has an image that helps to reflection of his events. Also this images can view in full screen.\n- There is a scripture for each mystery that helps you to meditate about the Jesus christ life.\n- Background music: 'Ave Maria' and 'In His Time'.\n- You can add pictures to the Rosary with your library.\n- You can edit the text for each prayer of the Holy Rosary.\n- You can edit the four themes:\n   - Colors\n   - Buttons\n   - Beads\n   - Crosses\n   - Virgins\n- Remember the mystery and the prayers that have been prayed the last time.\n- The Novena gives you the option to pray with the Chaplet or without it."

Don’t postpone joy. Discover why SkySafari is the #1 recommended astronomy app for serious amateur astronomers since 2009.\n\nHere's what’s new in version 7:\n\n+ Complete support for iOS 15 and iPhone 13. Version 7 brings a new and immersive stargazing experience.\n\n+ Events Finder - go to the new Events section to unlock a powerful search engine that finds astronomical events visible tonight and far into the future.

SkySafari 7 brings social stargazing to mobile devices with two new features to help you connect with other like minded people.\n\nOneSky - allows you to see what other users are observing, in real time.  This feature highlights objects in the sky chart and indicates with a number how many users are observing a particular object.\n\nSkyCast - allows you to guide a friend or group around the night sky through their own copy of SkySafari. After initiating SkyCast, you can generate a link and conveniently share it with other SkySafari users via text message, apps or social media accounts.\n\n+ Sky Tonight -  jump to the new Tonight section to see what’s visible in your sky tonight.  Expanded information has been designed to help plan your night and includes  Moon & Sun info, calendar curations, events and the best positioned deep sky and solar system objects.\n\n+ Improved Observation Tools - SkySafari is the perfect tool to help you plan, record and organize your observations.  New workflows make it easier to add, search, filter and sort data.\n\nThe Small Touches:\n\n+ You can now edit the Jupiter GRS Longitude Value in the Settings.\n+ Better Moon Age calculation.\n+ New grid & reference options allow you to display Solstice and Equinox markers, Orbit + Node markers for all solar system objects, and tick marks and labels for the Ecliptic, Meridian, and Equator reference lines.\n+ Previous In-app Purchases are Now Free -  this includes the H-R diagram, 3D Galaxy view, and the PGC galaxy and GAIA star catalogs. Enjoy.\n+ Many more.\n\nIf you haven't used SkySafari 7 Pro before, here's what you can do with it:\n\n+ Hold your device up, and SkySafari 7 Pro will find stars, constellations, planets, and more! The star chart updates automatically with your movements for the ultimate stargazing experience.\n\n+ Simulate the night sky up to 100,000 years in the past or future! Animate meteor showers, conjunctions, eclipses, and other celestial events.\n\n+ Control your telescope, log and plan your observations.\n\n+ Optionally backup all of your observing data in our secure cloud storage and make it easily accessible to multiple devices as well as from our new web interface, LiveSky.com.\n\n+ Augmented Reality (AR) mode\n\n+ Night Vision.\n\n+ Orbit Mode. Leave the Earth’s surface behind, and fly through our solar system.\n\n+ Galaxy View shows the position of deep sky objects in our Milky Way!\n\n+ Much more!"

Quickly find rhymes, near rhymes (including slant rhymes), synonyms, antonyms, homophones, similar sounding words, words with the same consonant pattern, and other related words (generalizations, specializations, words appearing in the same context). Use Apple's local dictionaries or ours online if you are unsure of any meanings.\n\nYou get a database of over 150,000 words and phrases right at your fingertips. Find rhymes without an Internet connection, but if you are online, we'll connect you to RhymeZone.com for definitions and all the other great features you've come to love, ad-free! Or you can look it up on our sister site, OneLook.com, or even hear it pronounced with your device's built-in text-to-speech.\n\nThere's also a nifty \"Poet Maker\" feature, which lets you find words that match constraints on both rhyme and meaning at the same time. For example, suppose you want a word that rhymes with \"cat\" and means \"heavy\"; this feature will answer \"fat\" in no time. Or suppose you're looking for a rhyme of \"curious\" that means \"invalid\"; you'll get \"spurious\". You get the idea!\n\nSo whether you're aspiring to be the next Shakespeare, looking to put on the finishing touches of a love poem, bust out the next rap lyric, or just seeking some clever wordplay for your English assignment, give the app a try!"

It is an invaluable resource written when American values and patriotism were based on Christian values.\n\nOf interest to poets and writers, The Noah Webster dictionary was used extensively by Emily Dickinson. We know that she made frequent and extensive use of Noah Webster's American Dictionary of the English Language in writing her poems, paying attention not only to the definitions but also to Webster's etymologies and his illustrative quotations.\n\nBeing able to see how definitions have evolved today is fascinating, and a great resource when studying.\n\nYou can easily search or browse the entire dictionary and add favourites to revisit later.\n\nApp design by professional app developer NASDA Studios."

Search for answers in HSVG, a massive & constantly growing database of equine health info – conveniently available to you “horse side.” \n\nHSVG was created by Doug Thal DVM DABVP, a lifelong horseman & veterinarian that has practiced exclusively equine veterinary medicine for over 20 years & is board certified in equine practice.  \n\nHSVG provides helpful information about equine health from the moment you notice a problem with your horse - My Observation.  It contains practical advice, suggested skills, and questions to discuss with your vet.\n\nHSVG is of value in an emergency and non-emergency, and it helps you distinguish between the two. HSVG also contains dozens of high quality instructional videos, and other media designed to enable you to become an active participant in ensuring your horse’s good health.  \n\nHowever, HSVG is not structured as a simple decision tree that takes you down a singular path based on your input. It is not a substitute for your local equine veterinarian. It does not, and cannot, anticipate and address all of the subtle variations and unique circumstances associated with your horse’s health. That is your veterinarian's job.\n__________________________\n\n- Make better decisions about your horse’s health.\n- Increase the quality of communication between you and your vet.\n- Follow a logical thought process for addressing any equine heath care problem.\n- Utilize a quality alternative to Dr. Google.\n\nOk – so what is Horse Side Vet Guide exactly? \n\nHSVG is a custom-built relational database of equine health information that contains concise information about common problems to rare diseases.  Records are contained in 1 of 9 categories:\n\n- My Observations\n- Vet Diagnostics\n- Vet Diagnoses\n- Vet Treatments\n- My Skills\n- My Supplies\n- Terms & Topics\n- Media\n- Outside Resources\n\nThese records are extensively interlinked, providing a uniquely contextualized approach to any equine health issue. \n\nWe continuously add and update the records in HSVG. We have placed great emphasis on completing the MY OBSERVATIONS records first. You can find \"full access\" records with a keyword search, in the alphabetical browse lists, and hyperlinked inside other records. Incomplete (or \"partial access\") records are listed inside full access records, with no hyperlink. Many other records are hidden from view, and will be available later. After we complete a partial or hidden record we change it to \"full access\" and it becomes immediately available to you after the app has been synchronized to your mobile device. \n\nPlease see our website www.horsesidevetguide.com for more information about this application."

It will bring up the “My Favorites” screen, where you can click on that product and bring it up immediately. It is that easy, and makes shopping for yoshon items a breeze!!\n\n——————\n\nTo contact us, choose text, phone, or WhatsApp chatting. The WhatsApp chat goes to the private texting.\n\nWith over 2,200 product entries (and that number is constantly growing), there are plenty of items to choose from that we have yoshon information on.

Sort by song style to compare birds that hoot and coo, with birds with high pitched songs, or you might like to sort the birds by commonness, so you can listen to the most common ones first, then move on to less frequent backyard visitors. More advanced birders may like to listen to birds from a particular habitat, such as forest or freshwater for example. You can make lists of your favourites so that you can find them quickly.\n\nUse the quiz to test your memory. Answer fast to earn a score multiplier and get on the high score table. Experienced birders can use the custom quiz to help distinguish and learn similar songs. \n\nAnd when you need a rest, try the slideshow feature - choose which birds to include, maybe add background bird song, then simply relax. If you want to continue learning while you relax, switch the voiceover on and hear the name of the bird announced at the end of each clip. This is also a good way of competing with the family - who can say the name of the bird first?\n\nBird names are included in Spanish and French.\n\nProblems? Email us: spiny@spinysoftware.com"

It is perhaps the most widely used and admired book for use in rehearsals today – and is now available on your iPhone or iPad to help you find exactly the right action word within seconds.\n\nActors need actions. You cannot act moods. You need to be doing something with every line. You need an aim to achieve, and an action selected to help achieve that aim. ‘Actions’ are active verbs. In order to play a line truthfully, you need to discover the action that suits that particular situation and that particular line. That is where this app comes in…\n\nIt is a fully searchable, easy-to-navigate thesaurus of active verbs, that will help you refine your acting choice until you find the action you require to make each line come alive.\n\nFeatures include:\n\n·  A to Z search, and predictive search function\n·  Emotional groupings to help you pinpoint the action you require\n·  Bookmark, note-making and random word functions\n·  Share your actions on social media or by email\n·  Full instructions on how to use actioning in rehearsal, plus how to use the app\n\nFor actors at all levels and of all ages, Actions: The Actors’ Thesaurus will revolutionise how you rehearse. Once you’ve started using it, you’ll wonder how you ever managed without it.\n\n‘If you want to act, or act better, Actions will take you a long way on the journey to excellence’ Terry Johnson\n\n'Actioning ain't easy – but it's so useful' Zawe Ashton\n\nBased on the bestselling book Actions: The Actors’ Thesaurus by Marina Caldarone and Maggie Lloyd-Williams"

      "label": "This application is for any gun owner! The purpose of this app is for the legal and conscientious concealed carry license holder to know where they cannot legally carry before getting there. A licensed permit holder or a resident of a constitutional carry state can usually legally carry their firearm in any location other than statutory \"no carry\" locations such as schools, gov. buildings, etc., and in businesses that are posted prohibiting firearms. This is a list of those Posted Anti-Gun businesses. \n\nThis #1-selling app of its kind (both on Apple App Store and other platforms) already includes over 19,000 current anti-gun locations and 17,000 pro-2a alternatives.\n\nFind hotels where you can’t carry before booking a trip to one. Find restaurants where you cannot carry before making dinner plans. Find stores to avoid before you step out the door. It is extremely inconvenient to not find out until you get to a location that they prohibit your second amendment rights. You have to either disarm in the parking lot (causing your vehicle to be a target for thieves) or go somewhere else at the last second. If you know beforehand, you can avoid the places that prohibit carry, or you can leave your firearm at home if you must attend. \n\nWe have a comprehensive list of \"Posted anti-gun\" locations collected in Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin. We have assembled smaller lists in  Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Idaho, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Utah, West Virginia, and Wyoming; provided by many great gun forums and sites with their permission. Since it is crowd-sourced by users like you, please help the list continue to grow!\n\nThe app also includes the option to add pro-gun alternatives that do not prohibit carry.  Search for pro-gun substitutes to the anti-gun businesses.  Easily add new ones to the list every time you experience firearm-friendly (or neutral) service.\n\nThis app includes the easy ability to take action.  Call or email a listed business to let them know your opinion!\n\nLaws regarding signage, and prohibited locations (no sign needed) vary by state. To understand your state’s specific laws, download \"CCW – 50 State Guide\" (http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id443321291). \n\nThis list is user-updated, and will continue to get better over time. But this relies on you! If you go to a place not on the list and they have a sign, please add it with a few clicks via the \"Add a Business\" button! If a place had taken down their sign, get it removed the same way! If you already have a list of anti-gun businesses in your area or state, send us an email. We would love to include any data you have collected, and give you credit for it! \n\nIf you experience any bugs or issues, please email (using the \"Feedback\" button) before leaving app feedback. \n\nDisclaimer: This application implies no warranty regarding the ability to legally carry in any locale or situation and does not constitute legal advice. Every user is responsible for knowing and abiding by the laws in his or her state. Some areas are illegal to carry by statute, even without signage. If unsure, contact local law enforcement or legal counsel. All information provided is simply the opinion of various users who added the location. By downloading and/or purchasing the application, you agree that you assume all risk and are responsible for confirming legality and abiding by all firearm laws. Please see full Disclaimer on Developer Website (below).\n\nThis application was built by Nantz Consulting & Workman Consulting LLC."

      "label": "Ready for exotic birds? iBird Hawaii and Palau is the only 100% complete app guide to birds of the Hawaiian Islands as well as the environmentally sensitive island nation of Palau. The app, which contains 228 species of Hawaiian birds and 169 species of Palauan birds offers all the features that contribute to making iBird the most popular birding app in the world. Like our top of the line iBird Ultimate app, iBird Hawaii and Palau offers the popular Birds Around Me (BAM) GPS feature as well as the Percevia™ Smart Search feature.  \n\nMore Details of What’s New: bit.ly/ibird-whatsnew\n\nIn 2008 iBird broke new ground as it turned the iPhone into a field guide app that identifies birds and plays their songs. Featured in Apple’s television commercials, it started a revolution that made iBird the most respected birding app in the world. \n\n** NOTE If you would like to try out iBird at no expense, check the newly released iBird LITE Free Guide to Birds of North America. It contains all the features of paid iBird Ultimate, but includes just 50 species. And it’s completely FREE. **\n\nWhether you are an experienced birder or a beginner, iBird Hawaii and Palau is the most authoritative guide to these exotic birds. \n\nFeatures\n\n■ Separate databases for Hawaii and Palau allow doing independent searching and identification as well as separate species accounts and song libraries. \n\n■ Birds Around Me (BAM) narrows the species being searched to just those found at your GPS location, within a radius and season you specify. \n\n■ Percevia™ intelligent search is a patented algorithm that guarantees you will only choose search attributes that narrow the matched list of birds. \n\n■ iBird now takes advantage of the high-resolution retina displays of the iPhone and iPad so the screen shows more information than ever.\n\n■ Contains the latest 2017 AOU checklists.\n\n■ Splits History. See what birds were renamed, split into different species or lumped together for 2014, 2015 and 2016.\n\n■ View all birds by head which makes identification easier.\n\n■ Back up and sync favorites and notes with iCloud and share with all your devices and your friends.\n\nPopular Features\n\n■ ‘Birds Around Me’ narrows the search list to just those birds centered on your GPS location, within a specified radius and a specific season. \n\n■ The patented Percevia™ intelligent search prevents you from making the wrong choice when searching for your bird.\n\n■ The only birding app that includes both Illustrations and Photos.\n\n■ Every species is shown perched and in flight and most show major seasonal, age and male/female variations.\n\n■ Identify 397 species of both native and rare Hawaiian and Palauan birds.\n\n■ Save multiple personal species lists and your sightings in Notes which can be backed up and synced in iCloud.\n\n■ Includes hundreds of carefully selected and edited sound recordings from the Xeno-Canto Community of bird song recordists. \n\n■ iBird’s icon-driven visual search engine, with 35 attributes, enables you to identify birds using shape, color, location, habitat, head pattern, flight pattern, bill shape, length and much more.\n\n■ Search by common name, Latin name and even band code.\n\n■ Comprehensive seasonal and migratory range maps include subspecies. \n\n■ The Conservation Status search attribute lets you filter birds by 6 threat levels including Least Concern, Near Threatened, Vulnerable, Endangered, Critically Endangered and Extinct in the Wild. The standard is maintained by Birdlife International and is called the IUCN Red List. \n\nWe invite all users to share their comments and ideas on our forum at www.whatbird.com/forum.

Enter Bar Essay Rules 2021, an Amazon #1 Best Selling book, with verbatim rule statements ready for use - but now in an app!  These rules have been traced to case law, statute and restatement, and provide the most succinct, easily memorized rule statements available.  Updated in October of 2021, this book provides rules applicable in all 50 states, supplemented where appropriate with the law necessary to pass the United States' most difficult Bar exam - California.  \n\nThe rules are broken down by subject, from Civil Procedure to Wills & Trusts, and are provided in flashcard format.  Randomize to review rules from all subjects, or select individual subject to focus your studies.  Already have Rule 16(b) memorized and don't want to see it any longer?  No problem, press the \"Don't Show Again\" button, and remove it from your study deck.  Change your mind and want a full review?  Simply re-add it to your deck and press onward.\n\nThese rules form the basis of all you need to memorize for the bar exam - you will learn the MBEs by doing the questions, and you will learn to put the PT together by doing PTs, but you'll be required to memorize these rules.

Many species are represented with multiple call examples showing the full range of vocalizations.\n● The ability to compare any two images, maps, or sounds, side by side on the screen. The ability to filter by geographic location, so that you see only the species likely to occur in your location, and to further reduce the possibilities to usual or vagrant species in the selected area.\n● A “Smart Search” that gives the ability to search by distinguishing features such as size, colour, physical features, habitat and exclude certain types of birds (eg. Passerines).\n● A basic personal species list that stores your sightings saved to the device* (ability to upload list coming soon)\n● A comprehensive help and introduction section to help you if you get stuck or don’t understand how a certain feature works.\n\n*Uninstalling/reinstalling the program will result in the loss of your list, it is recommended that you keep your own backup (master list) separate from the application.\n\nWe invite all users to share their comments and ideas on our forum at www.mydigitalearth.com \n\nNB.

      "label": "The IAP Bushings & Tubes app provides a searchable and sortable interface to over 4000 pen kits from most of the major kit suppliers. The app displays detailed tube and bushing specifications and drill bit requirements for every kit in the app database. These kit details can be emailed or printed via Air Print. You can create a favorites list of your most frequently used kits for faster access to those kits rather than searching through the entire app database every time you need to reference those kits. You can also reorder the database by your preferred supplier order.\n\nThe app also includes a drill bit converter for converting between inch fractional, inch decimal, metric and gauge drill sizes. Conversions to inch fractional are made to the nearest 1/64\" and conversions to gauge drill size are made to the nearest gauge drill size (107-1 and A-Z). An error factor is displayed for inexact conversions to inch fractional and gauge drill size.\n\nA 30-digit, 4-function calculator is included in the app. It has several advanced features not found in many simple calculators including a memory cell and the ability to display data in decimal or scientific notation.\n\nPhotos, Instructions and Bushing Drawings are available for most of the kits. When instructions or bushings are available, they may be viewed, mailed or printed.\n\nThe app also contains several lists of useful references: Worldwide Suppliers of pen kits with links to take you directly to their web site; Helpful Penturning videos with links that will take you directly to the video; and Penturning Tutorials with links that will download the tutorial to your device for viewing in the app or to email or print.\n\nThe app will automatically download database updates and the kit reference files from the IAP server."

The Moravian Daily Texts has been living this ecumenical dream for many years!\n\nFirst published in 1731 in Saxony, the Daily Texts grew out of a spiritual renewal of the Moravian Church (Unitas Fratrum) that dates back to August 13, 1727. Today, more than 280 years after its first publication, the Daily Texts continues its promise of “a daily message from God that is new every morning.” \n\nThe Moravian Daily Texts offers an inspirational connection to the Holy Scriptures every day. Each entry in this beloved daily devotional includes “watchwords”—Old and New Testament verses to accompany readers throughout the day—combined with heartfelt prayers written by Moravian Church pastors and members from across North America.\n\nEach day, the Daily Texts app offers these verses and prayers, along with links to the full Bible verses in context (note: web access is required for this feature). In addition, the Daily Texts app includes a plan that guides readers through the Psalms in one year and the Old and New Testaments in two years.\n\nFeatures in this app include:\n- Text-to-speech capability, allowing users to hear the Daily Texts read\n- Journaling capability to capture thoughts and insights on each day's Daily Texts\n- Search functions by word or Bible verse\n- Texts for 2017-2021\n- Indicators for favorite Daily Texts and Texts read\n- Notifications\n\nProduced by the Interprovincial Board of Communication of the Moravian Church in America, the texts in this app are contained in the North American printed versions of the Moravian Daily Texts 2021 (note: hymn texts available in the printed versions are not included in this app). The Daily Texts are shared in more than 50 languages around the world.\n\nFor more information about the Moravian Daily Texts, please visit www.moravian.org."

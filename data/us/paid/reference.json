      "label": "This application is for any gun owner! The purpose of this app is for the legal and conscientious concealed carry license holder to know where they cannot legally carry before getting there. A licensed permit holder or a resident of a constitutional carry state can usually legally carry their firearm in any location other than statutory \"no carry\" locations such as schools, gov. buildings, etc., and in businesses that are posted prohibiting firearms. This is a list of those Posted Anti-Gun businesses. \n\nThis #1-selling app of its kind (both on Apple App Store and other platforms) already includes over 19,000 current anti-gun locations and 17,000 pro-2a alternatives.\n\nFind hotels where you can’t carry before booking a trip to one. Find restaurants where you cannot carry before making dinner plans. Find stores to avoid before you step out the door. It is extremely inconvenient to not find out until you get to a location that they prohibit your second amendment rights. You have to either disarm in the parking lot (causing your vehicle to be a target for thieves) or go somewhere else at the last second. If you know beforehand, you can avoid the places that prohibit carry, or you can leave your firearm at home if you must attend. \n\nWe have a comprehensive list of \"Posted anti-gun\" locations collected in Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin. We have assembled smaller lists in  Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Idaho, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Utah, West Virginia, and Wyoming; provided by many great gun forums and sites with their permission. Since it is crowd-sourced by users like you, please help the list continue to grow!\n\nThe app also includes the option to add pro-gun alternatives that do not prohibit carry.  Search for pro-gun substitutes to the anti-gun businesses.  Easily add new ones to the list every time you experience firearm-friendly (or neutral) service.\n\nThis app includes the easy ability to take action.  Call or email a listed business to let them know your opinion!\n\nLaws regarding signage, and prohibited locations (no sign needed) vary by state. To understand your state’s specific laws, download \"CCW – 50 State Guide\" (http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id443321291). \n\nThis list is user-updated, and will continue to get better over time. But this relies on you! If you go to a place not on the list and they have a sign, please add it with a few clicks via the \"Add a Business\" button! If a place had taken down their sign, get it removed the same way! If you already have a list of anti-gun businesses in your area or state, send us an email. We would love to include any data you have collected, and give you credit for it! \n\nIf you experience any bugs or issues, please email (using the \"Feedback\" button) before leaving app feedback. \n\nDisclaimer: This application implies no warranty regarding the ability to legally carry in any locale or situation and does not constitute legal advice. Every user is responsible for knowing and abiding by the laws in his or her state. Some areas are illegal to carry by statute, even without signage. If unsure, contact local law enforcement or legal counsel. All information provided is simply the opinion of various users who added the location. By downloading and/or purchasing the application, you agree that you assume all risk and are responsible for confirming legality and abiding by all firearm laws. Please see full Disclaimer on Developer Website (below).\n\nThis application was built by Nantz Consulting & Workman Consulting LLC."

Quickly find rhymes, near rhymes (including slant rhymes), synonyms, antonyms, homophones, similar sounding words, words with the same consonant pattern, and other related words (generalizations, specializations, words appearing in the same context). Use Apple's local dictionaries or ours online if you are unsure of any meanings.\n\nYou get a database of over 150,000 words and phrases right at your fingertips. Find rhymes without an Internet connection, but if you are online, we'll connect you to RhymeZone.com for definitions and all the other great features you've come to love, ad-free! Or you can look it up on our sister site, OneLook.com, or even hear it pronounced with your device's built-in text-to-speech.\n\nThere's also a nifty \"Poet Maker\" feature, which lets you find words that match constraints on both rhyme and meaning at the same time. For example, suppose you want a word that rhymes with \"cat\" and means \"heavy\"; this feature will answer \"fat\" in no time. Or suppose you're looking for a rhyme of \"curious\" that means \"invalid\"; you'll get \"spurious\". You get the idea!\n\nSo whether you're aspiring to be the next Shakespeare, looking to put on the finishing touches of a love poem, bust out the next rap lyric, or just seeking some clever wordplay for your English assignment, give the app a try!"

Its intrinsic value will not only be of great interest to those studying American heritage and Christian studies, but also to writers and those exploring poetry.\n\nNoah Websters 1828 American Dictionary contains the greatest number of Biblical definitions given in any reference volume. It is an invaluable resource written when American values and patriotism were based on Christian values.\n\nOf interest to poets and writers, The Noah Webster dictionary was used extensively by Emily Dickinson. We know that she made frequent and extensive use of Noah Webster's American Dictionary of the English Language in writing her poems, paying attention not only to the definitions but also to Webster's etymologies and his illustrative quotations.\n\nBeing able to see how definitions have evolved today is fascinating, and a great resource when studying.\n\nYou can easily search or browse the entire dictionary and add favourites to revisit later.\n\nApp design by professional app developer NASDA Studios."

      "label": "The Countdown Maps Mobile App is a fun and convenient way to keep track of your missionaries. Whether they are your children, parents, family, or friends, you can track as many Elders, Sisters, or Couples as you wish and incorporate as many details as you like. This is perfect for parents, families, bishops, and anyone who has friends or family serving missions. Here are some of the features:\n\nMissionaries Page – Shows all of the missionaries you are tracking and where they are serving. Photos can be inserted as a visual reminder. This list can be sorted alphabetically or by the date that they return home. \n\nMissionary Stats – If you tap on a missionary from the list, you can see all of the information about that missionary including their picture, the flag of the state or country where they are serving, days served, days remaining, percent complete, email address, mailing address, current companion(s), and a favorite scripture or quote. The email address is also a direct link to your email, so that you can start an email to them from this view. You can also put in a future departure date and it will countdown the days until they leave.\n\nMissionary Edit Page – Edit the missionary’s information to make updates to picture, area, departure and return dates, email address, and quotes. \n\nTransfers – If you click on the View Transfers button, you see a list of all the transfers that have been entered. From here you can add new transfers or companions or edit existing ones. On the Edit Transfer page, you can enter their current area, companion, date of the transfer, choose a color for the map, enter their mailing address, and add notes about that things that are going on in that area. Information from the most recent transfer is moved onto the Stats page. \n\nView Map – If you click on the View Map button, you will see an outline map of the country or state where that missionary is serving. This map is automatically filled in as the days go by to show their progress in the map. Colors coordinate with the Transfers list – you can changes colors based on areas, companion, by transfer, or whatever you would like. Have fun, be creative. \n\nShare – This button allows you to send the missionary’s email address, mailing address, and other information in a variety of formats (text, PDF, Link) using several sharing methods (message, email, Facebook, etc.). User can choose which information to send and in what format. This is a quick and easy way to send contact information to family or friends who want to write to them and keeps people updated in social media. Copy & Paste functionality is also enabled through the Share button.

From here, you can sync your data across multiple devices and protect against data loss when upgrading devices or in the event of a device failure. To use this feature, just create a Sync Account.\n\nThis is the perfect app for keeping up on your missionaries on a daily basis and it brings all of the relevant information together in a fun and creative way."

Enter Bar Essay Rules 2021, an Amazon #1 Best Selling book, with verbatim rule statements ready for use - but now in an app!  These rules have been traced to case law, statute and restatement, and provide the most succinct, easily memorized rule statements available.  Updated in October of 2021, this book provides rules applicable in all 50 states, supplemented where appropriate with the law necessary to pass the United States' most difficult Bar exam - California.  \n\nThe rules are broken down by subject, from Civil Procedure to Wills & Trusts, and are provided in flashcard format.  Randomize to review rules from all subjects, or select individual subject to focus your studies.  Already have Rule 16(b) memorized and don't want to see it any longer?  No problem, press the \"Don't Show Again\" button, and remove it from your study deck.  Change your mind and want a full review?  Simply re-add it to your deck and press onward.\n\nThese rules form the basis of all you need to memorize for the bar exam - you will learn the MBEs by doing the questions, and you will learn to put the PT together by doing PTs, but you'll be required to memorize these rules.  Make it easy, download the app and bring the rules with you wherever you go.\n\nA 5-Solid Star Legal Reference, please see www.nobullbarprep.com for more information."

The children of the promise would have forgotten their heritage and identity and all the history that they ought to have known.\n\nThey would now require some extensive hand-holding as they are taken from passage to passage, and the understanding of each line of scripture is ellucidated and taught to them precept by precept.\n\nIf you want to understand the bible, you will need to be guided by the precepts, which are the keys to unlocking the meanings and intents of its passages in context. Let scripture interpret scripture.\n\nSTART LEARNING PRECEPTS NOW!\n- Start by reading the verses and passages related to each precept;\n- Get the understanding of the precept by reading the cross-linked verses;\n- You begin to see the consistency in scripture when you realise that certain words and phrases maintain specific meaning in all the verses they appear in;\n- Connect the dots and you begin to see the bigger picture of what the bible is really revealing.\n\nMORE FEATURES WITH EACH UPDATE\n- Easy navigation for chapters and verses;\n- Quickly check up on precepts listed under a verse, and link to cross-linked verses;\n- Adjust font sizes for accessibility;\n- Use the contact form to send us messages and what you've discovered;\n- Join our mailing list and get updates about our occasional updates and learning aids;\n\nREDISCOVER THE CORRECT WAY TO UNDERSTAND SCRIPTURE\n- Build up entire teaching series using bible precepts to maintain true scriptural meanings and consistency in the understanding delivered.\n\nJoin us on social media and share the gospel to wake up the lost sheep!\nShare this app with friends and family and be part of their awakening."

With NeuBible's spine navigation, it's always easy to remember where you are and what you were doing. Plus, it's always within a thumb's reach, and even easy to use with the larger screens of the iPhone 6 & 6 Plus!\n\n• A beautiful, considered reading experience — We've licensed fonts from Hoefler & Co, Linotype, Commercial Type & DSType, and hand-tuned the margins, line spacing and font sizes to give you as considered a reading experience as you'll find anywhere on iOS.\n\n• Lightweight...AND LIGHTNING FAST — From its insanely quick loading speed, to its inventive use of navigation, everything about NeuBible has been optimized and engineered to get you to books and verses, and get reading as quickly as possible.\n\n• Quick Search — Double tap anywhere while reading to quickly access search and easily find books, keywords, and even jump directly to verses.\n\n• Timeline View — Quickly access your highlighted verses, along with any verse(s) you've bookmarked.\n\n• Easy chapter navigation — Swipe left in the book view or while reading to quickly navigate to other chapters.\n\n• Reading mode customization — Customize your reading experience with control of font formatting and day & night reading modes.\n\n• Reading Reminders — No unwanted push notifications here, just the ones you set yourself.\n\n• Gesture-based verse highlighting — Simply tap, hold, and drag your finger down the screen to highlight and copy verses.\n\n• Make NeuBible your own w/ themes — Since the Bible is one of the most personal reading experiences you'll ever have, we wanted to help you make it feel even more personal. Themes are basically like going to the bookstore and picking out that ONE perfect Bible for yourself when you were a kid...\n\n• iCloud Sync — Keep all of your highlights* and timeline backed up and synced across devices seamlessly with iCloud Sync\n\n*We currently only support iCloud sync for highlights at this time. We've put a lot of thought into this and feel that even though it would be easy to do, given the different places and ways most people use their iPhones and iPads, also syncing reading position and bookmark wouldn't provide the best user experience.\n\n-----------\n\nAVAILABLE TRANSLATIONS\n\n• English Standard Version (ESV)*\n• Holman Christian Standard Bible (HCSB)\n• World English Bible (WEB)\n• American Standard Version (ASV)\n• King James Version (KJV)\n• Common English Bible (CEB)*\n• New American Standard Bible (NASB)*\n• New International Version (NIV)*\n• New King James Version (NKJV)*\n\n*Available via in-app purchase\n\n-----------\n\n\nIf you'd like to find out more about the translation licensing process, ask us a question about the ones that are currently available, or send us a request for your favorite translation, you contact us at http://www.neubible.co, on Facebook, or on Twitter at @neubibleco"

      "label": "Strong's Concordance, is a concordance of the King James Bible (KJV) that was constructed under the direction of Dr. James Strong (1822–1894) and first published in 1890.\n\nA concordance lets the reader directly compare how the same word may be used else where in the Bible. In this way the Strong's Concordance provides an independent check against translations, and offers an opportunity for greater, and more technically accurate understanding of the Bible text.\n\nWant to see it in action before you buy? Try Strong's Concordance Lite which provides a 100% functional demo of Matthew and Genesis.\n\nThis program does not require internet access, everything you need is all stored on the iDevice.\n\nFeatures:\n* Search for English words, and lookup Greek/Hebrew dictionaries.\n* Proper concordance, listing how the word was translated in other bible verses.\n* Full King James Text is included\n* Click on any blue word for concordance text.\n* Night mode for those that like to read at night (White on black)\n* iPad support\n\nPlease note: This version is not an \"exhaustive\" concordance, and does skip smaller words such as \"and, or, the, a\" as well as some other words. Though we think you'll find it has most (if not all) the words you'll ever need.\n\nWe're open to suggestions for improvement in future versions. Send comments and suggestions to strongs at orionsys.org."

Sort by song style to compare birds that hoot and coo, with birds with high pitched songs, or you might like to sort the birds by commonness, so you can listen to the most common ones first, then move on to less frequent backyard visitors. More advanced birders may like to listen to birds from a particular habitat, such as forest or freshwater for example. You can make lists of your favourites so that you can find them quickly.\n\nUse the quiz to test your memory. Answer fast to earn a score multiplier and get on the high score table. Experienced birders can use the custom quiz to help distinguish and learn similar songs. \n\nAnd when you need a rest, try the slideshow feature - choose which birds to include, maybe add background bird song, then simply relax. If you want to continue learning while you relax, switch the voiceover on and hear the name of the bird announced at the end of each clip. This is also a good way of competing with the family - who can say the name of the bird first?\n\nBird names are included in Spanish and French.\n\nProblems? Email us: spiny@spinysoftware.com"

No truth is more evident to my mind than that the Christian religion must be the basis of any government intended to secure the rights and privileges of a free people.\"\n\nNoah Webster, the Father of American Christian education, wrote the first American dictionary and established a system of rules to govern spelling, grammar, and reading. This master linguist understood the power of words, their definitions, and the need for precise word usage in communication to maintain independence. Webster used the Bible as the foundation for his definitions thus making the 1828 Dictionary a work that contains more Biblical definitions than any other reference work.\n\nThis app is an essential tool for students of all ages."

      "label": "Explore a 3D globe of Mars\n\nMars Atlas is an astronomy application that lets you use pinch and finger gestures to manipulate a 3D globe of Mars. As you zoom in more labels appear as finer detail comes into view. You can double tap on the labels to get more information about a particular feature.\n\nMars Atlas displays the approximate phase, axial tilt and central meridian of Mars from your chosen location and time, and renders these on the globe. You can switch to a 'Globe' mode that allows you to spin Mars around to see the whole globe. The feature database is searchable and can move the globe to a searched feature. The phase can be switched off to show the whole globe more clearly.\n\nDate, time and location can be changed. There is also a realtime mode that will update to the current time.\n\nThe Mars globe can be shown with north or south at the top or inverted to suit different telescope views.\n\nOver 1600 named features are included as well as 6 spacecraft that returned data from the surface of Mars.\n\nYou can swipe left and right on the phase view to go backwards and forwards a day.\n\nMoon, Mercury, Venus, Jupiter and Saturn atlases are also available on the App Store!\n\nAlso there is Planisphere, a star charting app, available on the App Store!"

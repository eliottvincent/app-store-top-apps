It is an invaluable resource written when American values and patriotism were based on Christian values.\n\nOf interest to poets and writers, The Noah Webster dictionary was used extensively by Emily Dickinson. We know that she made frequent and extensive use of Noah Webster's American Dictionary of the English Language in writing her poems, paying attention not only to the definitions but also to Webster's etymologies and his illustrative quotations.\n\nBeing able to see how definitions have evolved today is fascinating, and a great resource when studying.\n\nYou can easily search or browse the entire dictionary and add favourites to revisit later.\n\nApp design by professional app developer NASDA Studios."

Quickly find rhymes, near rhymes (including slant rhymes), synonyms, antonyms, homophones, similar sounding words, words with the same consonant pattern, and other related words (generalizations, specializations, words appearing in the same context). Use Apple's local dictionaries or ours online if you are unsure of any meanings.\n\nYou get a database of over 150,000 words and phrases right at your fingertips. Find rhymes without an Internet connection, but if you are online, we'll connect you to RhymeZone.com for definitions and all the other great features you've come to love, ad-free! Or you can look it up on our sister site, OneLook.com, or even hear it pronounced with your device's built-in text-to-speech.\n\nThere's also a nifty \"Poet Maker\" feature, which lets you find words that match constraints on both rhyme and meaning at the same time. For example, suppose you want a word that rhymes with \"cat\" and means \"heavy\"; this feature will answer \"fat\" in no time. Or suppose you're looking for a rhyme of \"curious\" that means \"invalid\"; you'll get \"spurious\". You get the idea!\n\nSo whether you're aspiring to be the next Shakespeare, looking to put on the finishing touches of a love poem, bust out the next rap lyric, or just seeking some clever wordplay for your English assignment, give the app a try!"

      "label": "Strong's Concordance, is a concordance of the King James Bible (KJV) that was constructed under the direction of Dr. James Strong (1822–1894) and first published in 1890.\n\nA concordance lets the reader directly compare how the same word may be used else where in the Bible. In this way the Strong's Concordance provides an independent check against translations, and offers an opportunity for greater, and more technically accurate understanding of the Bible text.\n\nWant to see it in action before you buy? Try Strong's Concordance Lite which provides a 100% functional demo of Matthew and Genesis.\n\nThis program does not require internet access, everything you need is all stored on the iDevice.\n\nFeatures:\n* Search for English words, and lookup Greek/Hebrew dictionaries.\n* Proper concordance, listing how the word was translated in other bible verses.\n* Full King James Text is included\n* Click on any blue word for concordance text.\n* Night mode for those that like to read at night (White on black)\n* iPad support\n\nPlease note: This version is not an \"exhaustive\" concordance, and does skip smaller words such as \"and, or, the, a\" as well as some other words. Though we think you'll find it has most (if not all) the words you'll ever need.\n\nWe're open to suggestions for improvement in future versions. Send comments and suggestions to strongs at orionsys.org."

Search for answers in HSVG, a massive & constantly growing database of equine health info – conveniently available to you “horse side.” \n\nHSVG was created by Doug Thal DVM DABVP, a lifelong horseman & veterinarian that has practiced exclusively equine veterinary medicine for over 20 years & is board certified in equine practice.  \n\nHSVG provides helpful information about equine health from the moment you notice a problem with your horse - My Observation.  It contains practical advice, suggested skills, and questions to discuss with your vet.\n\nHSVG is of value in an emergency and non-emergency, and it helps you distinguish between the two. HSVG also contains dozens of high quality instructional videos, and other media designed to enable you to become an active participant in ensuring your horse’s good health.  \n\nHowever, HSVG is not structured as a simple decision tree that takes you down a singular path based on your input. It is not a substitute for your local equine veterinarian. It does not, and cannot, anticipate and address all of the subtle variations and unique circumstances associated with your horse’s health. That is your veterinarian's job.\n__________________________\n\n- Make better decisions about your horse’s health.\n- Increase the quality of communication between you and your vet.\n- Follow a logical thought process for addressing any equine heath care problem.\n- Utilize a quality alternative to Dr. Google.\n\nOk – so what is Horse Side Vet Guide exactly? \n\nHSVG is a custom-built relational database of equine health information that contains concise information about common problems to rare diseases.  Records are contained in 1 of 9 categories:\n\n- My Observations\n- Vet Diagnostics\n- Vet Diagnoses\n- Vet Treatments\n- My Skills\n- My Supplies\n- Terms & Topics\n- Media\n- Outside Resources\n\nThese records are extensively interlinked, providing a uniquely contextualized approach to any equine health issue. \n\nWe continuously add and update the records in HSVG. We have placed great emphasis on completing the MY OBSERVATIONS records first. You can find \"full access\" records with a keyword search, in the alphabetical browse lists, and hyperlinked inside other records. Incomplete (or \"partial access\") records are listed inside full access records, with no hyperlink. Many other records are hidden from view, and will be available later. After we complete a partial or hidden record we change it to \"full access\" and it becomes immediately available to you after the app has been synchronized to your mobile device. \n\nPlease see our website www.horsesidevetguide.com for more information about this application."

God is a God of order as evidenced in His works of creation and redemption. Consequently, order belongs to the essence of His church. Order is achieved through principles and regulations that guide the Church in its internal operations and in fulfillmenting its mission to the world. In order for it to be a successful ecclesiastical organization at the service of the Lord and humanity, it needs order, rule, and discipline. Scripture affirms that “all things be done decently and in order” (1 Cor. 14:40)."

      "label": "This application is for any gun owner! The purpose of this app is for the legal and conscientious concealed carry license holder to know where they cannot legally carry before getting there. A licensed permit holder or a resident of a constitutional carry state can usually legally carry their firearm in any location other than statutory \"no carry\" locations such as schools, gov. buildings, etc., and in businesses that are posted prohibiting firearms. This is a list of those Posted Anti-Gun businesses. \n\nThis #1-selling app of its kind (both on Apple App Store and other platforms) already includes over 19,000 current anti-gun locations and 17,000 pro-2a alternatives.\n\nFind hotels where you can’t carry before booking a trip to one. Find restaurants where you cannot carry before making dinner plans. Find stores to avoid before you step out the door. It is extremely inconvenient to not find out until you get to a location that they prohibit your second amendment rights. You have to either disarm in the parking lot (causing your vehicle to be a target for thieves) or go somewhere else at the last second. If you know beforehand, you can avoid the places that prohibit carry, or you can leave your firearm at home if you must attend. \n\nWe have a comprehensive list of \"Posted anti-gun\" locations collected in Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin. We have assembled smaller lists in  Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Idaho, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Utah, West Virginia, and Wyoming; provided by many great gun forums and sites with their permission. Since it is crowd-sourced by users like you, please help the list continue to grow!\n\nThe app also includes the option to add pro-gun alternatives that do not prohibit carry.  Search for pro-gun substitutes to the anti-gun businesses.  Easily add new ones to the list every time you experience firearm-friendly (or neutral) service.\n\nThis app includes the easy ability to take action.  Call or email a listed business to let them know your opinion!\n\nLaws regarding signage, and prohibited locations (no sign needed) vary by state. To understand your state’s specific laws, download \"CCW – 50 State Guide\" (http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id443321291). \n\nThis list is user-updated, and will continue to get better over time. But this relies on you! If you go to a place not on the list and they have a sign, please add it with a few clicks via the \"Add a Business\" button! If a place had taken down their sign, get it removed the same way! If you already have a list of anti-gun businesses in your area or state, send us an email. We would love to include any data you have collected, and give you credit for it! \n\nIf you experience any bugs or issues, please email (using the \"Feedback\" button) before leaving app feedback. \n\nDisclaimer: This application implies no warranty regarding the ability to legally carry in any locale or situation and does not constitute legal advice. Every user is responsible for knowing and abiding by the laws in his or her state. Some areas are illegal to carry by statute, even without signage. If unsure, contact local law enforcement or legal counsel. All information provided is simply the opinion of various users who added the location. By downloading and/or purchasing the application, you agree that you assume all risk and are responsible for confirming legality and abiding by all firearm laws. Please see full Disclaimer on Developer Website (below).\n\nThis application was built by Nantz Consulting & Workman Consulting LLC."

Every Public Safety Official needs to know where the missing person might be, what to ask, where to look, and what to do when minutes matter. The app was built around the field needs of Public Safety Officials.  No matter how remote the location, the app continues to function since no network connection is required, once installed.\n\nThis life-saving information is customized for 41 different subject categories. The categories are organized into a hierarchy of groups including external factors (abductions, aircraft), water incidents (boats and persons in the water), wheeled incidents (ATV, mountain bikes, vehicles, etc.), mental states (autism, dementia, despondent, intellectual disability, mental illness, substance intoxication), children (in five different age groups), and eighteen outdoor activities (hiker, hunter, climber, gatherer, skier, etc.).\n\nThe app guides the user in selecting the correct subject category by several means. The subject category wizard allows the user to select potential scenarios and then will suggest the best match for the subject category.  For example, if a child was riding his bicycle and was then known to be abducted, the user could select Child, Wheel/Motorized, and Abduction; the wizard would suggest using the abduction category. Alternately, the user can go straight to a subject category by using favorites, an alphabetical list, or the hierarchy list. Once the subject category is selected, the Lost Person Behavior App provides the user with: \n•\tbehavioral profiles\n•\ttactical briefings\n•\tspecific investigative questions\n•\tspatial and survival statistics\n•\tsuggestions for initial tasks (reflex tasking).\n\nThe all-new tactical briefings distill the statistics and profiles to the key points that every field searcher must know. The more extensive profile, full statistics, and suggested initial tasks assist even the seasoned search planner. The highly detailed questions for the investigation resulted from decades of SAR experience and thousands of missions.\n\nThe app even allows you to email a checklist of these critical tasks and interview questions so that you may print them out.  The email could also be used for providing remote support or documenting tasks that have been completed.\n\nDetermining where to look is one of the major functions of the search statistics, which are now provided in a graphical and tabular format.  The statistics from thousands of SAR missions allow the search planner to see where similar previous search subjects were found. The SAR statistics include:\n•\tDistance from the Initial Planning Point\n•\tElevation model (likelihood of going up, down, or staying at the same elevation)\n•\tMobility model (how long will the subject keep moving)\n•\tDispersion angle (given a direction of travel, how well does that predict subject’s location)\n•\tTrack Offset model (how far away from a feature such as a road or trail is subject found)\n•\tFind location (at what type of geographic feature was the subject found)\n•\tScenario (what caused the subject to become missing)\n•\tSurvivability overall (what is the overall chance of finding the subject alive or injured)\n•\tSurvivability rate (how does survivability rate change in 24-hour increments).\n\nThe Lost Person Behavior App can be easily customized to only show the statistical information you actually need. The user can customize for ecoregion, terrain, and urban incidents. The user can view the data in both metric and English units. Several additional helpful tools are built into the app. Contextual help is provided on every page with additional information boxes, which explain every element of the app on the page you need.  The information page provides information about the bike wheel model used to describe initial tactical deployment (reflex tasking), a glossary, help, and contact information."

It allows sorting by distance or by Trustee callsign as well as filtering by band and radius in miles or kilometers.\n\nNOW RFinder Routing is integrated with RT Systems radio programmers! Your subscription bought here by installing this app gives you access in RT...just make sure RT is updated to the latest version by pressing Help-Update. Click File-External Data->RFinder Web Search and click Route! Easy as pie to program your radio now for a trip you are taking with just a few easy clicks...check out the tutorial video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaeRzcnNNdQ\n\nNOW INCLUDES SOCIAL FUNCTIONS!!!! In the repeater detail screen, click the Check In button. All users will see that you are on that machine! This can be used to find your friends or a machine with a user on it. In the settings bundle app/RFinder you can turn on APRS posting. This posts your current position with the repeater you are checked into. You can also let your friends on Facebook® know what repeater you are on as well as your Twitter® followers, when checking in.\n\nNOW INTEGRATED WITH THE EchoLink APP!!\nFrom the repeater detail screen, any repeater that has an Echolink node attached just touch the number and if you have the EchoLink app installed it will launch to that node automatically for you.\n\nOur repeater locator database is growing daily.\nAccess to the Directory is included for one year then it will be an annual subscription for $9.99, and your subscription works for all platforms.... Each purchase of a new platform advances your annual to a year from that new purchase date.

Don't forget LAT/LON (in decimal), use periods as decimals, please.\n\nThe application accesses our Worldwide Repeater Directory and scanner directory for Amateur Radio (Ham Radio) but only stores information for repeaters within approximately 80 miles (125 km) from your location on your handheld at any one time, saving you room on your device and allowing distance calculation and mapping features to operate smoothly. It uses geolocation either via cell tower triangulation, GPS or manual location entry (so you can look up the repeaters you will use on vacation or business trips, etc.).\n\nIf anyone has lists of Amateur Radio repeaters from their countries we would love to incorporate that into our database.\n\nWorldwide IRLP and Echolink nodes.\n\n© ITWeRKS 2011"

The Moravian Daily Texts has been living this ecumenical dream for many years!\n\nFirst published in 1731 in Saxony, the Daily Texts grew out of a spiritual renewal of the Moravian Church (Unitas Fratrum) that dates back to August 13, 1727. Today, more than 280 years after its first publication, the Daily Texts continues its promise of “a daily message from God that is new every morning.” \n\nThe Moravian Daily Texts offers an inspirational connection to the Holy Scriptures every day. Each entry in this beloved daily devotional includes “watchwords”—Old and New Testament verses to accompany readers throughout the day—combined with heartfelt prayers written by Moravian Church pastors and members from across North America.\n\nEach day, the Daily Texts app offers these verses and prayers, along with links to the full Bible verses in context (note: web access is required for this feature). In addition, the Daily Texts app includes a plan that guides readers through the Psalms in one year and the Old and New Testaments in two years.\n\nFeatures in this app include:\n- Text-to-speech capability, allowing users to hear the Daily Texts read\n- Journaling capability to capture thoughts and insights on each day's Daily Texts\n- Search functions by word or Bible verse\n- Texts for 2017-2023\n- Indicators for favorite Daily Texts and Texts read\n- Notifications\n\nProduced by the Interprovincial Board of Communication of the Moravian Church in America, the texts in this app are contained in the North American printed versions of the Moravian Daily Texts 2023 (note: hymn texts available in the printed versions are not included in this app). The Daily Texts are shared in more than 50 languages around the world.\n\nFor more information about the Moravian Daily Texts, please visit www.moravian.org."

The children of the promise would have forgotten their heritage and identity and all the history that they ought to have known.\n\nThey would now require some extensive hand-holding as they are taken from passage to passage, and the understanding of each line of scripture is ellucidated and taught to them precept by precept.\n\nIf you want to understand the bible, you will need to be guided by the precepts, which are the keys to unlocking the meanings and intents of its passages in context. Let scripture interpret scripture.\n\nSTART LEARNING PRECEPTS NOW!\n- Start by reading the verses and passages related to each precept;\n- Get the understanding of the precept by reading the cross-linked verses;\n- You begin to see the consistency in scripture when you realise that certain words and phrases maintain specific meaning in all the verses they appear in;\n- Connect the dots and you begin to see the bigger picture of what the bible is really revealing.\n\nMORE FEATURES WITH EACH UPDATE\n- Easy navigation for chapters and verses;\n- Quickly check up on precepts listed under a verse, and link to cross-linked verses;\n- Adjust font sizes for accessibility;\n- Use the contact form to send us messages and what you've discovered;\n- Join our mailing list and get updates about our occasional updates and learning aids;\n\nREDISCOVER THE CORRECT WAY TO UNDERSTAND SCRIPTURE\n- Build up entire teaching series using bible precepts to maintain true scriptural meanings and consistency in the understanding delivered.\n\nJoin us on social media and share the gospel to wake up the lost sheep!\nShare this app with friends and family and be part of their awakening."

This map is automatically filled in as the days go by to show their progress in the map. Colors coordinate with the Transfers list – you can changes colors based on areas, companion, by transfer, or whatever you would like. Have fun, be creative. \n\nShare – This button allows you to send the missionary’s email address, mailing address, and other information in a variety of formats (text, PDF, Link) using several sharing methods (message, email, Facebook, etc.).

Click LOOKUP and if an error code is found it will be displayed. No more digging through a service manual to find obscure error codes. \n\nThe keyboard layout will change slightly depending on if you have selected a Gilbarco, Tokheim, or Dresser-Wayne dispenser.\n\nNEW in version 4\nNow has the ability to download a small update file when ever new error codes are released.\nabout every 30 days the app will ask you if you want to check for updates.\n\nDISCLAIMER - This app IS NOT a substitute for a qualified service technician!"

All you need to do is to provide a good scan or a good photograph of the stamp and the Stamp Analyser does the rest.\n\nOptionally, you can add the stamp Soundness and Eye Appeal components to obtain the final grade. The Soundness and Eye Appeal components are based on the PSE Grading Guide.\n\nThe Stamp Analyser user interface has been designed to be intuitive and simple. On the Mac, you simply drag and drop your stamp image into the Stamp Analyser.

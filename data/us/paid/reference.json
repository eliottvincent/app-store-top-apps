      "label": "Find the right word wherever you go. The official RhymeZone iOS app is a fast, powerful rhyming dictionary and thesaurus that you can use anywhere, even if you're not on the net. Quickly find rhymes, near rhymes (including slant rhymes), synonyms, antonyms, homophones, similar sounding words, words with the same consonant pattern, and other related words (generalizations, specializations, words appearing in the same context). Use Apple's local dictionaries or ours online if you are unsure of any meanings.\n\nYou get a database of over 150,000 words and phrases right at your fingertips. Find rhymes without an Internet connection, but if you are online, we'll connect you to RhymeZone.com for definitions and all the other great features you've come to love, ad-free! Or you can look it up on our sister site, OneLook.com, or even hear it pronounced with your device's built-in text-to-speech.\n\nThere's also a nifty \"Poet Maker\" feature, which lets you find words that match constraints on both rhyme and meaning at the same time. For example, suppose you want a word that rhymes with \"cat\" and means \"heavy\"; this feature will answer \"fat\" in no time. Or suppose you're looking for a rhyme of \"curious\" that means \"invalid\"; you'll get \"spurious\". You get the idea!\n\nSo whether you're aspiring to be the next Shakespeare, looking to put on the finishing touches of a love poem, bust out the next rap lyric, or just seeking some clever wordplay for your English assignment, give the app a try!"

It is an invaluable resource written when American values and patriotism were based on Christian values.\n\nOf interest to poets and writers, The Noah Webster dictionary was used extensively by Emily Dickinson. We know that she made frequent and extensive use of Noah Webster's American Dictionary of the English Language in writing her poems, paying attention not only to the definitions but also to Webster's etymologies and his illustrative quotations.\n\nBeing able to see how definitions have evolved today is fascinating, and a great resource when studying.\n\nYou can easily search or browse the entire dictionary and add favourites to revisit later.\n\nApp design by professional app developer NASDA Studios."

      "label": "Strong's Concordance, is a concordance of the King James Bible (KJV) that was constructed under the direction of Dr. James Strong (1822–1894) and first published in 1890.\n\nA concordance lets the reader directly compare how the same word may be used else where in the Bible. In this way the Strong's Concordance provides an independent check against translations, and offers an opportunity for greater, and more technically accurate understanding of the Bible text.\n\nWant to see it in action before you buy? Try Strong's Concordance Lite which provides a 100% functional demo of Matthew and Genesis.\n\nThis program does not require internet access, everything you need is all stored on the iDevice.\n\nFeatures:\n* Search for English words, and lookup Greek/Hebrew dictionaries.\n* Proper concordance, listing how the word was translated in other bible verses.\n* Full King James Text is included\n* Click on any blue word for concordance text.\n* Night mode for those that like to read at night (White on black)\n* iPad support\n\nPlease note: This version is not an \"exhaustive\" concordance, and does skip smaller words such as \"and, or, the, a\" as well as some other words. Though we think you'll find it has most (if not all) the words you'll ever need.\n\nWe're open to suggestions for improvement in future versions. Send comments and suggestions to strongs at orionsys.org."

Anyone who works with data can benefit from using R but it is hard to learn. \n\nCreated by scientist and educator Dr Shidan Murphy, R Instructor is a statistical and R reference guide. The application uses plain, non-technical language and over 35 succinct videos to guide new users and reinforce concepts for advanced R users. The number and scope of the videos and content will continue to increase.\n\nR Instructor will teach you how to use R, how to make and modify plots and run statistical tests. Each example includes a very brief (and easy to understand!) description of the function or test, any statistical assumptions, how to structure your data in R, the R scripts (code) and, links to other free and online resources.  Where appropriate, the Mac, Windows and RStudio versions of the R interface are explained separately.\n\nR Instructor also allows you to run RStudio through the web from your iPad or iPhone (Note: This is a public server that requires an internet connection -- do not expect to accomplish serious computing)\n\nIn addition, R Instructor comes complete with 10 Quick Reference guides and the \"Which Test?\" feature. The \"Which Test?\" feature guides you to the correct statistical test after you answer questions related to your data.\n\n\nSee a demonstration of R Instructor at, www.Rinstructor.com\n\nUse R Instructor to...\n\nRun a public web server implementation of RStudio (do not expect serious computing power -- this server is for testing and debugging scripts)\n\n\nLearn R's fundamentals:\n- R's interface\n- Create objects\n- Install libraries\\packages\n- Import and export data and plots\n- Merge data frames\n- Exclude redundant data between datasets\n- Import dates\n- Create custom functions\n- Summarize data frames and matrices\n- Perform calculations\n- and more...\n\nLearn how to make and customize plots:\n- qplots from ggplot2\n- Box plots\n- Bar plots\n- Histograms\n- Line charts\n- Scatter plots and scatter plot matrices\n- Add and customize legends\n- Add custom axis labels\n- Modify the size, shape and colour of point markers\n- Add axis titles\n- Add lines, text or points to an existing plot\n- Add colour to the plot background, border lines… and just about anything else!\n\n\nLearn these (and more) statistical tests:\n- One-sample t-test\n- Two-sample t-test\n- Paired t-test\n- Correlation\n- Rank correlation\n- Linear regression\n- Multiple regression\n- Logistic regression\n- Log-linear models\n- F-test\n- One-way ANOVA\n- Two-way ANOVA\n- One-way repeated measures ANOVA \n- Two-way repeated measures ANOVA  \n- Regression and Classification trees\n- ANCOVA\n- MANOVA\n- Principal Components Analysis\n- Linear discriminant function analysis\n- Redundancy analysis\n- Friedman test\n- Wilcoxon signed rank test\n- Kruskal-Wallis test\n- Chi-square test of independence\n- Binomial test\n- Hierarchical clustering\n- and more…\n\nPlus,\n- Over 35 videos (that's over two hours)\n- 10 Quick Reference Guides\n- The \"Which test?\" feature – An assistant to guide you to the appropriate statistical test"

Search for answers in HSVG, a massive & constantly growing database of equine health info – conveniently available to you “horse side.” \n\nHSVG was created by Doug Thal DVM DABVP, a lifelong horseman & veterinarian that has practiced exclusively equine veterinary medicine for over 20 years & is board certified in equine practice.  \n\nHSVG provides helpful information about equine health from the moment you notice a problem with your horse - My Observation.  It contains practical advice, suggested skills, and questions to discuss with your vet.\n\nHSVG is of value in an emergency and non-emergency, and it helps you distinguish between the two. HSVG also contains dozens of high quality instructional videos, and other media designed to enable you to become an active participant in ensuring your horse’s good health.  \n\nHowever, HSVG is not structured as a simple decision tree that takes you down a singular path based on your input. It is not a substitute for your local equine veterinarian. It does not, and cannot, anticipate and address all of the subtle variations and unique circumstances associated with your horse’s health. That is your veterinarian's job.\n__________________________\n\n- Make better decisions about your horse’s health.\n- Increase the quality of communication between you and your vet.\n- Follow a logical thought process for addressing any equine heath care problem.\n- Utilize a quality alternative to Dr. Google.\n\nOk – so what is Horse Side Vet Guide exactly? \n\nHSVG is a custom-built relational database of equine health information that contains concise information about common problems to rare diseases.  Records are contained in 1 of 9 categories:\n\n- My Observations\n- Vet Diagnostics\n- Vet Diagnoses\n- Vet Treatments\n- My Skills\n- My Supplies\n- Terms & Topics\n- Media\n- Outside Resources\n\nThese records are extensively interlinked, providing a uniquely contextualized approach to any equine health issue. \n\nWe continuously add and update the records in HSVG. We have placed great emphasis on completing the MY OBSERVATIONS records first. You can find \"full access\" records with a keyword search, in the alphabetical browse lists, and hyperlinked inside other records. Incomplete (or \"partial access\") records are listed inside full access records, with no hyperlink. Many other records are hidden from view, and will be available later. After we complete a partial or hidden record we change it to \"full access\" and it becomes immediately available to you after the app has been synchronized to your mobile device. \n\nPlease see our website www.horsesidevetguide.com for more information about this application."

It uses geolocation either via cell tower triangulation, GPS or manual location entry (so you can look up the repeaters you will use on vacation or business trips, etc.).\n\nIf anyone has lists of Amateur Radio repeaters from their countries we would love to incorporate that into our database.\n\nWorldwide IRLP and Echolink nodes.\n\n© ITWeRKS 2011"

      "label": "Listen to and learn hundreds of bird songs and calls from across the continental United States, with up to 34 seconds of song for each bird, and alternative recordings for some birds. \n\nChoose a state or group of states then sort the bird sounds in a variety of ways. Sort by song style to compare birds that hoot and coo, with birds with high pitched songs, or you might like to sort the birds by commonness, so you can listen to the most common ones first, then move on to less frequent backyard visitors. More advanced birders may like to listen to birds from a particular habitat, such as forest or freshwater for example. You can make lists of your favourites so that you can find them quickly.\n\nUse the quiz to test your memory. Answer fast to earn a score multiplier and get on the high score table. Experienced birders can use the custom quiz to help distinguish and learn similar songs. \n\nAnd when you need a rest, try the slideshow feature - choose which birds to include, maybe add background bird song, then simply relax. If you want to continue learning while you relax, switch the voiceover on and hear the name of the bird announced at the end of each clip. This is also a good way of competing with the family - who can say the name of the bird first?\n\nBird names are included in Spanish and French.\n\nProblems? Email us: spiny@spinysoftware.com"

      "label": "SkySafari 6 Pro will revolutionize your astronomical viewing experience.  It has the largest database of any astronomy app, includes every solar system object ever discovered, offers unparalleled accuracy, flawless telescope control, Augmented Reality (AR) mode, and provides the very best experience under the stars when you depend on it. Discover why SkySafari 6 Pro is the #1 recommended astronomy app for serious amateur astronomers since 2009.\n\nHere's what's new in version 6:\n\n1) Complete support for iOS 13 and iPhone 11. We release regular updates.\n\n2) Clouds and Astronomy. Two words that rarely go together. SkySafari 6 Pro will (optionally) back up all of your observing data in our secure cloud storage and make it easily accessible to multiple devices as well as from our new web interface, LiveSky.com.\n\n3) We Have The Best Stars. Precise, modern and deep. We’ve updated our star catalog to use the latest and greatest, UCAC5 star catalog. If 25 million stars down to 15th magnitude isn’t enough for you, an easy in-app purchase gets you down to 16.5 magnitude and a whopping 100 million stars!\n\n4) We Have The Best Galaxies. The PGC catalog includes galaxies down to 18th magnitude. Want more galaxies? How about 2.6 million more? An in-app purchase gives you access to the largest galaxy database available for your device.\n\n5) Observers First. A redesign of our tools puts the active observer first. Quick access to features like your equipment, observing sites, lists, and observations make it easy and enjoyable to get out, observe, and record your observations. The observing sessions feature lets you collect your observations into groups that span a few hours, or a few nights.\n\n6) Graph It. The completely new graph tool will give a quick visual representation of an object’s altitude above the horizon. Essential for planning your night’s observations.\n\n7) Plan It. Make the most of your time under the stars. Our updated planner is a powerful tool that lets you create a list of targets for your observing session with filters like object types, specific time ranges, constellation, catalog, and more. Plan it and get more done.\n\n8) Say It. Ever just wanted to just yell at your device and tell it what to do!? SkySafari 6 adds basic voice control for a wide range of operations. Say “select Jupiter,” “search for Titan,” “center on Polaris” and SkySafari will do the work for you. Yelling optional. \n\n9) Tilt It. Every old astronomy app these days lets your tilt and pan your device to show different parts of the sky, but who else lets you control your telescope that way!? “Tilt to slew” is an optional mode allowing you to keep your eye in the eyepiece, and, using the accelerometers in your device, gently translate the movements of your hands into smooth telescope motion.\n\n10) Share It. SkySafari 6 is more than just a mobile app, it’s a new system to help organize and share your observing experiences. With a free signup, you can see and share your observing data from our web portal, LiveSky.com! Affordable premium memberships add online editing, so you can not only view, but edit your observations, add new observing sites, manage your equipment and more. Finally, (coming soon) you can view, edit and manage your settings files with SkySafari Web, our fully functional web version.\n\nIf you haven't used SkySafari 6 Pro before, here's what you can do with it:\n\n• Hold your device up, and SkySafari 6 Pro will find stars, constellations, planets, and more! The star chart updates automatically with your movements for the ultimate stargazing experience.\n\n• Simulate the night sky up to 10,000 years in the past or future! Animate meteor showers, conjunctions, eclipses, and other celestial events.\n\n• Control your telescope, log and plan your observations.\n\n• Night Vision.\n\n• Orbit Mode. Leave the Earth’s surface behind, and fly through our solar system.\n\n• Galaxy View shows the position of deep sky objects in our Milky Way!\n\n• Much more!"

Once you enter your oxygen supply and a flow rate, your minutes of usable oxygen will be generated.\n\nOxygen Calculation Tool makes it easy to add and delete up to 10 cylinders for both the portable and onboard supply. The user also has the flexibility to enter the flow rate as a free flow setting or from ventilation settings, calculated from the minute ventilation and the FiO2 settings. Optionally, user can also enter ventilator-specific bias flow, if needed. \n\nOxygen Calculation Tool also has a countdown feature. This can be used to time your O2 use with your chosen settings. Using the countdown will update the settings automatically. \n\nThe drip rate calculator can be used to assist you with med math. Enter the supply and dose information and the calculator will determine the rate in ml/hr.\n\nOxygen Calculation Tool contains a reference page, where the math calculation used in this app is outlined, along with a list of oxygen cylinders and associated conversion factors. If you don't see a cylinder size that you need, use the feedback feature found in the settings to let me know and I will try to add it.\n\nThis app is also dark mode compatible. \n\nCalculations are rounded down to the nearest whole minute.\n\n***Please note, this app does NOT subtract 200 psi from initial input to account for residual O2. Some formulas may call for this. If this is desired by users, you can subtract 200 psi from your pressure prior to input."

This means that the Wolfram Tides Calculator can only give historical, present, and future tide information for locations for which there are tide stations. Presently Wolfram|Alpha has information from more than 2,000 tide stations around the world. If you believe that there is a tide station near you, but we are not reporting data from it, please post the location of the tide station, including a URL if possible. For more information on tide predictions see, for example: http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/predhist.html.\n\nThe Wolfram Tides Calculator is powered by the Wolfram|Alpha computational knowledge engine and is created by Wolfram Research, makers of Mathematica—the world's leading software system for mathematical research and education.\n\nThe Wolfram Tides Calculator draws on the computational power of Wolfram|Alpha's supercomputers over a 3G, 4G, or Wi-Fi connection."

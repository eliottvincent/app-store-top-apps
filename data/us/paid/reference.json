      "label": "Find the right word wherever you go. The official RhymeZone iOS app is a fast, powerful rhyming dictionary and thesaurus that you can use anywhere, even if you're not on the net. Quickly find rhymes, near rhymes (including slant rhymes), synonyms, antonyms, homophones, similar sounding words, words with the same consonant pattern, and other related words (generalizations, specializations, words appearing in the same context). Use Apple's local dictionaries or ours online if you are unsure of any meanings.\n\nYou get a database of over 150,000 words and phrases right at your fingertips. Find rhymes without an Internet connection, but if you are online, we'll connect you to RhymeZone.com for definitions and all the other great features you've come to love, ad-free! Or you can look it up on our sister site, OneLook.com, or even hear it pronounced with your device's built-in text-to-speech.\n\nThere's also a nifty \"Poet Maker\" feature, which lets you find words that match constraints on both rhyme and meaning at the same time. For example, suppose you want a word that rhymes with \"cat\" and means \"heavy\"; this feature will answer \"fat\" in no time. Or suppose you're looking for a rhyme of \"curious\" that means \"invalid\"; you'll get \"spurious\". You get the idea!\n\nSo whether you're aspiring to be the next Shakespeare, looking to put on the finishing touches of a love poem, bust out the next rap lyric, or just seeking some clever wordplay for your English assignment, give the app a try!"

Its intrinsic value will not only be of great interest to those studying American heritage and Christian studies, but also to writers and those exploring poetry.\n\nNoah Websters 1828 American Dictionary contains the greatest number of Biblical definitions given in any reference volume. It is an invaluable resource written when American values and patriotism were based on Christian values.\n\nOf interest to poets and writers, The Noah Webster dictionary was used extensively by Emily Dickinson. We know that she made frequent and extensive use of Noah Webster's American Dictionary of the English Language in writing her poems, paying attention not only to the definitions but also to Webster's etymologies and his illustrative quotations.\n\nBeing able to see how definitions have evolved today is fascinating, and a great resource when studying.\n\nYou can easily search or browse the entire dictionary and add favourites to revisit later.\n\nApp design by professional app developer NASDA Studios."

The children of the promise would have forgotten their heritage and identity and all the history that they ought to have known.\n\nThey would now require some extensive hand-holding as they are taken from passage to passage, and the understanding of each line of scripture is ellucidated and taught to them precept by precept.\n\nIf you want to understand the bible, you will need to be guided by the precepts, which are the keys to unlocking the meanings and intents of its passages in context. Let scripture interpret scripture.\n\nSTART LEARNING PRECEPTS NOW!\n- Start by reading the verses and passages related to each precept;\n- Get the understanding of the precept by reading the cross-linked verses;\n- You begin to see the consistency in scripture when you realise that certain words and phrases maintain specific meaning in all the verses they appear in;\n- Connect the dots and you begin to see the bigger picture of what the bible is really revealing.\n\nMORE FEATURES WITH EACH UPDATE\n- Easy navigation for chapters and verses;\n- Quickly check up on precepts listed under a verse, and link to cross-linked verses;\n- Adjust font sizes for accessibility;\n- Use the contact form to send us messages and what you've discovered;\n- Join our mailing list and get updates about our occasional updates and learning aids;\n\nREDISCOVER THE CORRECT WAY TO UNDERSTAND SCRIPTURE\n- Build up entire teaching series using bible precepts to maintain true scriptural meanings and consistency in the understanding delivered.\n\nJoin us on social media and share the gospel to wake up the lost sheep!\nShare this app with friends and family and be part of their awakening."

Search for answers in HSVG, a massive & constantly growing database of equine health info – conveniently available to you “horse side.” \n\nHSVG was created by Doug Thal DVM DABVP, a lifelong horseman & veterinarian that has practiced exclusively equine veterinary medicine for over 20 years & is board certified in equine practice.  \n\nHSVG provides helpful information about equine health from the moment you notice a problem with your horse - My Observation.  It contains practical advice, suggested skills, and questions to discuss with your vet.\n\nHSVG is of value in an emergency and non-emergency, and it helps you distinguish between the two. HSVG also contains dozens of high quality instructional videos, and other media designed to enable you to become an active participant in ensuring your horse’s good health.  \n\nHowever, HSVG is not structured as a simple decision tree that takes you down a singular path based on your input. It is not a substitute for your local equine veterinarian. It does not, and cannot, anticipate and address all of the subtle variations and unique circumstances associated with your horse’s health. That is your veterinarian's job.\n__________________________\n\n- Make better decisions about your horse’s health.\n- Increase the quality of communication between you and your vet.\n- Follow a logical thought process for addressing any equine heath care problem.\n- Utilize a quality alternative to Dr. Google.\n\nOk – so what is Horse Side Vet Guide exactly? \n\nHSVG is a custom-built relational database of equine health information that contains concise information about common problems to rare diseases.  Records are contained in 1 of 9 categories:\n\n- My Observations\n- Vet Diagnostics\n- Vet Diagnoses\n- Vet Treatments\n- My Skills\n- My Supplies\n- Terms & Topics\n- Media\n- Outside Resources\n\nThese records are extensively interlinked, providing a uniquely contextualized approach to any equine health issue. \n\nWe continuously add and update the records in HSVG. We have placed great emphasis on completing the MY OBSERVATIONS records first. You can find \"full access\" records with a keyword search, in the alphabetical browse lists, and hyperlinked inside other records. Incomplete (or \"partial access\") records are listed inside full access records, with no hyperlink. Many other records are hidden from view, and will be available later. After we complete a partial or hidden record we change it to \"full access\" and it becomes immediately available to you after the app has been synchronized to your mobile device. \n\nPlease see our website www.horsesidevetguide.com for more information about this application."

For those who buy specific items repeatedly, this is a “must-have” feature! \nFrom the \"My Favorites\" (Favs button) screen, search for your product, and save it as a “Favorite”, by clicking on the small heart icon (found in the upper right corner of each product entry). Once this is done, it saves it instantly to your Favorites List!\n\nThe next time you want to go shopping for that item, go to your Favorites list by tapping on the “Favs” button at the bottom. It will bring up the “My Favorites” screen, where you can click on that product and bring it up immediately. It is that easy, and makes shopping for yoshon items a breeze!!\n\n——————\n\nTo contact us, choose text, phone, or WhatsApp chatting. The WhatsApp chat goes to the private texting.\n\nWith over 2,200 product entries (and that number is constantly growing), there are plenty of items to choose from that we have yoshon information on. We hope that you will find our exciting new app to be something you just can’t live without!\n\n---------"

Enjoy.\n+ Many more.\n\nIf you haven't used SkySafari 7 Pro before, here's what you can do with it:\n\n+ Hold your device up, and SkySafari 7 Pro will find stars, constellations, planets, and more! The star chart updates automatically with your movements for the ultimate stargazing experience.\n\n+ Simulate the night sky up to 100,000 years in the past or future! Animate meteor showers, conjunctions, eclipses, and other celestial events.\n\n+ Control your telescope, log and plan your observations.\n\n+ Optionally backup all of your observing data in our secure cloud storage and make it easily accessible to multiple devices as well as from our new web interface, LiveSky.com.\n\n+ Augmented Reality (AR) mode\n\n+ Night Vision.\n\n+ Orbit Mode. Leave the Earth’s surface behind, and fly through our solar system.\n\n+ Galaxy View shows the position of deep sky objects in our Milky Way!\n\n+ Much more!"

      "label": "Strong's Concordance, is a concordance of the King James Bible (KJV) that was constructed under the direction of Dr. James Strong (1822–1894) and first published in 1890.\n\nA concordance lets the reader directly compare how the same word may be used else where in the Bible. In this way the Strong's Concordance provides an independent check against translations, and offers an opportunity for greater, and more technically accurate understanding of the Bible text.\n\nWant to see it in action before you buy? Try Strong's Concordance Lite which provides a 100% functional demo of Matthew and Genesis.\n\nThis program does not require internet access, everything you need is all stored on the iDevice.\n\nFeatures:\n* Search for English words, and lookup Greek/Hebrew dictionaries.\n* Proper concordance, listing how the word was translated in other bible verses.\n* Full King James Text is included\n* Click on any blue word for concordance text.\n* Night mode for those that like to read at night (White on black)\n* iPad support\n\nPlease note: This version is not an \"exhaustive\" concordance, and does skip smaller words such as \"and, or, the, a\" as well as some other words. Though we think you'll find it has most (if not all) the words you'll ever need.\n\nWe're open to suggestions for improvement in future versions.

The Moravian Daily Texts has been living this ecumenical dream for many years!\n\nFirst published in 1731 in Saxony, the Daily Texts grew out of a spiritual renewal of the Moravian Church (Unitas Fratrum) that dates back to August 13, 1727. Today, more than 280 years after its first publication, the Daily Texts continues its promise of “a daily message from God that is new every morning.” \n\nThe Moravian Daily Texts offers an inspirational connection to the Holy Scriptures every day. Each entry in this beloved daily devotional includes “watchwords”—Old and New Testament verses to accompany readers throughout the day—combined with heartfelt prayers written by Moravian Church pastors and members from across North America.\n\nEach day, the Daily Texts app offers these verses and prayers, along with links to the full Bible verses in context (note: web access is required for this feature). In addition, the Daily Texts app includes a plan that guides readers through the Psalms in one year and the Old and New Testaments in two years.\n\nFeatures in this app include:\n- Text-to-speech capability, allowing users to hear the Daily Texts read\n- Journaling capability to capture thoughts and insights on each day's Daily Texts\n- Search functions by word or Bible verse\n- Texts for 2017-2023\n- Indicators for favorite Daily Texts and Texts read\n- Notifications\n\nProduced by the Interprovincial Board of Communication of the Moravian Church in America, the texts in this app are contained in the North American printed versions of the Moravian Daily Texts 2023 (note: hymn texts available in the printed versions are not included in this app). The Daily Texts are shared in more than 50 languages around the world.\n\nFor more information about the Moravian Daily Texts, please visit www.moravian.org."

AFV Recognition, or Equipment ID, as it is known in some NATO countries, is the art of identifying what vehicle you see on the battlefield. \n\nThis information not only allows you to stay safer/employ the right effects, but also informs your command of the formation that is in front of you. This vital information, if accurate, not only wins battles - but wins wars.\n\n+ Reconnaissance Vehicles (RECCE/RECON)\n+ Main Battle Tanks (MBTs)\n+ Infantry Fighting Vehicles (IFVs)\n+ Armoured Personnel Carriers (APCs)\n+ Anti-tank vehicles\n+ Artillery\n+ Surface to Air Missiles (SAMs)\n+ Command, Intelligence & Electronic Warfare (CIEW)\n+ Engineer (ENG)\n+ Rotary Wing (RW)\n\n+ Easy to navigate (search functions, favorites and categories)\n\n+ Works offline (first time opening must have a data connection).\n\n+ Over 60 armoured vehicles in current database.\n\n+ Predominantly Russian/Soviet vehicles.\n\n+ Detailed AFV \"cards\" displaying vehicle images, descriptions, weapon systems, types of protection, recognising features and countries in service.\n\n+ Comparison guides to see vehicles side by side.\n\n+ Quiz to test your AFV knowledge - not for the faint of heart.\n\n+ New vehicle packs being released each month (Ukraine Pack - June 2022 / Germany Pack - July 2022 / USA Pack - August 2022 / UK Pack - September 2022)\n\n+ Ongoing project.\n\n+ Brain child of @afv_recognition - the master of AFV guides.\n\nThe AFV Recognition app will revolutionise the study & education of this vast subject.

      "label": "Oxygen Calculation Tool is an app designed with transport medical professionals in mind. Once you enter your oxygen supply and a flow rate, your minutes of usable oxygen will be generated.\n\nOxygen Calculation Tool makes it easy to add and delete up to 10 cylinders for both the portable and onboard supply. The user also has the flexibility to enter the flow rate as a free flow setting or from ventilation settings, calculated from the minute ventilation and the FiO2 settings. Optionally, user can also enter ventilator-specific bias flow, if needed. \n\nOxygen Calculation Tool also has a countdown feature. This can be used to time your O2 use with your chosen settings. Using the countdown will update the settings automatically. \n\nThe drip rate calculator can be used to assist you with med math. Enter the supply and dose information and the calculator will determine the rate in ml/hr.\n\nOxygen Calculation Tool contains a reference page, where the math calculation used in this app is outlined, along with a list of oxygen cylinders and associated conversion factors. If you don't see a cylinder size that you need, use the feedback feature found in the settings to let me know and I will try to add it.\n\nThis app is also dark mode compatible. \n\nCalculations are rounded down to the nearest whole minute.\n\n***Please note, this app does NOT subtract 200 psi from initial input to account for residual O2. Some formulas may call for this. If this is desired by users, you can subtract 200 psi from your pressure prior to input."

      "label": "SkySafari 6 Pro will revolutionize your astronomical viewing experience.  It has the largest database of any astronomy app, includes every solar system object ever discovered, offers unparalleled accuracy, flawless telescope control, Augmented Reality (AR) mode, and provides the very best experience under the stars when you depend on it. Discover why SkySafari 6 Pro is the #1 recommended astronomy app for serious amateur astronomers since 2009.\n\nHere's what's new in version 6:\n\n1) Complete support for iOS 13 and iPhone 11. We release regular updates.\n\n2) Clouds and Astronomy. Two words that rarely go together. SkySafari 6 Pro will (optionally) back up all of your observing data in our secure cloud storage and make it easily accessible to multiple devices as well as from our new web interface, LiveSky.com.\n\n3) We Have The Best Stars. Precise, modern and deep. We’ve updated our star catalog to use the latest and greatest, UCAC5 star catalog. If 25 million stars down to 15th magnitude isn’t enough for you, an easy in-app purchase gets you down to 16.5 magnitude and a whopping 100 million stars!\n\n4) We Have The Best Galaxies. The PGC catalog includes galaxies down to 18th magnitude. Want more galaxies? How about 2.6 million more? An in-app purchase gives you access to the largest galaxy database available for your device.\n\n5) Observers First. A redesign of our tools puts the active observer first. Quick access to features like your equipment, observing sites, lists, and observations make it easy and enjoyable to get out, observe, and record your observations. The observing sessions feature lets you collect your observations into groups that span a few hours, or a few nights.\n\n6) Graph It. The completely new graph tool will give a quick visual representation of an object’s altitude above the horizon. Essential for planning your night’s observations.\n\n7) Plan It. Make the most of your time under the stars. Our updated planner is a powerful tool that lets you create a list of targets for your observing session with filters like object types, specific time ranges, constellation, catalog, and more. Plan it and get more done.\n\n8) Say It. Ever just wanted to just yell at your device and tell it what to do!? SkySafari 6 adds basic voice control for a wide range of operations. Say “select Jupiter,” “search for Titan,” “center on Polaris” and SkySafari will do the work for you. Yelling optional. \n\n9) Tilt It. Every old astronomy app these days lets your tilt and pan your device to show different parts of the sky, but who else lets you control your telescope that way!? “Tilt to slew” is an optional mode allowing you to keep your eye in the eyepiece, and, using the accelerometers in your device, gently translate the movements of your hands into smooth telescope motion.\n\n10) Share It. SkySafari 6 is more than just a mobile app, it’s a new system to help organize and share your observing experiences. With a free signup, you can see and share your observing data from our web portal, LiveSky.com! Affordable premium memberships add online editing, so you can not only view, but edit your observations, add new observing sites, manage your equipment and more. Finally, (coming soon) you can view, edit and manage your settings files with SkySafari Web, our fully functional web version.\n\nIf you haven't used SkySafari 6 Pro before, here's what you can do with it:\n\n• Hold your device up, and SkySafari 6 Pro will find stars, constellations, planets, and more! The star chart updates automatically with your movements for the ultimate stargazing experience.\n\n• Simulate the night sky up to 10,000 years in the past or future! Animate meteor showers, conjunctions, eclipses, and other celestial events.\n\n• Control your telescope, log and plan your observations.\n\n• Night Vision.\n\n• Orbit Mode. Leave the Earth’s surface behind, and fly through our solar system.\n\n• Galaxy View shows the position of deep sky objects in our Milky Way!\n\n• Much more!"

      "label": "THE PREMIER IPAD ATLAS - with RETINA VECTOR MAPS\n\nThe World HD is unique in the app store because it includes both a complete set of country maps AND the largest world fact book.  These enable it to answer questions which Atlases and fact books cannot:  Atlases show you where countries are located, but have very little information about them; fact books tell you about each country, but their maps leave you guessing about where places are located.\n\n\n___________ HOW IT WORKS ___________\n\nThe interface is animated and interactive.  Touch a country on the world map and the Retina vector country map opens while the factbook slides onto the screen, each topic neatly organized as tiles along the edge of the map.  Touch a factbook tile and it zooms out to reveal detailed information about that topic.  Not sure where a country is located?  Select it on the drop-down list and The World HD zooms in on it then opens the map and factbook.\n\nThe zoomable world map is not just the fastest way to select a country it also enables you to visualize and understand entire regions.  It is so intuitive and easy to explore that once you get started it's hard to stop!\n\n\n___________ FEATURES ___________\n\nRETINA VECTOR MAPS\n** Includes high-resolution Retina vector maps for EVERY COUNTRY built-in!  Unlike the other atlases, these maps remain in focus at all magnifications so you can easily see even the smallest detail.  These aren't the CIA maps found in the factbooks, they are used in printed atlases.\n\nMORE INFORMATION\n** Contains geopolitical and demographic information on 300 countries and regions.\n\nNO INTERNET CONNECTION is required\n** Except for live Wikipedia content, all data and maps are built-in\n\nINNOVATIVE FACT BOOK PANEL\n** Presents each section of the fact book as tiles enabling you to quickly find what you need, while keeping the country map in view.\n\nHIGHLY ANIMATED INTERFACE\n** Responds to your touches and gestures so you can quickly find the information you are looking for.\n\nCIA WORLD FACTBOOK\n** This trusted source of current country information is built-in for every country, including sections on: introduction, geography, people, economy, communications, transportation, military, and transnational issues.\n\nWIKIPEDIA\n** View the live, community-written Wikipedia content for each country, island, and remote region within the app.\n\nSHOWS YOU where countries are located\n** Not sure where a country is located?  Select it on the country list and The World zooms to it on the world map and opens the Fact Book Panel\n\nDESIGNED FOR YOUR IPAD & IPHONE\n** Thoughtfully uses the whole screen to present maps and data"

      "label": "Find the right word wherever you go. The official RhymeZone iOS app is a fast, powerful rhyming dictionary and thesaurus that you can use anywhere, even if you're not on the net. Quickly find rhymes, near rhymes (including slant rhymes), synonyms, antonyms, homophones, similar sounding words, words with the same consonant pattern, and other related words (generalizations, specializations, words appearing in the same context). Use Apple's local dictionaries or ours online if you are unsure of any meanings.\n\nYou get a database of over 150,000 words and phrases right at your fingertips. Find rhymes without an Internet connection, but if you are online, we'll connect you to RhymeZone.com for definitions and all the other great features you've come to love, ad-free! Or you can look it up on our sister site, OneLook.com, or even hear it pronounced with your device's built-in text-to-speech.\n\nThere's also a nifty \"Poet Maker\" feature, which lets you find words that match constraints on both rhyme and meaning at the same time. For example, suppose you want a word that rhymes with \"cat\" and means \"heavy\"; this feature will answer \"fat\" in no time. Or suppose you're looking for a rhyme of \"curious\" that means \"invalid\"; you'll get \"spurious\". You get the idea!\n\nSo whether you're aspiring to be the next Shakespeare, looking to put on the finishing touches of a love poem, bust out the next rap lyric, or just seeking some clever wordplay for your English assignment, give the app a try!"

      "label": "This app is a recreation of the Noah Webster 1828 two-volume dictionary. Its intrinsic value will not only be of great interest to those studying American heritage and Christian studies, but also to writers and those exploring poetry.\n\nNoah Websters 1828 American Dictionary contains the greatest number of Biblical definitions given in any reference volume. It is an invaluable resource written when American values and patriotism were based on Christian values.\n\nOf interest to poets and writers, The Noah Webster dictionary was used extensively by Emily Dickinson. We know that she made frequent and extensive use of Noah Webster's American Dictionary of the English Language in writing her poems, paying attention not only to the definitions but also to Webster's etymologies and his illustrative quotations.\n\nBeing able to see how definitions have evolved today is fascinating, and a great resource when studying.\n\nYou can easily search or browse the entire dictionary and add favourites to revisit later.\n\nApp design by professional app developer NASDA Studios."

      "label": "This application is for any gun owner! The purpose of this app is for the legal and conscientious concealed carry license holder to know where they cannot legally carry before getting there. A licensed permit holder or a resident of a constitutional carry state can usually legally carry their firearm in any location other than statutory \"no carry\" locations such as schools, gov. buildings, etc., and in businesses that are posted prohibiting firearms. This is a list of those Posted Anti-Gun businesses. \n\nThis #1-selling app of its kind (both on Apple App Store and other platforms) already includes over 19,000 current anti-gun locations and 17,000 pro-2a alternatives.\n\nFind hotels where you can’t carry before booking a trip to one. Find restaurants where you cannot carry before making dinner plans. Find stores to avoid before you step out the door. It is extremely inconvenient to not find out until you get to a location that they prohibit your second amendment rights. You have to either disarm in the parking lot (causing your vehicle to be a target for thieves) or go somewhere else at the last second. If you know beforehand, you can avoid the places that prohibit carry, or you can leave your firearm at home if you must attend. \n\nWe have a comprehensive list of \"Posted anti-gun\" locations collected in Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin. We have assembled smaller lists in  Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Idaho, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Utah, West Virginia, and Wyoming; provided by many great gun forums and sites with their permission. Since it is crowd-sourced by users like you, please help the list continue to grow!\n\nThe app also includes the option to add pro-gun alternatives that do not prohibit carry.  Search for pro-gun substitutes to the anti-gun businesses.  Easily add new ones to the list every time you experience firearm-friendly (or neutral) service.\n\nThis app includes the easy ability to take action.  Call or email a listed business to let them know your opinion!\n\nLaws regarding signage, and prohibited locations (no sign needed) vary by state. To understand your state’s specific laws, download \"CCW – 50 State Guide\" (http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id443321291). \n\nThis list is user-updated, and will continue to get better over time. But this relies on you! If you go to a place not on the list and they have a sign, please add it with a few clicks via the \"Add a Business\" button! If a place had taken down their sign, get it removed the same way! If you already have a list of anti-gun businesses in your area or state, send us an email. We would love to include any data you have collected, and give you credit for it! \n\nIf you experience any bugs or issues, please email (using the \"Feedback\" button) before leaving app feedback. \n\nDisclaimer: This application implies no warranty regarding the ability to legally carry in any locale or situation and does not constitute legal advice. Every user is responsible for knowing and abiding by the laws in his or her state. Some areas are illegal to carry by statute, even without signage. If unsure, contact local law enforcement or legal counsel. All information provided is simply the opinion of various users who added the location. By downloading and/or purchasing the application, you agree that you assume all risk and are responsible for confirming legality and abiding by all firearm laws. Please see full Disclaimer on Developer Website (below).\n\nThis application was built by Nantz Consulting & Workman Consulting LLC."

      "label": "The Lost Person Behavior App is based upon the Search and Rescue (SAR) international gold standard reference tool on where to look for lost and missing persons. Every Public Safety Official needs to know where the missing person might be, what to ask, where to look, and what to do when minutes matter. The app was built around the field needs of Public Safety Officials.  No matter how remote the location, the app continues to function since no network connection is required, once installed.\n\nThis life-saving information is customized for 41 different subject categories. The categories are organized into a hierarchy of groups including external factors (abductions, aircraft), water incidents (boats and persons in the water), wheeled incidents (ATV, mountain bikes, vehicles, etc.), mental states (autism, dementia, despondent, intellectual disability, mental illness, substance intoxication), children (in five different age groups), and eighteen outdoor activities (hiker, hunter, climber, gatherer, skier, etc.).\n\nThe app guides the user in selecting the correct subject category by several means. The subject category wizard allows the user to select potential scenarios and then will suggest the best match for the subject category.  For example, if a child was riding his bicycle and was then known to be abducted, the user could select Child, Wheel/Motorized, and Abduction; the wizard would suggest using the abduction category. Alternately, the user can go straight to a subject category by using favorites, an alphabetical list, or the hierarchy list. Once the subject category is selected, the Lost Person Behavior App provides the user with: \n•\tbehavioral profiles\n•\ttactical briefings\n•\tspecific investigative questions\n•\tspatial and survival statistics\n•\tsuggestions for initial tasks (reflex tasking).\n\nThe all-new tactical briefings distill the statistics and profiles to the key points that every field searcher must know. The more extensive profile, full statistics, and suggested initial tasks assist even the seasoned search planner. The highly detailed questions for the investigation resulted from decades of SAR experience and thousands of missions.\n\nThe app even allows you to email a checklist of these critical tasks and interview questions so that you may print them out.  The email could also be used for providing remote support or documenting tasks that have been completed.\n\nDetermining where to look is one of the major functions of the search statistics, which are now provided in a graphical and tabular format.  The statistics from thousands of SAR missions allow the search planner to see where similar previous search subjects were found. The SAR statistics include:\n•\tDistance from the Initial Planning Point\n•\tElevation model (likelihood of going up, down, or staying at the same elevation)\n•\tMobility model (how long will the subject keep moving)\n•\tDispersion angle (given a direction of travel, how well does that predict subject’s location)\n•\tTrack Offset model (how far away from a feature such as a road or trail is subject found)\n•\tFind location (at what type of geographic feature was the subject found)\n•\tScenario (what caused the subject to become missing)\n•\tSurvivability overall (what is the overall chance of finding the subject alive or injured)\n•\tSurvivability rate (how does survivability rate change in 24-hour increments).\n\nThe Lost Person Behavior App can be easily customized to only show the statistical information you actually need. The user can customize for ecoregion, terrain, and urban incidents. The user can view the data in both metric and English units. Several additional helpful tools are built into the app. Contextual help is provided on every page with additional information boxes, which explain every element of the app on the page you need.  The information page provides information about the bike wheel model used to describe initial tactical deployment (reflex tasking), a glossary, help, and contact information."

Let scripture interpret scripture.\n\nSTART LEARNING PRECEPTS NOW!\n- Start by reading the verses and passages related to each precept;\n- Get the understanding of the precept by reading the cross-linked verses;\n- You begin to see the consistency in scripture when you realise that certain words and phrases maintain specific meaning in all the verses they appear in;\n- Connect the dots and you begin to see the bigger picture of what the bible is really revealing.\n\nMORE FEATURES WITH EACH UPDATE\n- Easy navigation for chapters and verses;\n- Quickly check up on precepts listed under a verse, and link to cross-linked verses;\n- Adjust font sizes for accessibility;\n- Use the contact form to send us messages and what you've discovered;\n- Join our mailing list and get updates about our occasional updates and learning aids;\n\nREDISCOVER THE CORRECT WAY TO UNDERSTAND SCRIPTURE\n- Build up entire teaching series using bible precepts to maintain true scriptural meanings and consistency in the understanding delivered.\n\nJoin us on social media and share the gospel to wake up the lost sheep!\nShare this app with friends and family and be part of their awakening."

In this way the Strong's Concordance provides an independent check against translations, and offers an opportunity for greater, and more technically accurate understanding of the Bible text.\n\nWant to see it in action before you buy? Try Strong's Concordance Lite which provides a 100% functional demo of Matthew and Genesis.\n\nThis program does not require internet access, everything you need is all stored on the iDevice.\n\nFeatures:\n* Search for English words, and lookup Greek/Hebrew dictionaries.\n* Proper concordance, listing how the word was translated in other bible verses.\n* Full King James Text is included\n* Click on any blue word for concordance text.\n* Night mode for those that like to read at night (White on black)\n* iPad support\n\nPlease note: This version is not an \"exhaustive\" concordance, and does skip smaller words such as \"and, or, the, a\" as well as some other words. Though we think you'll find it has most (if not all) the words you'll ever need.\n\nWe're open to suggestions for improvement in future versions.

It is perhaps the most widely used and admired book for use in rehearsals today – and is now available on your iPhone or iPad to help you find exactly the right action word within seconds.\n\nActors need actions. You cannot act moods. You need to be doing something with every line. You need an aim to achieve, and an action selected to help achieve that aim. ‘Actions’ are active verbs. In order to play a line truthfully, you need to discover the action that suits that particular situation and that particular line. That is where this app comes in…\n\nIt is a fully searchable, easy-to-navigate thesaurus of active verbs, that will help you refine your acting choice until you find the action you require to make each line come alive.\n\nFeatures include:\n\n·  A to Z search, and predictive search function\n·  Emotional groupings to help you pinpoint the action you require\n·  Bookmark, note-making and random word functions\n·  Share your actions on social media or by email\n·  Full instructions on how to use actioning in rehearsal, plus how to use the app\n\nFor actors at all levels and of all ages, Actions: The Actors’ Thesaurus will revolutionise how you rehearse. Once you’ve started using it, you’ll wonder how you ever managed without it.\n\n‘If you want to act, or act better, Actions will take you a long way on the journey to excellence’ Terry Johnson\n\n'Actioning ain't easy – but it's so useful' Zawe Ashton\n\nBased on the bestselling book Actions: The Actors’ Thesaurus by Marina Caldarone and Maggie Lloyd-Williams"

Sort by song style to compare birds that hoot and coo, with birds with high pitched songs, or you might like to sort the birds by commonness, so you can listen to the most common ones first, then move on to less frequent backyard visitors. More advanced birders may like to listen to birds from a particular habitat, such as forest or freshwater for example. You can make lists of your favourites so that you can find them quickly.\n\nUse the quiz to test your memory. Answer fast to earn a score multiplier and get on the high score table. Experienced birders can use the custom quiz to help distinguish and learn similar songs. \n\nAnd when you need a rest, try the slideshow feature - choose which birds to include, maybe add background bird song, then simply relax. If you want to continue learning while you relax, switch the voiceover on and hear the name of the bird announced at the end of each clip. This is also a good way of competing with the family - who can say the name of the bird first?\n\nBird names are included in Spanish and French.\n\nProblems? Email us: spiny@spinysoftware.com"

No more having to lug heavy guidebooks around.\n\nWhen you encounter a bird, you can listen to its pleasing birdsong, then you can let this app work for you. You can browse by name alphabetically or by family, or search by common name, scientific name, or Japanese name.\n\nJapanese name could be convenience when you talk to Japanese bird watcher. e.g. “Red-crowned Crane” is “Tan-cho” in Japanese name. It has also glossary and terminology in Japanese and English.\n\nIf you do not remember or cannot even guess at part of the bird's name, you can use the search function to search by color, size, habitat, or distribution. You can browse through the quickly returned search results, which are sorted by size. Color or habitat search conditions can be set as a filter as you wish.\n\nTo play a sound, simply tap on the sound play button or on the phonetic spelling text. Photographs, life descriptions, and phonetic spelling for voices help you to understand birds effortlessly.\nIn addition, you can let the link function work for you so you do not miss similar sounds.\n\nYou can make your own lists of favorite birds, by season, by site, or in any manner you like. Included are sample lists for Hokkaido(endemic to Hokkaido) and Okinawa(endemic to Okinawa).\n\nThe player function plays sounds from your own list or by family.\n\nYou can use it to simply appreciate your favorite sounds, or to train your ear using blind mode.\n\nText size for menus and descriptions can be set to small or large as you wish. This app is bilingual in Japanese and English, allowing you to enjoy international communication through wild birds.\n\nThe photographs are by Takuya Kanouchi, and the sound recordings and text are by Hideo Ueda. Between them, they have taken a massive number of photographs and recorded many, many sounds over several decades.

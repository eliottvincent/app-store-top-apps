      "label": "Find the right word wherever you go. The official RhymeZone iOS app is a fast, powerful rhyming dictionary and thesaurus that you can use anywhere, even if you're not on the net. Quickly find rhymes, near rhymes (including slant rhymes), synonyms, antonyms, homophones, similar sounding words, words with the same consonant pattern, and other related words (generalizations, specializations, words appearing in the same context). Use Apple's local dictionaries or ours online if you are unsure of any meanings.\n\nYou get a database of over 150,000 words and phrases right at your fingertips. Find rhymes without an Internet connection, but if you are online, we'll connect you to RhymeZone.com for definitions and all the other great features you've come to love, ad-free! Or you can look it up on our sister site, OneLook.com, or even hear it pronounced with your device's built-in text-to-speech.\n\nThere's also a nifty \"Poet Maker\" feature, which lets you find words that match constraints on both rhyme and meaning at the same time. For example, suppose you want a word that rhymes with \"cat\" and means \"heavy\"; this feature will answer \"fat\" in no time. Or suppose you're looking for a rhyme of \"curious\" that means \"invalid\"; you'll get \"spurious\". You get the idea!\n\nSo whether you're aspiring to be the next Shakespeare, looking to put on the finishing touches of a love poem, bust out the next rap lyric, or just seeking some clever wordplay for your English assignment, give the app a try!"

Don’t postpone joy. Discover why SkySafari is the #1 recommended astronomy app for serious amateur astronomers since 2009.\n\nHere's what’s new in version 7:\n\n+ Complete support for iOS 15 and iPhone 13. Version 7 brings a new and immersive stargazing experience.\n\n+ Events Finder - go to the new Events section to unlock a powerful search engine that finds astronomical events visible tonight and far into the future.

SkySafari 7 brings social stargazing to mobile devices with two new features to help you connect with other like minded people.\n\nOneSky - allows you to see what other users are observing, in real time.  This feature highlights objects in the sky chart and indicates with a number how many users are observing a particular object.\n\nSkyCast - allows you to guide a friend or group around the night sky through their own copy of SkySafari. After initiating SkyCast, you can generate a link and conveniently share it with other SkySafari users via text message, apps or social media accounts.\n\n+ Sky Tonight -  jump to the new Tonight section to see what’s visible in your sky tonight.  Expanded information has been designed to help plan your night and includes  Moon & Sun info, calendar curations, events and the best positioned deep sky and solar system objects.\n\n+ Improved Observation Tools - SkySafari is the perfect tool to help you plan, record and organize your observations.  New workflows make it easier to add, search, filter and sort data.\n\nThe Small Touches:\n\n+ You can now edit the Jupiter GRS Longitude Value in the Settings.\n+ Better Moon Age calculation.\n+ New grid & reference options allow you to display Solstice and Equinox markers, Orbit + Node markers for all solar system objects, and tick marks and labels for the Ecliptic, Meridian, and Equator reference lines.\n+ Previous In-app Purchases are Now Free -  this includes the H-R diagram, 3D Galaxy view, and the PGC galaxy and GAIA star catalogs. Enjoy.\n+ Many more.\n\nIf you haven't used SkySafari 7 Pro before, here's what you can do with it:\n\n+ Hold your device up, and SkySafari 7 Pro will find stars, constellations, planets, and more! The star chart updates automatically with your movements for the ultimate stargazing experience.\n\n+ Simulate the night sky up to 100,000 years in the past or future! Animate meteor showers, conjunctions, eclipses, and other celestial events.\n\n+ Control your telescope, log and plan your observations.\n\n+ Optionally backup all of your observing data in our secure cloud storage and make it easily accessible to multiple devices as well as from our new web interface, LiveSky.com.\n\n+ Augmented Reality (AR) mode\n\n+ Night Vision.\n\n+ Orbit Mode. Leave the Earth’s surface behind, and fly through our solar system.\n\n+ Galaxy View shows the position of deep sky objects in our Milky Way!\n\n+ Much more!"

We know that she made frequent and extensive use of Noah Webster's American Dictionary of the English Language in writing her poems, paying attention not only to the definitions but also to Webster's etymologies and his illustrative quotations.\n\nBeing able to see how definitions have evolved today is fascinating, and a great resource when studying.\n\nYou can easily search or browse the entire dictionary and add favourites to revisit later.\n\nApp design by professional app developer NASDA Studios."

      "label": "The Lost Person Behavior App is based upon the Search and Rescue (SAR) international gold standard reference tool on where to look for lost and missing persons. Every Public Safety Official needs to know where the missing person might be, what to ask, where to look, and what to do when minutes matter. The app was built around the field needs of Public Safety Officials.  No matter how remote the location, the app continues to function since no network connection is required, once installed.\n\nThis life-saving information is customized for 41 different subject categories. The categories are organized into a hierarchy of groups including external factors (abductions, aircraft), water incidents (boats and persons in the water), wheeled incidents (ATV, mountain bikes, vehicles, etc.), mental states (autism, dementia, despondent, intellectual disability, mental illness, substance intoxication), children (in five different age groups), and eighteen outdoor activities (hiker, hunter, climber, gatherer, skier, etc.).\n\nThe app guides the user in selecting the correct subject category by several means. The subject category wizard allows the user to select potential scenarios and then will suggest the best match for the subject category.  For example, if a child was riding his bicycle and was then known to be abducted, the user could select Child, Wheel/Motorized, and Abduction; the wizard would suggest using the abduction category. Alternately, the user can go straight to a subject category by using favorites, an alphabetical list, or the hierarchy list. Once the subject category is selected, the Lost Person Behavior App provides the user with: \n•\tbehavioral profiles\n•\ttactical briefings\n•\tspecific investigative questions\n•\tspatial and survival statistics\n•\tsuggestions for initial tasks (reflex tasking).\n\nThe all-new tactical briefings distill the statistics and profiles to the key points that every field searcher must know. The more extensive profile, full statistics, and suggested initial tasks assist even the seasoned search planner. The highly detailed questions for the investigation resulted from decades of SAR experience and thousands of missions.\n\nThe app even allows you to email a checklist of these critical tasks and interview questions so that you may print them out.  The email could also be used for providing remote support or documenting tasks that have been completed.\n\nDetermining where to look is one of the major functions of the search statistics, which are now provided in a graphical and tabular format.  The statistics from thousands of SAR missions allow the search planner to see where similar previous search subjects were found. The SAR statistics include:\n•\tDistance from the Initial Planning Point\n•\tElevation model (likelihood of going up, down, or staying at the same elevation)\n•\tMobility model (how long will the subject keep moving)\n•\tDispersion angle (given a direction of travel, how well does that predict subject’s location)\n•\tTrack Offset model (how far away from a feature such as a road or trail is subject found)\n•\tFind location (at what type of geographic feature was the subject found)\n•\tScenario (what caused the subject to become missing)\n•\tSurvivability overall (what is the overall chance of finding the subject alive or injured)\n•\tSurvivability rate (how does survivability rate change in 24-hour increments).\n\nThe Lost Person Behavior App can be easily customized to only show the statistical information you actually need. The user can customize for ecoregion, terrain, and urban incidents. The user can view the data in both metric and English units. Several additional helpful tools are built into the app. Contextual help is provided on every page with additional information boxes, which explain every element of the app on the page you need.  The information page provides information about the bike wheel model used to describe initial tactical deployment (reflex tasking), a glossary, help, and contact information."

This vital information, if accurate, not only wins battles - but wins wars.\n\n+ Reconnaissance Vehicles (RECCE/RECON)\n+ Main Battle Tanks (MBTs)\n+ Infantry Fighting Vehicles (IFVs)\n+ Armoured Personnel Carriers (APCs)\n+ Anti-tank vehicles\n+ Artillery\n+ Surface to Air Missiles (SAMs)\n+ Command, Intelligence & Electronic Warfare (CIEW)\n+ Engineer (ENG)\n+ Rotary Wing (RW)\n\n+ Easy to navigate (search functions, favorites and categories)\n\n+ Works offline (first time opening must have a data connection).\n\n+ Over 60 armoured vehicles in current database.\n\n+ Predominantly Russian/Soviet vehicles.\n\n+ Detailed AFV \"cards\" displaying vehicle images, descriptions, weapon systems, types of protection, recognising features and countries in service.\n\n+ Comparison guides to see vehicles side by side.\n\n+ Quiz to test your AFV knowledge - not for the faint of heart.\n\n+ New vehicle packs being released each month (Ukraine Pack - June 2022 / Germany Pack - July 2022 / USA Pack - August 2022 / UK Pack - September 2022)\n\n+ Ongoing project.\n\n+ Brain child of @afv_recognition - the master of AFV guides.\n\nThe AFV Recognition app will revolutionise the study & education of this vast subject. A must have for any serving military, aspiring military, military training establishments and all armoured vehicle enthusiasts."

The children of the promise would have forgotten their heritage and identity and all the history that they ought to have known.\n\nThey would now require some extensive hand-holding as they are taken from passage to passage, and the understanding of each line of scripture is ellucidated and taught to them precept by precept.\n\nIf you want to understand the bible, you will need to be guided by the precepts, which are the keys to unlocking the meanings and intents of its passages in context. Let scripture interpret scripture.\n\nSTART LEARNING PRECEPTS NOW!\n- Start by reading the verses and passages related to each precept;\n- Get the understanding of the precept by reading the cross-linked verses;\n- You begin to see the consistency in scripture when you realise that certain words and phrases maintain specific meaning in all the verses they appear in;\n- Connect the dots and you begin to see the bigger picture of what the bible is really revealing.\n\nMORE FEATURES WITH EACH UPDATE\n- Easy navigation for chapters and verses;\n- Quickly check up on precepts listed under a verse, and link to cross-linked verses;\n- Adjust font sizes for accessibility;\n- Use the contact form to send us messages and what you've discovered;\n- Join our mailing list and get updates about our occasional updates and learning aids;\n\nREDISCOVER THE CORRECT WAY TO UNDERSTAND SCRIPTURE\n- Build up entire teaching series using bible precepts to maintain true scriptural meanings and consistency in the understanding delivered.\n\nJoin us on social media and share the gospel to wake up the lost sheep!\nShare this app with friends and family and be part of their awakening."

      "label": "SkySafari 6 Pro will revolutionize your astronomical viewing experience.  It has the largest database of any astronomy app, includes every solar system object ever discovered, offers unparalleled accuracy, flawless telescope control, Augmented Reality (AR) mode, and provides the very best experience under the stars when you depend on it. Discover why SkySafari 6 Pro is the #1 recommended astronomy app for serious amateur astronomers since 2009.\n\nHere's what's new in version 6:\n\n1) Complete support for iOS 13 and iPhone 11. We release regular updates.\n\n2) Clouds and Astronomy. Two words that rarely go together. SkySafari 6 Pro will (optionally) back up all of your observing data in our secure cloud storage and make it easily accessible to multiple devices as well as from our new web interface, LiveSky.com.\n\n3) We Have The Best Stars. Precise, modern and deep. We’ve updated our star catalog to use the latest and greatest, UCAC5 star catalog. If 25 million stars down to 15th magnitude isn’t enough for you, an easy in-app purchase gets you down to 16.5 magnitude and a whopping 100 million stars!\n\n4) We Have The Best Galaxies. The PGC catalog includes galaxies down to 18th magnitude. Want more galaxies? How about 2.6 million more? An in-app purchase gives you access to the largest galaxy database available for your device.\n\n5) Observers First. A redesign of our tools puts the active observer first. Quick access to features like your equipment, observing sites, lists, and observations make it easy and enjoyable to get out, observe, and record your observations. The observing sessions feature lets you collect your observations into groups that span a few hours, or a few nights.\n\n6) Graph It. The completely new graph tool will give a quick visual representation of an object’s altitude above the horizon. Essential for planning your night’s observations.\n\n7) Plan It. Make the most of your time under the stars. Our updated planner is a powerful tool that lets you create a list of targets for your observing session with filters like object types, specific time ranges, constellation, catalog, and more. Plan it and get more done.\n\n8) Say It. Ever just wanted to just yell at your device and tell it what to do!? SkySafari 6 adds basic voice control for a wide range of operations. Say “select Jupiter,” “search for Titan,” “center on Polaris” and SkySafari will do the work for you. Yelling optional. \n\n9) Tilt It. Every old astronomy app these days lets your tilt and pan your device to show different parts of the sky, but who else lets you control your telescope that way!? “Tilt to slew” is an optional mode allowing you to keep your eye in the eyepiece, and, using the accelerometers in your device, gently translate the movements of your hands into smooth telescope motion.\n\n10) Share It. SkySafari 6 is more than just a mobile app, it’s a new system to help organize and share your observing experiences. With a free signup, you can see and share your observing data from our web portal, LiveSky.com! Affordable premium memberships add online editing, so you can not only view, but edit your observations, add new observing sites, manage your equipment and more. Finally, (coming soon) you can view, edit and manage your settings files with SkySafari Web, our fully functional web version.\n\nIf you haven't used SkySafari 6 Pro before, here's what you can do with it:\n\n• Hold your device up, and SkySafari 6 Pro will find stars, constellations, planets, and more! The star chart updates automatically with your movements for the ultimate stargazing experience.\n\n• Simulate the night sky up to 10,000 years in the past or future! Animate meteor showers, conjunctions, eclipses, and other celestial events.\n\n• Control your telescope, log and plan your observations.\n\n• Night Vision.\n\n• Orbit Mode. Leave the Earth’s surface behind, and fly through our solar system.\n\n• Galaxy View shows the position of deep sky objects in our Milky Way!\n\n• Much more!"

The SDA Church Manual is very useful to all SDA Church Members and Leaders and other people who want to know more about Jesus and His Church the Seventh Day Adventist Church.\n\nFeatures :\n\n-\tFriendly interface\n-\tSearch any key word through the whole book\n- Support many languages : English, French, Spanish\n-\tZoom\n-\tWork offline\n-\tSelect the text to share it with your friends through e-mail, WhatsApp, Facebook\n-\tMore features to come with updates\n\n\nWhy does the Seventh-day Adventist Church have a Church Manual? God is a God of order as evidenced in His works of creation and redemption. Consequently, order belongs to the essence of His church. Order is achieved through principles and regulations that guide the Church in its internal operations and in fulfillmenting its mission to the world. In order for it to be a successful ecclesiastical organization at the service of the Lord and humanity, it needs order, rule, and discipline. Scripture affirms that “all things be done decently and in order” (1 Cor. 14:40)."

No internet connection needed, so it can be in your pocket as you travel through Maya ruins and use it to calculate the Gregorian calendar dates from Maya long counts on monuments.\n\nMaya Calendar gives you the Maya calendar date for today or any date in history – past, present, and future.  Convert dates back and forth between the Maya and Gregorian calendars, learn about the various Maya cycles of time, and gain a better understanding of why December 21, 2012 A.D. is an important Maya date.\n\nIn addition, this app can calculate your birthday in the Maya sacred calendar and learn what it says about your personality traits and destiny.\n\nMaya Calendar offers these great features:\n\n– The Home Page displays the current day in the Maya Calendar, both in hieroglyphs and in modern text formats.\n\n– “This Day in Maya History” cites a major event in Maya history for almost every day of the year.\n\n–  The “Maya Calendars” section provides a detailed explanation of each of the major Maya calendrical cycles, a discussion of the calendar correlation debate, and the thinking behind the possible end date of 2012 A.D.\n\n– The “Calculator” allows you to convert any Gregorian date into its Maya calendar equivalent.\n\n– The “Long Count” feature allows you to convert any Maya Long Count date into its Gregorian calendar equivalent. \n\n– The “Birthdays” feature allows you to calculate and store the Maya birthdays of everyone you know. Once calculated, the app provides a host of information about that individual: personality traits; animal, color, and directional associations; and events in Maya history that occurred on the same date as their birth.\n\n– The “Known Birthdays” feature lists and saves the names of everyone whose Maya birthday you have recorded and notifies you when their birthday comes around.\n\n– “What to Do Today” lists the activities that modern Maya calendar priests recommend for any given day.\n\nMaya Calendar, created by Dr. Ed Barnhart, is an invaluable tool for students investigating Maya inscriptions, and for anyone fascinated with the workings of the Maya calendar."

Search for answers in HSVG, a massive & constantly growing database of equine health info – conveniently available to you “horse side.” \n\nHSVG was created by Doug Thal DVM DABVP, a lifelong horseman & veterinarian that has practiced exclusively equine veterinary medicine for over 20 years & is board certified in equine practice.  \n\nHSVG provides helpful information about equine health from the moment you notice a problem with your horse - My Observation.  It contains practical advice, suggested skills, and questions to discuss with your vet.\n\nHSVG is of value in an emergency and non-emergency, and it helps you distinguish between the two. HSVG also contains dozens of high quality instructional videos, and other media designed to enable you to become an active participant in ensuring your horse’s good health.  \n\nHowever, HSVG is not structured as a simple decision tree that takes you down a singular path based on your input. It is not a substitute for your local equine veterinarian. It does not, and cannot, anticipate and address all of the subtle variations and unique circumstances associated with your horse’s health. That is your veterinarian's job.\n__________________________\n\n- Make better decisions about your horse’s health.\n- Increase the quality of communication between you and your vet.\n- Follow a logical thought process for addressing any equine heath care problem.\n- Utilize a quality alternative to Dr. Google.\n\nOk – so what is Horse Side Vet Guide exactly? \n\nHSVG is a custom-built relational database of equine health information that contains concise information about common problems to rare diseases.  Records are contained in 1 of 9 categories:\n\n- My Observations\n- Vet Diagnostics\n- Vet Diagnoses\n- Vet Treatments\n- My Skills\n- My Supplies\n- Terms & Topics\n- Media\n- Outside Resources\n\nThese records are extensively interlinked, providing a uniquely contextualized approach to any equine health issue. \n\nWe continuously add and update the records in HSVG. We have placed great emphasis on completing the MY OBSERVATIONS records first. You can find \"full access\" records with a keyword search, in the alphabetical browse lists, and hyperlinked inside other records. Incomplete (or \"partial access\") records are listed inside full access records, with no hyperlink. Many other records are hidden from view, and will be available later. After we complete a partial or hidden record we change it to \"full access\" and it becomes immediately available to you after the app has been synchronized to your mobile device. \n\nPlease see our website www.horsesidevetguide.com for more information about this application."

      "label": "Whether you are on a short trip to Thailand or living there, communicate with Thais instantly!  12,000+ ready-to-use, customizable phrases in 250+ practical categories.  Clear native sounds for every Thai word—even offline.  Full-text search or dictate words in English or Thai.  Haggle using the built-in translating units/currency converter.  Favorites screen organizes phrases you use often in multiple folders.  Comprehensive guide to Thai Speaking/Listening. No knowledge of Thai required (shows both Thai Script and 12 English-like pronunciation systems).  The essential conversation guidebook that talks for you!\n\nFully supports iOS 7/8; full-screen on iPhone 4/5/6/6+ and all iPads.\n\n== Useful Vocabulary for both Tourists and Expats\n\nThis phrasebook + mini-dictionary app is in a league of its own, with full-text search access to more than 12,000 professionally edited words, phrases, and ready-to-use, customizable complete sentences organized into 250+ practical categories like “Language Difficulties,” “Hotel,” “Renting a Place,” “Food/Drink,” “Price Haggling,” “Transportation,” “Health,” “Shopping,” “Sightseeing,” “Love/Romance/Sex” and even “Swearing/Insults.”  \n\nEntries are richly annotated for native English speakers so you know the exact meaning of each Thai word and phrase you use, including slang and formal variants.  No more Google Translate gibberish!\n\nClean layout shows multiple complete entries at once with Thai and English text as big as you want—no more reading glasses.\n\n== Customizable Super Phrases\n\nUnlike traditional phrasebooks and apps that give you limited phrase choices (e.g. “Take me to the bus station” but not “Take me to the airport,” or “I will arrive at 2:00” but not “I will arrive at 3:30 on Friday”) our phrasebook app features hundreds of industry-first “super phrases” that let you customize part of the phrase to your needs and get instant translation and playback of the full sentence in Thai, complete with a talking translator calculator, currency conversion, and units conversion (including Rai for buying Thai land) built right in the phrases themselves!  Haggle with a vendor in your language and your currency and instantly convert to hers so she understands you.  \n\n== Native Thai Sound Recordings\n\nTouch any Thai word/phrase in any of our 12,000+ entries to hear a high-quality sound recording of a native speaker, not a toneless gravelly robot as found in other software. More than 5 hours of studio-recorded sound included!\n\n== No Internet Connection Required\n\nWorks even when you're in a taxi, plane, or countryside street market and not connected to the internet: all entries and sounds are stored right on your device.\n\nWhen you are online, you or your Thai friend can even speak English (iOS5+) or Thai (iOS8+) words right into your device to search the phrasebook (voice recognition requires at least iPhone 4S, 5th Gen iPod Touch, 3rd Gen iPad or any iPad Mini).\n\n== No Thai Knowledge Required\n\nPerfect even for beginners who cannot read Thai Script and have no time to study Thai.  You can search for any Thai word you hear by its sound using an English-like phonetic alphabet.  All Thai words in every screen are written using both Thai Script and your choice of 12 popular pronunciation/transliteration systems.\n\nFor those who want to go deeper, our app includes a comprehensive, interactive introduction to the Thai language where you can learn to speak and recognize the sounds of Thai (even the tones) and learn to put together your own sentences in Thai.\n\n== Note to Current Dictionary App Customers\n\nA HUGE thanks to the many of you who are choosing to buy our new phrasebook app today to get the new content instantly and to support future development.  As we announced in 2014, we plan to add all the phrasebook content and features to the dictionary app in late 2015.\n\n== Buy it Now!\n\nDon't go another day without this indispensable tool! Enjoy free lifetime upgrades as we add more phrases and features."

Quickly find rhymes, near rhymes (including slant rhymes), synonyms, antonyms, homophones, similar sounding words, words with the same consonant pattern, and other related words (generalizations, specializations, words appearing in the same context). Use Apple's local dictionaries or ours online if you are unsure of any meanings.\n\nYou get a database of over 150,000 words and phrases right at your fingertips. Find rhymes without an Internet connection, but if you are online, we'll connect you to RhymeZone.com for definitions and all the other great features you've come to love, ad-free! Or you can look it up on our sister site, OneLook.com, or even hear it pronounced with your device's built-in text-to-speech.\n\nThere's also a nifty \"Poet Maker\" feature, which lets you find words that match constraints on both rhyme and meaning at the same time. For example, suppose you want a word that rhymes with \"cat\" and means \"heavy\"; this feature will answer \"fat\" in no time. Or suppose you're looking for a rhyme of \"curious\" that means \"invalid\"; you'll get \"spurious\". You get the idea!\n\nSo whether you're aspiring to be the next Shakespeare, looking to put on the finishing touches of a love poem, bust out the next rap lyric, or just seeking some clever wordplay for your English assignment, give the app a try!"

      "label": "This application is for any gun owner! The purpose of this app is for the legal and conscientious concealed carry license holder to know where they cannot legally carry before getting there. A licensed permit holder or a resident of a constitutional carry state can usually legally carry their firearm in any location other than statutory \"no carry\" locations such as schools, gov. buildings, etc., and in businesses that are posted prohibiting firearms. This is a list of those Posted Anti-Gun businesses. \n\nThis #1-selling app of its kind (both on Apple App Store and other platforms) already includes over 19,000 current anti-gun locations and 17,000 pro-2a alternatives.\n\nFind hotels where you can’t carry before booking a trip to one. Find restaurants where you cannot carry before making dinner plans. Find stores to avoid before you step out the door. It is extremely inconvenient to not find out until you get to a location that they prohibit your second amendment rights. You have to either disarm in the parking lot (causing your vehicle to be a target for thieves) or go somewhere else at the last second. If you know beforehand, you can avoid the places that prohibit carry, or you can leave your firearm at home if you must attend. \n\nWe have a comprehensive list of \"Posted anti-gun\" locations collected in Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin. We have assembled smaller lists in  Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Idaho, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Utah, West Virginia, and Wyoming; provided by many great gun forums and sites with their permission. Since it is crowd-sourced by users like you, please help the list continue to grow!\n\nThe app also includes the option to add pro-gun alternatives that do not prohibit carry.  Search for pro-gun substitutes to the anti-gun businesses.  Easily add new ones to the list every time you experience firearm-friendly (or neutral) service.\n\nThis app includes the easy ability to take action.  Call or email a listed business to let them know your opinion!\n\nLaws regarding signage, and prohibited locations (no sign needed) vary by state. To understand your state’s specific laws, download \"CCW – 50 State Guide\" (http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id443321291). \n\nThis list is user-updated, and will continue to get better over time. But this relies on you! If you go to a place not on the list and they have a sign, please add it with a few clicks via the \"Add a Business\" button! If a place had taken down their sign, get it removed the same way! If you already have a list of anti-gun businesses in your area or state, send us an email. We would love to include any data you have collected, and give you credit for it! \n\nIf you experience any bugs or issues, please email (using the \"Feedback\" button) before leaving app feedback. \n\nDisclaimer: This application implies no warranty regarding the ability to legally carry in any locale or situation and does not constitute legal advice. Every user is responsible for knowing and abiding by the laws in his or her state. Some areas are illegal to carry by statute, even without signage. If unsure, contact local law enforcement or legal counsel. All information provided is simply the opinion of various users who added the location. By downloading and/or purchasing the application, you agree that you assume all risk and are responsible for confirming legality and abiding by all firearm laws. Please see full Disclaimer on Developer Website (below).\n\nThis application was built by Nantz Consulting & Workman Consulting LLC."

      "label": "This app is a recreation of the Noah Webster 1828 two-volume dictionary. Its intrinsic value will not only be of great interest to those studying American heritage and Christian studies, but also to writers and those exploring poetry.\n\nNoah Websters 1828 American Dictionary contains the greatest number of Biblical definitions given in any reference volume. It is an invaluable resource written when American values and patriotism were based on Christian values.\n\nOf interest to poets and writers, The Noah Webster dictionary was used extensively by Emily Dickinson. We know that she made frequent and extensive use of Noah Webster's American Dictionary of the English Language in writing her poems, paying attention not only to the definitions but also to Webster's etymologies and his illustrative quotations.\n\nBeing able to see how definitions have evolved today is fascinating, and a great resource when studying.\n\nYou can easily search or browse the entire dictionary and add favourites to revisit later.\n\nApp design by professional app developer NASDA Studios."

Search for answers in HSVG, a massive & constantly growing database of equine health info – conveniently available to you “horse side.” \n\nHSVG was created by Doug Thal DVM DABVP, a lifelong horseman & veterinarian that has practiced exclusively equine veterinary medicine for over 20 years & is board certified in equine practice.  \n\nHSVG provides helpful information about equine health from the moment you notice a problem with your horse - My Observation.  It contains practical advice, suggested skills, and questions to discuss with your vet.\n\nHSVG is of value in an emergency and non-emergency, and it helps you distinguish between the two. HSVG also contains dozens of high quality instructional videos, and other media designed to enable you to become an active participant in ensuring your horse’s good health.  \n\nHowever, HSVG is not structured as a simple decision tree that takes you down a singular path based on your input. It is not a substitute for your local equine veterinarian. It does not, and cannot, anticipate and address all of the subtle variations and unique circumstances associated with your horse’s health. That is your veterinarian's job.\n__________________________\n\n- Make better decisions about your horse’s health.\n- Increase the quality of communication between you and your vet.\n- Follow a logical thought process for addressing any equine heath care problem.\n- Utilize a quality alternative to Dr. Google.\n\nOk – so what is Horse Side Vet Guide exactly? \n\nHSVG is a custom-built relational database of equine health information that contains concise information about common problems to rare diseases.  Records are contained in 1 of 9 categories:\n\n- My Observations\n- Vet Diagnostics\n- Vet Diagnoses\n- Vet Treatments\n- My Skills\n- My Supplies\n- Terms & Topics\n- Media\n- Outside Resources\n\nThese records are extensively interlinked, providing a uniquely contextualized approach to any equine health issue. \n\nWe continuously add and update the records in HSVG. We have placed great emphasis on completing the MY OBSERVATIONS records first. You can find \"full access\" records with a keyword search, in the alphabetical browse lists, and hyperlinked inside other records. Incomplete (or \"partial access\") records are listed inside full access records, with no hyperlink. Many other records are hidden from view, and will be available later. After we complete a partial or hidden record we change it to \"full access\" and it becomes immediately available to you after the app has been synchronized to your mobile device. \n\nPlease see our website www.horsesidevetguide.com for more information about this application."

      "label": "The Lost Person Behavior App is based upon the Search and Rescue (SAR) international gold standard reference tool on where to look for lost and missing persons. Every Public Safety Official needs to know where the missing person might be, what to ask, where to look, and what to do when minutes matter. The app was built around the field needs of Public Safety Officials.  No matter how remote the location, the app continues to function since no network connection is required, once installed.\n\nThis life-saving information is customized for 41 different subject categories. The categories are organized into a hierarchy of groups including external factors (abductions, aircraft), water incidents (boats and persons in the water), wheeled incidents (ATV, mountain bikes, vehicles, etc.), mental states (autism, dementia, despondent, intellectual disability, mental illness, substance intoxication), children (in five different age groups), and eighteen outdoor activities (hiker, hunter, climber, gatherer, skier, etc.).\n\nThe app guides the user in selecting the correct subject category by several means. The subject category wizard allows the user to select potential scenarios and then will suggest the best match for the subject category.  For example, if a child was riding his bicycle and was then known to be abducted, the user could select Child, Wheel/Motorized, and Abduction; the wizard would suggest using the abduction category. Alternately, the user can go straight to a subject category by using favorites, an alphabetical list, or the hierarchy list. Once the subject category is selected, the Lost Person Behavior App provides the user with: \n•\tbehavioral profiles\n•\ttactical briefings\n•\tspecific investigative questions\n•\tspatial and survival statistics\n•\tsuggestions for initial tasks (reflex tasking).\n\nThe all-new tactical briefings distill the statistics and profiles to the key points that every field searcher must know. The more extensive profile, full statistics, and suggested initial tasks assist even the seasoned search planner. The highly detailed questions for the investigation resulted from decades of SAR experience and thousands of missions.\n\nThe app even allows you to email a checklist of these critical tasks and interview questions so that you may print them out.  The email could also be used for providing remote support or documenting tasks that have been completed.\n\nDetermining where to look is one of the major functions of the search statistics, which are now provided in a graphical and tabular format.  The statistics from thousands of SAR missions allow the search planner to see where similar previous search subjects were found. The SAR statistics include:\n•\tDistance from the Initial Planning Point\n•\tElevation model (likelihood of going up, down, or staying at the same elevation)\n•\tMobility model (how long will the subject keep moving)\n•\tDispersion angle (given a direction of travel, how well does that predict subject’s location)\n•\tTrack Offset model (how far away from a feature such as a road or trail is subject found)\n•\tFind location (at what type of geographic feature was the subject found)\n•\tScenario (what caused the subject to become missing)\n•\tSurvivability overall (what is the overall chance of finding the subject alive or injured)\n•\tSurvivability rate (how does survivability rate change in 24-hour increments).\n\nThe Lost Person Behavior App can be easily customized to only show the statistical information you actually need. The user can customize for ecoregion, terrain, and urban incidents. The user can view the data in both metric and English units. Several additional helpful tools are built into the app. Contextual help is provided on every page with additional information boxes, which explain every element of the app on the page you need.  The information page provides information about the bike wheel model used to describe initial tactical deployment (reflex tasking), a glossary, help, and contact information."

The SDA Church Manual is very useful to all SDA Church Members and Leaders and other people who want to know more about Jesus and His Church the Seventh Day Adventist Church.\n\nFeatures :\n\n-\tFriendly interface\n-\tSearch any key word through the whole book\n- Support many languages : English, French, Spanish\n-\tZoom\n-\tWork offline\n-\tSelect the text to share it with your friends through e-mail, WhatsApp, Facebook\n-\tMore features to come with updates\n\n\nWhy does the Seventh-day Adventist Church have a Church Manual? God is a God of order as evidenced in His works of creation and redemption. Consequently, order belongs to the essence of His church. Order is achieved through principles and regulations that guide the Church in its internal operations and in fulfillmenting its mission to the world. In order for it to be a successful ecclesiastical organization at the service of the Lord and humanity, it needs order, rule, and discipline. Scripture affirms that “all things be done decently and in order” (1 Cor. 14:40)."

      "label": "Oxygen Calculation Tool is an app designed with transport medical professionals in mind. Once you enter your oxygen supply and a flow rate, your minutes of usable oxygen will be generated.\n\nOxygen Calculation Tool makes it easy to add and delete up to 10 cylinders for both the portable and onboard supply. The user also has the flexibility to enter the flow rate as a free flow setting or from ventilation settings, calculated from the minute ventilation and the FiO2 settings. Optionally, user can also enter ventilator-specific bias flow, if needed. \n\nOxygen Calculation Tool also has a countdown feature. This can be used to time your O2 use with your chosen settings. Using the countdown will update the settings automatically. \n\nThe drip rate calculator can be used to assist you with med math. Enter the supply and dose information and the calculator will determine the rate in ml/hr.\n\nOxygen Calculation Tool contains a reference page, where the math calculation used in this app is outlined, along with a list of oxygen cylinders and associated conversion factors. If you don't see a cylinder size that you need, use the feedback feature found in the settings to let me know and I will try to add it.\n\nThis app is also dark mode compatible. \n\nCalculations are rounded down to the nearest whole minute.\n\n***Please note, this app does NOT subtract 200 psi from initial input to account for residual O2. Some formulas may call for this. If this is desired by users, you can subtract 200 psi from your pressure prior to input."

It is the quickest version of the MUTCD ever created!  Perfect for the civil engineer, contractor, or public works employee in the field.  It includes a custom designed interface with features never implemented before.  Features include:\n\n* Drill-down tables to find text, individual signs, figures and tables. The entire manual is in the app. Hyperlinks are provided in text to all corresponding figures and tables.  It has never been easier!\n\n* Text based search for Chapters, Sections, Signs, Tables and Figure titles.  Find all traffic signs by keyword or MUTCD code. For example, type in “Truck” for the signs tab, and see all signs with “Truck” in the title. Type in “R1-1”, and it shows the stop sign with touch based access to the corresponding section.\n\n* The sign tab includes a copyrighted, sign index with high-resolution graphics that is superior to all others!  Federal MUTCD signs are shown that allow one to touch the sign to reveal the relevant section.  You can visually search by sign type or show all MUTCD signs in the same drill-down table.  Over 800+ signs are available!\n\nA demonstration of the above features is available on YouTube at\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykH88PYkaAI\n\nThe MUTCD is in the initial stages of evolving to something much more than a simple PDF.  See the first stage of this evolution today!\n\nIt would be appreciated if you could rate the MUTCD app after using it.  All comments are appreciated."

The app, which contains 228 species of Hawaiian birds and 169 species of Palauan birds offers all the features that contribute to making iBird the most popular birding app in the world. Like our top of the line iBird Ultimate app, iBird Hawaii and Palau offers the popular Birds Around Me (BAM) GPS feature as well as the Percevia™ Smart Search feature.  \n\nMore Details of What’s New: bit.ly/ibird-whatsnew\n\nIn 2008 iBird broke new ground as it turned the iPhone into a field guide app that identifies birds and plays their songs. Featured in Apple’s television commercials, it started a revolution that made iBird the most respected birding app in the world. \n\n** NOTE If you would like to try out iBird at no expense, check the newly released iBird LITE Free Guide to Birds of North America. It contains all the features of paid iBird Ultimate, but includes just 50 species. And it’s completely FREE. **\n\nWhether you are an experienced birder or a beginner, iBird Hawaii and Palau is the most authoritative guide to these exotic birds. \n\nFeatures\n\n■ Separate databases for Hawaii and Palau allow doing independent searching and identification as well as separate species accounts and song libraries. \n\n■ Birds Around Me (BAM) narrows the species being searched to just those found at your GPS location, within a radius and season you specify. \n\n■ Percevia™ intelligent search is a patented algorithm that guarantees you will only choose search attributes that narrow the matched list of birds. \n\n■ iBird now takes advantage of the high-resolution retina displays of the iPhone and iPad so the screen shows more information than ever.\n\n■ Contains the latest 2017 AOU checklists.\n\n■ Splits History. See what birds were renamed, split into different species or lumped together for 2014, 2015 and 2016.\n\n■ View all birds by head which makes identification easier.\n\n■ Back up and sync favorites and notes with iCloud and share with all your devices and your friends.\n\nPopular Features\n\n■ ‘Birds Around Me’ narrows the search list to just those birds centered on your GPS location, within a specified radius and a specific season. \n\n■ The patented Percevia™ intelligent search prevents you from making the wrong choice when searching for your bird.\n\n■ The only birding app that includes both Illustrations and Photos.\n\n■ Every species is shown perched and in flight and most show major seasonal, age and male/female variations.\n\n■ Identify 397 species of both native and rare Hawaiian and Palauan birds.\n\n■ Save multiple personal species lists and your sightings in Notes which can be backed up and synced in iCloud.\n\n■ Includes hundreds of carefully selected and edited sound recordings from the Xeno-Canto Community of bird song recordists. \n\n■ iBird’s icon-driven visual search engine, with 35 attributes, enables you to identify birds using shape, color, location, habitat, head pattern, flight pattern, bill shape, length and much more.\n\n■ Search by common name, Latin name and even band code.\n\n■ Comprehensive seasonal and migratory range maps include subspecies. \n\n■ The Conservation Status search attribute lets you filter birds by 6 threat levels including Least Concern, Near Threatened, Vulnerable, Endangered, Critically Endangered and Extinct in the Wild. The standard is maintained by Birdlife International and is called the IUCN Red List. \n\nWe invite all users to share their comments and ideas on our forum at www.whatbird.com/forum.

      "label": "A vital, easy-to-use tool for actors that will revolutionise how you rehearse. Based on the best-selling book.\n\nActions: The Actors’ Thesaurus is a vital tool for actors. It is perhaps the most widely used and admired book for use in rehearsals today – and is now available on your iPhone or iPad to help you find exactly the right action word within seconds.\n\nActors need actions. You cannot act moods. You need to be doing something with every line. You need an aim to achieve, and an action selected to help achieve that aim. ‘Actions’ are active verbs. In order to play a line truthfully, you need to discover the action that suits that particular situation and that particular line. That is where this app comes in…\n\nIt is a fully searchable, easy-to-navigate thesaurus of active verbs, that will help you refine your acting choice until you find the action you require to make each line come alive.\n\nFeatures include:\n\n·  A to Z search, and predictive search function\n·  Emotional groupings to help you pinpoint the action you require\n·  Bookmark, note-making and random word functions\n·  Share your actions on social media or by email\n·  Full instructions on how to use actioning in rehearsal, plus how to use the app\n\nFor actors at all levels and of all ages, Actions: The Actors’ Thesaurus will revolutionise how you rehearse. Once you’ve started using it, you’ll wonder how you ever managed without it.\n\n‘If you want to act, or act better, Actions will take you a long way on the journey to excellence’ Terry Johnson\n\n'Actioning ain't easy – but it's so useful' Zawe Ashton\n\nBased on the bestselling book Actions: The Actors’ Thesaurus by Marina Caldarone and Maggie Lloyd-Williams"

      "label": "SkySafari 6 Pro will revolutionize your astronomical viewing experience.  It has the largest database of any astronomy app, includes every solar system object ever discovered, offers unparalleled accuracy, flawless telescope control, Augmented Reality (AR) mode, and provides the very best experience under the stars when you depend on it. Discover why SkySafari 6 Pro is the #1 recommended astronomy app for serious amateur astronomers since 2009.\n\nHere's what's new in version 6:\n\n1) Complete support for iOS 13 and iPhone 11. We release regular updates.\n\n2) Clouds and Astronomy. Two words that rarely go together. SkySafari 6 Pro will (optionally) back up all of your observing data in our secure cloud storage and make it easily accessible to multiple devices as well as from our new web interface, LiveSky.com.\n\n3) We Have The Best Stars. Precise, modern and deep. We’ve updated our star catalog to use the latest and greatest, UCAC5 star catalog. If 25 million stars down to 15th magnitude isn’t enough for you, an easy in-app purchase gets you down to 16.5 magnitude and a whopping 100 million stars!\n\n4) We Have The Best Galaxies. The PGC catalog includes galaxies down to 18th magnitude. Want more galaxies? How about 2.6 million more? An in-app purchase gives you access to the largest galaxy database available for your device.\n\n5) Observers First. A redesign of our tools puts the active observer first. Quick access to features like your equipment, observing sites, lists, and observations make it easy and enjoyable to get out, observe, and record your observations. The observing sessions feature lets you collect your observations into groups that span a few hours, or a few nights.\n\n6) Graph It. The completely new graph tool will give a quick visual representation of an object’s altitude above the horizon. Essential for planning your night’s observations.\n\n7) Plan It. Make the most of your time under the stars. Our updated planner is a powerful tool that lets you create a list of targets for your observing session with filters like object types, specific time ranges, constellation, catalog, and more. Plan it and get more done.\n\n8) Say It. Ever just wanted to just yell at your device and tell it what to do!? SkySafari 6 adds basic voice control for a wide range of operations. Say “select Jupiter,” “search for Titan,” “center on Polaris” and SkySafari will do the work for you. Yelling optional. \n\n9) Tilt It. Every old astronomy app these days lets your tilt and pan your device to show different parts of the sky, but who else lets you control your telescope that way!? “Tilt to slew” is an optional mode allowing you to keep your eye in the eyepiece, and, using the accelerometers in your device, gently translate the movements of your hands into smooth telescope motion.\n\n10) Share It. SkySafari 6 is more than just a mobile app, it’s a new system to help organize and share your observing experiences. With a free signup, you can see and share your observing data from our web portal, LiveSky.com! Affordable premium memberships add online editing, so you can not only view, but edit your observations, add new observing sites, manage your equipment and more. Finally, (coming soon) you can view, edit and manage your settings files with SkySafari Web, our fully functional web version.\n\nIf you haven't used SkySafari 6 Pro before, here's what you can do with it:\n\n• Hold your device up, and SkySafari 6 Pro will find stars, constellations, planets, and more! The star chart updates automatically with your movements for the ultimate stargazing experience.\n\n• Simulate the night sky up to 10,000 years in the past or future! Animate meteor showers, conjunctions, eclipses, and other celestial events.\n\n• Control your telescope, log and plan your observations.\n\n• Night Vision.\n\n• Orbit Mode. Leave the Earth’s surface behind, and fly through our solar system.\n\n• Galaxy View shows the position of deep sky objects in our Milky Way!\n\n• Much more!"

It also allows you to measure the distance between any two points on a scanned or photographed image. The Stamp Analyser provides this information based on accurate measurement; no more guesswork. All you need to do is to provide a good scan or a good photograph of the stamp and the Stamp Analyser does the rest.\n\nOptionally, you can add the stamp Soundness and Eye Appeal components to obtain the final grade. The Soundness and Eye Appeal components are based on the PSE Grading Guide.\n\nThe Stamp Analyser user interface has been designed to be intuitive and simple. On the Mac, you simply drag and drop your stamp image into the Stamp Analyser. On the iPad and iPhone, you can either take a photo of the stamp or select it from the photo library.\n\nIOS 11 or higher required.\n\nMore detail on Rakium.com"

      "label": "This App is based upon the 1979 Book of Common Prayer (BCP - Episcopal Church) and the Revised Common Lectionary (RCL). The purpose of the App is to provide the complete Year A, B, and C Sunday Lectionary scriptures that are normally only listed by their passages. In the past, the reader would look up the passages in the Book of Common Prayer for the applicable Year and date. Next they would individually open their Bible to the passage to obtain the reading. \n\nBy having the readings in the app database saves the reader from having to look these scriptures up. The database and supporting algorithms also provide a perpetual yearly calendar for all Sunday readings (forever).\n\nTo select the Revised Common Lectionary (RCL), click the settings button in the bottom tab bar, then select RCL in the top right corner of the Settings display then click Save. You will need to close and reopen to app after changing the Lectionary setting. \n\nI hope you and your family enjoy this App as much as I have enjoyed creating it and using it for my own family."

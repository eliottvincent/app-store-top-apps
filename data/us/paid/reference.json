Quickly find rhymes, near rhymes (including slant rhymes), synonyms, antonyms, homophones, similar sounding words, words with the same consonant pattern, and other related words (generalizations, specializations, words appearing in the same context). Use Apple's local dictionaries or ours online if you are unsure of any meanings.\n\nYou get a database of over 150,000 words and phrases right at your fingertips. Find rhymes without an Internet connection, but if you are online, we'll connect you to RhymeZone.com for definitions and all the other great features you've come to love, ad-free! Or you can look it up on our sister site, OneLook.com, or even hear it pronounced with your device's built-in text-to-speech.\n\nThere's also a nifty \"Poet Maker\" feature, which lets you find words that match constraints on both rhyme and meaning at the same time. For example, suppose you want a word that rhymes with \"cat\" and means \"heavy\"; this feature will answer \"fat\" in no time. Or suppose you're looking for a rhyme of \"curious\" that means \"invalid\"; you'll get \"spurious\". You get the idea!\n\nSo whether you're aspiring to be the next Shakespeare, looking to put on the finishing touches of a love poem, bust out the next rap lyric, or just seeking some clever wordplay for your English assignment, give the app a try!"

The children of the promise would have forgotten their heritage and identity and all the history that they ought to have known.\n\nThey would now require some extensive hand-holding as they are taken from passage to passage, and the understanding of each line of scripture is ellucidated and taught to them precept by precept.\n\nIf you want to understand the bible, you will need to be guided by the precepts, which are the keys to unlocking the meanings and intents of its passages in context. Let scripture interpret scripture.\n\nSTART LEARNING PRECEPTS NOW!\n- Start by reading the verses and passages related to each precept;\n- Get the understanding of the precept by reading the cross-linked verses;\n- You begin to see the consistency in scripture when you realise that certain words and phrases maintain specific meaning in all the verses they appear in;\n- Connect the dots and you begin to see the bigger picture of what the bible is really revealing.\n\nMORE FEATURES WITH EACH UPDATE\n- Easy navigation for chapters and verses;\n- Quickly check up on precepts listed under a verse, and link to cross-linked verses;\n- Adjust font sizes for accessibility;\n- Use the contact form to send us messages and what you've discovered;\n- Join our mailing list and get updates about our occasional updates and learning aids;\n\nREDISCOVER THE CORRECT WAY TO UNDERSTAND SCRIPTURE\n- Build up entire teaching series using bible precepts to maintain true scriptural meanings and consistency in the understanding delivered.\n\nJoin us on social media and share the gospel to wake up the lost sheep!\nShare this app with friends and family and be part of their awakening."

      "label": "This app is a recreation of the Noah Webster 1828 two-volume dictionary. Its intrinsic value will not only be of great interest to those studying American heritage and Christian studies, but also to writers and those exploring poetry.\n\nNoah Websters 1828 American Dictionary contains the greatest number of Biblical definitions given in any reference volume. It is an invaluable resource written when American values and patriotism were based on Christian values.\n\nOf interest to poets and writers, The Noah Webster dictionary was used extensively by Emily Dickinson. We know that she made frequent and extensive use of Noah Webster's American Dictionary of the English Language in writing her poems, paying attention not only to the definitions but also to Webster's etymologies and his illustrative quotations.\n\nBeing able to see how definitions have evolved today is fascinating, and a great resource when studying.\n\nYou can easily search or browse the entire dictionary and add favourites to revisit later.\n\nApp design by professional app developer NASDA Studios."

In this way the Strong's Concordance provides an independent check against translations, and offers an opportunity for greater, and more technically accurate understanding of the Bible text.\n\nWant to see it in action before you buy? Try Strong's Concordance Lite which provides a 100% functional demo of Matthew and Genesis.\n\nThis program does not require internet access, everything you need is all stored on the iDevice.\n\nFeatures:\n* Search for English words, and lookup Greek/Hebrew dictionaries.\n* Proper concordance, listing how the word was translated in other bible verses.\n* Full King James Text is included\n* Click on any blue word for concordance text.\n* Night mode for those that like to read at night (White on black)\n* iPad support\n\nPlease note: This version is not an \"exhaustive\" concordance, and does skip smaller words such as \"and, or, the, a\" as well as some other words. Though we think you'll find it has most (if not all) the words you'll ever need.\n\nWe're open to suggestions for improvement in future versions. Send comments and suggestions to strongs at orionsys.org."

If you need to access Yoshon.com’s resources like the pdf of the Guide to Chodosh or other updates, it is all accessible to you from the app!\n\n——————\n\nOur lightning-fast UPC barcode scanner is the best feature of the whole app!  Simply tap on the Scan button and point your phone’s screen at a UPC barcode. It will take you to that exact product that is on our website. It totally eliminates misspellings and fat-fingering on phones that have smaller screens and keyboards. \n\nIf we have the info on our site, it will come up! -- It almost eliminates the need for manual searches, with the exception of items that we have not gotten a UPC for, or sometimes general items like certain baked goods that are bought in different quantities. Once scanned, the product entry will show  its date code or status, and if your package’s date is before the one shown on the app, you will know it is yoshon!\n\n——————\n\nYour very own customizable grocery Favorites List! For those who buy specific items repeatedly, this is a “must-have” feature! \nFrom the \"My Favorites\" (Favs button) screen, search for your product, and save it as a “Favorite”, by clicking on the small heart icon (found in the upper right corner of each product entry). Once this is done, it saves it instantly to your Favorites List!\n\nThe next time you want to go shopping for that item, go to your Favorites list by tapping on the “Favs” button at the bottom. It will bring up the “My Favorites” screen, where you can click on that product and bring it up immediately. It is that easy, and makes shopping for yoshon items a breeze!!\n\n——————\n\nTo contact us, choose text, phone, or WhatsApp chatting. The WhatsApp chat goes to the private texting.\n\nWith over 2,200 product entries (and that number is constantly growing), there are plenty of items to choose from that we have yoshon information on. We hope that you will find our exciting new app to be something you just can’t live without!\n\n---------"

      "label": "The Lost Person Behavior App is based upon the Search and Rescue (SAR) international gold standard reference tool on where to look for lost and missing persons. Every Public Safety Official needs to know where the missing person might be, what to ask, where to look, and what to do when minutes matter. The app was built around the field needs of Public Safety Officials.  No matter how remote the location, the app continues to function since no network connection is required, once installed.\n\nThis life-saving information is customized for 41 different subject categories. The categories are organized into a hierarchy of groups including external factors (abductions, aircraft), water incidents (boats and persons in the water), wheeled incidents (ATV, mountain bikes, vehicles, etc.), mental states (autism, dementia, despondent, intellectual disability, mental illness, substance intoxication), children (in five different age groups), and eighteen outdoor activities (hiker, hunter, climber, gatherer, skier, etc.).\n\nThe app guides the user in selecting the correct subject category by several means. The subject category wizard allows the user to select potential scenarios and then will suggest the best match for the subject category.  For example, if a child was riding his bicycle and was then known to be abducted, the user could select Child, Wheel/Motorized, and Abduction; the wizard would suggest using the abduction category. Alternately, the user can go straight to a subject category by using favorites, an alphabetical list, or the hierarchy list. Once the subject category is selected, the Lost Person Behavior App provides the user with: \n•\tbehavioral profiles\n•\ttactical briefings\n•\tspecific investigative questions\n•\tspatial and survival statistics\n•\tsuggestions for initial tasks (reflex tasking).\n\nThe all-new tactical briefings distill the statistics and profiles to the key points that every field searcher must know. The more extensive profile, full statistics, and suggested initial tasks assist even the seasoned search planner. The highly detailed questions for the investigation resulted from decades of SAR experience and thousands of missions.\n\nThe app even allows you to email a checklist of these critical tasks and interview questions so that you may print them out.  The email could also be used for providing remote support or documenting tasks that have been completed.\n\nDetermining where to look is one of the major functions of the search statistics, which are now provided in a graphical and tabular format.  The statistics from thousands of SAR missions allow the search planner to see where similar previous search subjects were found. The SAR statistics include:\n•\tDistance from the Initial Planning Point\n•\tElevation model (likelihood of going up, down, or staying at the same elevation)\n•\tMobility model (how long will the subject keep moving)\n•\tDispersion angle (given a direction of travel, how well does that predict subject’s location)\n•\tTrack Offset model (how far away from a feature such as a road or trail is subject found)\n•\tFind location (at what type of geographic feature was the subject found)\n•\tScenario (what caused the subject to become missing)\n•\tSurvivability overall (what is the overall chance of finding the subject alive or injured)\n•\tSurvivability rate (how does survivability rate change in 24-hour increments).\n\nThe Lost Person Behavior App can be easily customized to only show the statistical information you actually need. The user can customize for ecoregion, terrain, and urban incidents. The user can view the data in both metric and English units. Several additional helpful tools are built into the app. Contextual help is provided on every page with additional information boxes, which explain every element of the app on the page you need.  The information page provides information about the bike wheel model used to describe initial tactical deployment (reflex tasking), a glossary, help, and contact information."

      "label": "This application is for any gun owner! The purpose of this app is for the legal and conscientious concealed carry license holder to know where they cannot legally carry before getting there. A licensed permit holder or a resident of a constitutional carry state can usually legally carry their firearm in any location other than statutory \"no carry\" locations such as schools, gov. buildings, etc., and in businesses that are posted prohibiting firearms. This is a list of those Posted Anti-Gun businesses. \n\nThis #1-selling app of its kind (both on Apple App Store and other platforms) already includes over 19,000 current anti-gun locations and 17,000 pro-2a alternatives.\n\nFind hotels where you can’t carry before booking a trip to one. Find restaurants where you cannot carry before making dinner plans. Find stores to avoid before you step out the door. It is extremely inconvenient to not find out until you get to a location that they prohibit your second amendment rights. You have to either disarm in the parking lot (causing your vehicle to be a target for thieves) or go somewhere else at the last second. If you know beforehand, you can avoid the places that prohibit carry, or you can leave your firearm at home if you must attend. \n\nWe have a comprehensive list of \"Posted anti-gun\" locations collected in Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin. We have assembled smaller lists in  Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Idaho, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Utah, West Virginia, and Wyoming; provided by many great gun forums and sites with their permission. Since it is crowd-sourced by users like you, please help the list continue to grow!\n\nThe app also includes the option to add pro-gun alternatives that do not prohibit carry.  Search for pro-gun substitutes to the anti-gun businesses.  Easily add new ones to the list every time you experience firearm-friendly (or neutral) service.\n\nThis app includes the easy ability to take action.  Call or email a listed business to let them know your opinion!\n\nLaws regarding signage, and prohibited locations (no sign needed) vary by state. To understand your state’s specific laws, download \"CCW – 50 State Guide\" (http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id443321291). \n\nThis list is user-updated, and will continue to get better over time. But this relies on you! If you go to a place not on the list and they have a sign, please add it with a few clicks via the \"Add a Business\" button! If a place had taken down their sign, get it removed the same way! If you already have a list of anti-gun businesses in your area or state, send us an email. We would love to include any data you have collected, and give you credit for it! \n\nIf you experience any bugs or issues, please email (using the \"Feedback\" button) before leaving app feedback. \n\nDisclaimer: This application implies no warranty regarding the ability to legally carry in any locale or situation and does not constitute legal advice. Every user is responsible for knowing and abiding by the laws in his or her state. Some areas are illegal to carry by statute, even without signage. If unsure, contact local law enforcement or legal counsel. All information provided is simply the opinion of various users who added the location. By downloading and/or purchasing the application, you agree that you assume all risk and are responsible for confirming legality and abiding by all firearm laws. Please see full Disclaimer on Developer Website (below).\n\nThis application was built by Nantz Consulting & Workman Consulting LLC."

Passerines).\n● A basic personal species list that stores your sightings saved to the device* (ability to upload list coming soon)\n● A comprehensive help and introduction section to help you if you get stuck or don’t understand how a certain feature works.\n\n*Uninstalling/reinstalling the program will result in the loss of your list, it is recommended that you keep your own backup (master list) separate from the application.\n\nWe invite all users to share their comments and ideas on our forum at www.mydigitalearth.com \n\nNB.

      "label": "SkySafari 6 Plus goes beyond most basic astronomy apps by providing you with a full-featured space simulator with telescope control and Augmented Reality (AR) mode.\n\nNote that there is no discount upgrade path from SkySafari 6 Plus to SkySafari 6 Pro. Choose carefully!\n\nHere's what's new in version 6:\n\n1) Complete support for iOS 13 and iPhone 11. We got you covered and release regular updates.\n\n2) Clouds and Astronomy. Two words that rarely go together. Rewritten from the ground up, SkySafari 6 Plus will (optionally) back up all of your observing data in our secure cloud storage and make it easily accessible to multiple devices as well as from our new web interface, LiveSky.com.\n\n3) We Have The Best Stars. Precise, modern and deep. We’ve updated our star catalog to use the latest and greatest, UCAC5 star catalog.\n\n4) Observers First. A redesign of our tools puts the active observer first. Quick access to features like your equipment, observing sites, lists, and observations make it easy and enjoyable to get out, observe, and record your observations.\n\n5) Graph It. The completely new graph tool will give a quick visual representation of an object’s altitude above the horizon. Essential for planning your night’s observations.\n\n6) Plan It. Make the most of your time under the stars. Our updated planner is a powerful tool that lets you create a list of targets for your observing session with filters like object types, specific time ranges, constellation, catalog, and more. Plan it and get more done.\n\n7) Say It. Ever just wanted to just yell at your device and tell it what to do!? SkySafari 6 adds basic voice control for a wide range of operations. Say “select Jupiter,” “search for Titan,” “center on Polaris” and SkySafari will do the work for you. Yelling optional. \n\n8) Tilt It. Every old astronomy app these days lets your tilt and pan your device to show different parts of the sky, but who else lets you control your telescope that way!? “Tilt to slew” is an optional mode allowing you to keep your eye in the eyepiece, and, using the accelerometers in your device, gently translate the movements of your hands into smooth telescope motion.\n\n9) Share It. SkySafari 6 is more than just a mobile app, it’s a new system to help organize and share your observing experiences. With a free signup, you can see and share your observing data from our web portal, LiveSky.com! Affordable premium memberships add online editing, so you can not only view, but edit your observations, add new observing sites, manage your equipment and more. Finally, (coming soon) you can view, edit and manage your settings files with SkySafari Web, our fully functional web version.\n\nIf you haven't used SkySafari 6 Plus before, here's what you can do with it:\n\n• Hold your device up, and SkySafari 6 Plus will find stars, constellations, planets, and more!\n\n• Simulate the night sky up to 10,000 years in the past or future! Animate meteor showers, conjunctions, eclipses, and other celestial events.\n\n• Learn the history, mythology, and science of astronomy! Browse over 1500 object descriptions and astronomical images. Explore NASA space missions! Stay up-to-date with SkyWeek for all major sky events every day!\n\n• Control your telescope, log and plan your observations.\n\n• Night Vision  – Preserve your eyesight after dark.\n\n• Orbit Mode. Leave the Earth’s surface behind, and fly through our solar system.\n\n• Time Flow – Follow the motion of sky objects as days, months, and years are compressed into a few seconds.\n\n• Advanced Search – Find objects using properties other than their name.\n\n• Support for Apple Watch!\n\n• Tonight at a Glance: the Sun, Moon, Planets, ISS, and Iridium flares in one handy view!\n\n• Notifications when the ISS will pass overhead, when Iridium satellites flare, and more!\n\n• Much more!\n\nFor even more features, and a gigantic database aimed at the most dedicated amateur or professional astronomer, check out SkySafari 6 Pro!"

I've been using it all the time playing ALL TES games!\" - Demokratiya (Russia)\n\n\"Since I'm an alt-holic and spend tons of time just trying to come up with names, this app helps me out so much. I definitely recommend this for anyone who spends time trying to get lore appropriate names for their toons :D\" - Nicholas castillo (USA)\n\nNow is the time to find out just how using Name Generator for The Elder Scrolls Online may assist YOUR search for your ideal character name. Just select your preferred race and gender, then press \"Generate name\" and let the endless stream of lore-friendly names inspire you.\n\nThis name generator allows you to easily establish a distinctive, lore-friendly name to use in The Elder Scrolls Online®, the massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by ZeniMax Online Studios® and published by Bethesda Softworks®.\n\nName Generator for The Elder Scrolls Online invites you to taste all the rich and diverse flavours of Tamrielic names, combining more than 10.000 hand-picked male, female and surnames from all the playable races, i.e. Altmer (High Elf), Argonian, Bosmer (Wood Elf), Breton, Dunmer (Dark Elf; separately including names of both Dunmer and Velothi/Ashlander origin), Imperial, Khajiit, Nord, Orsimer (Orc), and Redguard, as well as including a modest number of Ayleid names as a small bonus for those who want inspiration for a name as a claimant of the true heirs to Imperial City. All generated names are, to a general extent, adhering to the lore of Tamriel and the Elder Scrolls® universe, but the names are generated for inspirational purposes primarily, and it's up to you to define the unique story of how your character acquired his/her name.\n\nNow, let the endless stream of lore-friendly names inspire you, allowing you to create a distinct, immersion-enhancing name you will be proud to bear in the realm of Tamriel!\n\nNote: While this name generator can supply both first and last names for all races, Redguards traditionally have only been called by their given name in general, and the Altmer, Argonians, Bosmer and Khajiit generally lost their tradition to bear surnames somewhere between 3E 405 and 3E 427. It is recommended to pay regard to these naming conventions when naming characters of the above races, however you are free to generate inspirational names of both options for any race.\n\nLegal disclaimer: This application is a fan's humble tribute to Tamriel's captivating lore and hopefully a useful tool for those who choose to blissfully dwell there, but it is not affiliated with or endorsed by neither the developer, ZeniMax Online Studios®, nor the publisher, Bethesda Softworks®, of The Elder Scrolls Online®. This name generator is solely intended to assist fans and subscribers of the MMORPG in choosing a name which accomodates their preferences, as well as stimulating a more lore-friendly world in-game."

Quickly find rhymes, near rhymes (including slant rhymes), synonyms, antonyms, homophones, similar sounding words, words with the same consonant pattern, and other related words (generalizations, specializations, words appearing in the same context). Use Apple's local dictionaries or ours online if you are unsure of any meanings.\n\nYou get a database of over 150,000 words and phrases right at your fingertips. Find rhymes without an Internet connection, but if you are online, we'll connect you to RhymeZone.com for definitions and all the other great features you've come to love, ad-free! Or you can look it up on our sister site, OneLook.com, or even hear it pronounced with your device's built-in text-to-speech.\n\nThere's also a nifty \"Poet Maker\" feature, which lets you find words that match constraints on both rhyme and meaning at the same time. For example, suppose you want a word that rhymes with \"cat\" and means \"heavy\"; this feature will answer \"fat\" in no time. Or suppose you're looking for a rhyme of \"curious\" that means \"invalid\"; you'll get \"spurious\". You get the idea!\n\nSo whether you're aspiring to be the next Shakespeare, looking to put on the finishing touches of a love poem, bust out the next rap lyric, or just seeking some clever wordplay for your English assignment, give the app a try!"

In this way the Strong's Concordance provides an independent check against translations, and offers an opportunity for greater, and more technically accurate understanding of the Bible text.\n\nWant to see it in action before you buy? Try Strong's Concordance Lite which provides a 100% functional demo of Matthew and Genesis.\n\nThis program does not require internet access, everything you need is all stored on the iDevice.\n\nFeatures:\n* Search for English words, and lookup Greek/Hebrew dictionaries.\n* Proper concordance, listing how the word was translated in other bible verses.\n* Full King James Text is included\n* Click on any blue word for concordance text.\n* Night mode for those that like to read at night (White on black)\n* iPad support\n\nPlease note: This version is not an \"exhaustive\" concordance, and does skip smaller words such as \"and, or, the, a\" as well as some other words. Though we think you'll find it has most (if not all) the words you'll ever need.\n\nWe're open to suggestions for improvement in future versions. Send comments and suggestions to strongs at orionsys.org."

It is an invaluable resource written when American values and patriotism were based on Christian values.\n\nOf interest to poets and writers, The Noah Webster dictionary was used extensively by Emily Dickinson. We know that she made frequent and extensive use of Noah Webster's American Dictionary of the English Language in writing her poems, paying attention not only to the definitions but also to Webster's etymologies and his illustrative quotations.\n\nBeing able to see how definitions have evolved today is fascinating, and a great resource when studying.\n\nYou can easily search or browse the entire dictionary and add favourites to revisit later.\n\nApp design by professional app developer NASDA Studios."

      "label": "This application is for any gun owner! The purpose of this app is for the legal and conscientious concealed carry license holder to know where they cannot legally carry before getting there. A licensed permit holder or a resident of a constitutional carry state can usually legally carry their firearm in any location other than statutory \"no carry\" locations such as schools, gov. buildings, etc., and in businesses that are posted prohibiting firearms. This is a list of those Posted Anti-Gun businesses. \n\nThis #1-selling app of its kind (both on Apple App Store and other platforms) already includes over 19,000 current anti-gun locations and 17,000 pro-2a alternatives.\n\nFind hotels where you can’t carry before booking a trip to one. Find restaurants where you cannot carry before making dinner plans. Find stores to avoid before you step out the door. It is extremely inconvenient to not find out until you get to a location that they prohibit your second amendment rights. You have to either disarm in the parking lot (causing your vehicle to be a target for thieves) or go somewhere else at the last second. If you know beforehand, you can avoid the places that prohibit carry, or you can leave your firearm at home if you must attend. \n\nWe have a comprehensive list of \"Posted anti-gun\" locations collected in Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin. We have assembled smaller lists in  Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Idaho, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Utah, West Virginia, and Wyoming; provided by many great gun forums and sites with their permission. Since it is crowd-sourced by users like you, please help the list continue to grow!\n\nThe app also includes the option to add pro-gun alternatives that do not prohibit carry.  Search for pro-gun substitutes to the anti-gun businesses.  Easily add new ones to the list every time you experience firearm-friendly (or neutral) service.\n\nThis app includes the easy ability to take action.  Call or email a listed business to let them know your opinion!\n\nLaws regarding signage, and prohibited locations (no sign needed) vary by state. To understand your state’s specific laws, download \"CCW – 50 State Guide\" (http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id443321291). \n\nThis list is user-updated, and will continue to get better over time. But this relies on you! If you go to a place not on the list and they have a sign, please add it with a few clicks via the \"Add a Business\" button! If a place had taken down their sign, get it removed the same way! If you already have a list of anti-gun businesses in your area or state, send us an email. We would love to include any data you have collected, and give you credit for it! \n\nIf you experience any bugs or issues, please email (using the \"Feedback\" button) before leaving app feedback. \n\nDisclaimer: This application implies no warranty regarding the ability to legally carry in any locale or situation and does not constitute legal advice. Every user is responsible for knowing and abiding by the laws in his or her state. Some areas are illegal to carry by statute, even without signage. If unsure, contact local law enforcement or legal counsel. All information provided is simply the opinion of various users who added the location. By downloading and/or purchasing the application, you agree that you assume all risk and are responsible for confirming legality and abiding by all firearm laws. Please see full Disclaimer on Developer Website (below).\n\nThis application was built by Nantz Consulting & Workman Consulting LLC."

Don't forget LAT/LON (in decimal), use periods as decimals, please.\n\nThe application accesses our Worldwide Repeater Directory and scanner directory for Amateur Radio (Ham Radio) but only stores information for repeaters within approximately 80 miles (125 km) from your location on your handheld at any one time, saving you room on your device and allowing distance calculation and mapping features to operate smoothly. It uses geolocation either via cell tower triangulation, GPS or manual location entry (so you can look up the repeaters you will use on vacation or business trips, etc.).\n\nIf anyone has lists of Amateur Radio repeaters from their countries we would love to incorporate that into our database.\n\nWorldwide IRLP and Echolink nodes.\n\n© ITWeRKS 2011"

No truth is more evident to my mind than that the Christian religion must be the basis of any government intended to secure the rights and privileges of a free people.\"\n\nNoah Webster, the Father of American Christian education, wrote the first American dictionary and established a system of rules to govern spelling, grammar, and reading. This master linguist understood the power of words, their definitions, and the need for precise word usage in communication to maintain independence. Webster used the Bible as the foundation for his definitions thus making the 1828 Dictionary a work that contains more Biblical definitions than any other reference work.\n\nThis app is an essential tool for students of all ages."

      "label": "Imagine sharing the same devotional with 1.5 million believers in more than 50 languages around the globe. The Moravian Daily Texts has been living this ecumenical dream for many years!\n\nFirst published in 1731 in Saxony, the Daily Texts grew out of a spiritual renewal of the Moravian Church (Unitas Fratrum) that dates back to August 13, 1727. Today, more than 280 years after its first publication, the Daily Texts continues its promise of “a daily message from God that is new every morning.” \n\nThe Moravian Daily Texts offers an inspirational connection to the Holy Scriptures every day. Each entry in this beloved daily devotional includes “watchwords”—Old and New Testament verses to accompany readers throughout the day—combined with heartfelt prayers written by Moravian Church pastors and members from across North America.\n\nEach day, the Daily Texts app offers these verses and prayers, along with links to the full Bible verses in context (note: web access is required for this feature). In addition, the Daily Texts app includes a plan that guides readers through the Psalms in one year and the Old and New Testaments in two years.\n\nFeatures in this app include:\n- Text-to-speech capability, allowing users to hear the Daily Texts read\n- Journaling capability to capture thoughts and insights on each day's Daily Texts\n- Search functions by word or Bible verse\n- Texts for 2017-2023\n- Indicators for favorite Daily Texts and Texts read\n- Notifications\n\nProduced by the Interprovincial Board of Communication of the Moravian Church in America, the texts in this app are contained in the North American printed versions of the Moravian Daily Texts 2023 (note: hymn texts available in the printed versions are not included in this app). The Daily Texts are shared in more than 50 languages around the world.\n\nFor more information about the Moravian Daily Texts, please visit www.moravian.org."

      "label": "The Lost Person Behavior App is based upon the Search and Rescue (SAR) international gold standard reference tool on where to look for lost and missing persons. Every Public Safety Official needs to know where the missing person might be, what to ask, where to look, and what to do when minutes matter. The app was built around the field needs of Public Safety Officials.  No matter how remote the location, the app continues to function since no network connection is required, once installed.\n\nThis life-saving information is customized for 41 different subject categories. The categories are organized into a hierarchy of groups including external factors (abductions, aircraft), water incidents (boats and persons in the water), wheeled incidents (ATV, mountain bikes, vehicles, etc.), mental states (autism, dementia, despondent, intellectual disability, mental illness, substance intoxication), children (in five different age groups), and eighteen outdoor activities (hiker, hunter, climber, gatherer, skier, etc.).\n\nThe app guides the user in selecting the correct subject category by several means. The subject category wizard allows the user to select potential scenarios and then will suggest the best match for the subject category.  For example, if a child was riding his bicycle and was then known to be abducted, the user could select Child, Wheel/Motorized, and Abduction; the wizard would suggest using the abduction category. Alternately, the user can go straight to a subject category by using favorites, an alphabetical list, or the hierarchy list. Once the subject category is selected, the Lost Person Behavior App provides the user with: \n•\tbehavioral profiles\n•\ttactical briefings\n•\tspecific investigative questions\n•\tspatial and survival statistics\n•\tsuggestions for initial tasks (reflex tasking).\n\nThe all-new tactical briefings distill the statistics and profiles to the key points that every field searcher must know. The more extensive profile, full statistics, and suggested initial tasks assist even the seasoned search planner. The highly detailed questions for the investigation resulted from decades of SAR experience and thousands of missions.\n\nThe app even allows you to email a checklist of these critical tasks and interview questions so that you may print them out.  The email could also be used for providing remote support or documenting tasks that have been completed.\n\nDetermining where to look is one of the major functions of the search statistics, which are now provided in a graphical and tabular format.  The statistics from thousands of SAR missions allow the search planner to see where similar previous search subjects were found. The SAR statistics include:\n•\tDistance from the Initial Planning Point\n•\tElevation model (likelihood of going up, down, or staying at the same elevation)\n•\tMobility model (how long will the subject keep moving)\n•\tDispersion angle (given a direction of travel, how well does that predict subject’s location)\n•\tTrack Offset model (how far away from a feature such as a road or trail is subject found)\n•\tFind location (at what type of geographic feature was the subject found)\n•\tScenario (what caused the subject to become missing)\n•\tSurvivability overall (what is the overall chance of finding the subject alive or injured)\n•\tSurvivability rate (how does survivability rate change in 24-hour increments).\n\nThe Lost Person Behavior App can be easily customized to only show the statistical information you actually need. The user can customize for ecoregion, terrain, and urban incidents. The user can view the data in both metric and English units. Several additional helpful tools are built into the app. Contextual help is provided on every page with additional information boxes, which explain every element of the app on the page you need.  The information page provides information about the bike wheel model used to describe initial tactical deployment (reflex tasking), a glossary, help, and contact information."

That is where this app comes in…\n\nIt is a fully searchable, easy-to-navigate thesaurus of active verbs, that will help you refine your acting choice until you find the action you require to make each line come alive.\n\nFeatures include:\n\n·  A to Z search, and predictive search function\n·  Emotional groupings to help you pinpoint the action you require\n·  Bookmark, note-making and random word functions\n·  Share your actions on social media or by email\n·  Full instructions on how to use actioning in rehearsal, plus how to use the app\n\nFor actors at all levels and of all ages, Actions: The Actors’ Thesaurus will revolutionise how you rehearse.

      "label": "Thank you to everyone who wrote me about the recent bug that cause the app to crash when using location services in iOS 10.  Version 3.5 should solve this problem! \n\nHistorical Markers displays the location and description of over 140,000 historic markers throughout North America.  Access detailed plaque descriptions, photos, and links to online repositories of historical information.  The app allows you to display markers near your current position or browse the entire marker catalog right on your device. Historical Markers contains thousands of markers with full plaque text from the Historical Marker Database (HMDB.org) as well as detailed place information for the entire U.S. National Registry of Historic Places.  \n\nHistorical Markers is a perfect application for anyone interested in learning about the history around them, whether on travel or closer to home. \n\nFeatures Include:\n- Over 71,000 markers from the Historical Marker Database\n- Over 76,000 markers from the U.S. National Registry of Historic Places\n- Images of markers and surrounding areas\n- GPS utility to display markers around your current location\n- Text to speech engine to allow voice dictation of marker descriptions while on the road\n- Area search for user specified address or city \n- Comprehensive search utility to sort through markers\n- Email marker information without leaving the app\n- The ability to create a custom list of favorite markers\n- Viewing history to help distinguish previously viewed markers\n- Share favorited markers via Facebook, Twitter, and other social media platforms\n- Offline database, allowing the app to work without an active data connection.\n- User selectable search radius (for improved performance on older devices)\n- Multithreading support for improved performance \n- Native iPad support\n\nEmail us: support@kocevski.com\nBecome a fan: http://www.facebook.com/historicalmarkersapp\nFollow us: https://twitter.com/MarkersApp\n\nI've implemented the ability to favorite individual markers and a feature to help distinguish previously viewed markers, as suggested in the reviews. If you would like to share more suggestions on how to improve the app, or if you encounter a bug, please feel free to contact me at support@kocevski.com or tweet ideas and/or comments to @MarkersApp.  \n\nAlso, please note that Historical Markers aggregates data from the Historical Marker Database and the U.S. National Registry of Historic Places.  If a local marker is not in either of these databases, it will not appear in the app.  If you would like to add a local marker to the Historical Marker Database, please visit http://www.hmdb.org.  The ability to upload marker information and pictures directly from your iOS device is coming in a future release!"

As a writer, you can also use it to look up words you already know. Or think you do! And you should, because this is Mr. Webster's actual and original dictionary. The real deal.\n\nThe magic is in the definitions for commonplace words. Just take a look at the screenshots! This is good stuff. It will delight and amuse. It may even kindle your imagination.\n\nThe author's personality shines through in colorful prose that's packed with classic examples of usage.\n\nAnd! \n\nRemember paging through a big hardcover dictionary looking for a word only to get sidetracked exploring other words you'd stumble across? \n\nOh-hoh! If I may bend your ear a moment longer...\n\nThe usual way to do search is to show only results that match what has been typed so far. And normally that's perfect: don't show you anything you don't need to see, right? \n\nBut if I did it that way, how can you get sidetracked?\n\nSo I went a different direction. All of the words are in a giant list. You can scroll it or jump to a letter. And as you search, it scrolls to the first match. It's fast and you can find what you want quickly, but it still leaves room for serendipity.\n\nGet it and get writing!"

Created from electronic files directly obtained from the Federal MUTCD team, the app is redefining how people interact with it!  Carry the manual with you everywhere, and find things immediately.  It is the quickest version of the MUTCD ever created!  Perfect for the civil engineer, contractor, or public works employee in the field.  It includes a custom designed interface with features never implemented before.  Features include:\n\n* Drill-down tables to find text, individual signs, figures and tables. The entire manual is in the app. Hyperlinks are provided in text to all corresponding figures and tables.  It has never been easier!\n\n* Text based search for Chapters, Sections, Signs, Tables and Figure titles.  Find all traffic signs by keyword or MUTCD code. For example, type in “Truck” for the signs tab, and see all signs with “Truck” in the title. Type in “R1-1”, and it shows the stop sign with touch based access to the corresponding section.\n\n* The sign tab includes a copyrighted, sign index with high-resolution graphics that is superior to all others!  Federal MUTCD signs are shown that allow one to touch the sign to reveal the relevant section.  You can visually search by sign type or show all MUTCD signs in the same drill-down table.  Over 800+ signs are available!\n\nA demonstration of the above features is available on YouTube at\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykH88PYkaAI\n\nThe MUTCD is in the initial stages of evolving to something much more than a simple PDF.  See the first stage of this evolution today!\n\nIt would be appreciated if you could rate the MUTCD app after using it.  All comments are appreciated."

Once you enter your oxygen supply and a flow rate, your minutes of usable oxygen will be generated.\n\nOxygen Calculation Tool makes it easy to add and delete up to 10 cylinders for both the portable and onboard supply. The user also has the flexibility to enter the flow rate as a free flow setting or from ventilation settings, calculated from the minute ventilation and the FiO2 settings. Optionally, user can also enter ventilator-specific bias flow, if needed. \n\nOxygen Calculation Tool also has a countdown feature. This can be used to time your O2 use with your chosen settings. Using the countdown will update the settings automatically. \n\nThe drip rate calculator can be used to assist you with med math. Enter the supply and dose information and the calculator will determine the rate in ml/hr.\n\nOxygen Calculation Tool contains a reference page, where the math calculation used in this app is outlined, along with a list of oxygen cylinders and associated conversion factors. If you don't see a cylinder size that you need, use the feedback feature found in the settings to let me know and I will try to add it.\n\nThis app is also dark mode compatible. \n\nCalculations are rounded down to the nearest whole minute.\n\n***Please note, this app does NOT subtract 200 psi from initial input to account for residual O2. Some formulas may call for this. If this is desired by users, you can subtract 200 psi from your pressure prior to input."

With all of the Rosary prayers from the official Vatican website inside, and the easy to use controls, you can view each daily prayer in one of four display styles. Adjust the font size to accommodate your visual preference.\n\nAs you make your way through the daily prayers, inspirational background music (choose either In His Time or Ave Maria) puts you in the right frame of mind for meditation. Each mystery is depicted in living color with beautiful pictures, or, if you prefer, you can add pictures from your personal photo album as well. This gorgeous art work is accompanied by Bible passages to help you reflect more deeply on each event. However, if you have a scripture which is a personal favorite, you can add your own text. \n\nMake your Holy Rosary Deluxe more personal by changing the beads to the color of your choice. Also you are able to choose how to progress through the prayer beads. Touch the current bead, and it will highlight and enlarge for prayer, or tap the arrow to move to the next bead. Each prayer bead is marked with a number so you can easily monitor your progress through the Rosary. \n\nThis app even remembers where you stopped during your last prayer and resumes where you left off when you return. If you accidentally skip ahead, you can easily go back to the proper bead to finish your prayer. When you're praying the new Novena feature, you can turn the Divine Mercy Chaplet on or off. The choice is yours.\n\nHoly Rosary Deluxe is the most versatile prayer app on the market, today. Everything you need is in one convenient place, so you can pray the Rosary where and when you choose.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n- Choose from four different display styles to pray the Holy Rosary and the Chaplet.\n- Each mystery has an image that helps to reflection of his events.

If you need to access Yoshon.com’s resources like the pdf of the Guide to Chodosh or other updates, it is all accessible to you from the app!\n\n——————\n\nOur lightning-fast UPC barcode scanner is the best feature of the whole app!  Simply tap on the Scan button and point your phone’s screen at a UPC barcode. It will take you to that exact product that is on our website. It totally eliminates misspellings and fat-fingering on phones that have smaller screens and keyboards. \n\nIf we have the info on our site, it will come up! -- It almost eliminates the need for manual searches, with the exception of items that we have not gotten a UPC for, or sometimes general items like certain baked goods that are bought in different quantities. Once scanned, the product entry will show  its date code or status, and if your package’s date is before the one shown on the app, you will know it is yoshon!\n\n——————\n\nYour very own customizable grocery Favorites List! For those who buy specific items repeatedly, this is a “must-have” feature! \nFrom the \"My Favorites\" (Favs button) screen, search for your product, and save it as a “Favorite”, by clicking on the small heart icon (found in the upper right corner of each product entry). Once this is done, it saves it instantly to your Favorites List!\n\nThe next time you want to go shopping for that item, go to your Favorites list by tapping on the “Favs” button at the bottom. It will bring up the “My Favorites” screen, where you can click on that product and bring it up immediately. It is that easy, and makes shopping for yoshon items a breeze!!\n\n——————\n\nTo contact us, choose text, phone, or WhatsApp chatting. The WhatsApp chat goes to the private texting.\n\nWith over 2,200 product entries (and that number is constantly growing), there are plenty of items to choose from that we have yoshon information on. We hope that you will find our exciting new app to be something you just can’t live without!\n\n---------"

The SDA Church Manual is very useful to all SDA Church Members and Leaders and other people who want to know more about Jesus and His Church the Seventh Day Adventist Church.\n\nFeatures :\n\n-\tFriendly interface\n-\tSearch any key word through the whole book\n- Support many languages : English, French, Spanish\n-\tZoom\n-\tWork offline\n-\tSelect the text to share it with your friends through e-mail, WhatsApp, Facebook\n-\tMore features to come with updates\n\n\nWhy does the Seventh-day Adventist Church have a Church Manual? God is a God of order as evidenced in His works of creation and redemption. Consequently, order belongs to the essence of His church. Order is achieved through principles and regulations that guide the Church in its internal operations and in fulfillmenting its mission to the world. In order for it to be a successful ecclesiastical organization at the service of the Lord and humanity, it needs order, rule, and discipline. Scripture affirms that “all things be done decently and in order” (1 Cor. 14:40)."

Search for answers in HSVG, a massive & constantly growing database of equine health info – conveniently available to you “horse side.” \n\nHSVG was created by Doug Thal DVM DABVP, a lifelong horseman & veterinarian that has practiced exclusively equine veterinary medicine for over 20 years & is board certified in equine practice.  \n\nHSVG provides helpful information about equine health from the moment you notice a problem with your horse - My Observation.  It contains practical advice, suggested skills, and questions to discuss with your vet.\n\nHSVG is of value in an emergency and non-emergency, and it helps you distinguish between the two. HSVG also contains dozens of high quality instructional videos, and other media designed to enable you to become an active participant in ensuring your horse’s good health.  \n\nHowever, HSVG is not structured as a simple decision tree that takes you down a singular path based on your input. It is not a substitute for your local equine veterinarian. It does not, and cannot, anticipate and address all of the subtle variations and unique circumstances associated with your horse’s health. That is your veterinarian's job.\n__________________________\n\n- Make better decisions about your horse’s health.\n- Increase the quality of communication between you and your vet.\n- Follow a logical thought process for addressing any equine heath care problem.\n- Utilize a quality alternative to Dr. Google.\n\nOk – so what is Horse Side Vet Guide exactly? \n\nHSVG is a custom-built relational database of equine health information that contains concise information about common problems to rare diseases.  Records are contained in 1 of 9 categories:\n\n- My Observations\n- Vet Diagnostics\n- Vet Diagnoses\n- Vet Treatments\n- My Skills\n- My Supplies\n- Terms & Topics\n- Media\n- Outside Resources\n\nThese records are extensively interlinked, providing a uniquely contextualized approach to any equine health issue. \n\nWe continuously add and update the records in HSVG. We have placed great emphasis on completing the MY OBSERVATIONS records first. You can find \"full access\" records with a keyword search, in the alphabetical browse lists, and hyperlinked inside other records. Incomplete (or \"partial access\") records are listed inside full access records, with no hyperlink. Many other records are hidden from view, and will be available later. After we complete a partial or hidden record we change it to \"full access\" and it becomes immediately available to you after the app has been synchronized to your mobile device. \n\nPlease see our website www.horsesidevetguide.com for more information about this application."

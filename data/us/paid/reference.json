      "label": "This application is for any gun owner! The purpose of this app is for the legal and conscientious concealed carry license holder to know where they cannot legally carry before getting there. A licensed permit holder or a resident of a constitutional carry state can usually legally carry their firearm in any location other than statutory \"no carry\" locations such as schools, gov. buildings, etc., and in businesses that are posted prohibiting firearms. This is a list of those Posted Anti-Gun businesses. \n\nThis #1-selling app of its kind (both on Apple App Store and other platforms) already includes over 19,000 current anti-gun locations and 17,000 pro-2a alternatives.\n\nFind hotels where you can’t carry before booking a trip to one. Find restaurants where you cannot carry before making dinner plans. Find stores to avoid before you step out the door. It is extremely inconvenient to not find out until you get to a location that they prohibit your second amendment rights. You have to either disarm in the parking lot (causing your vehicle to be a target for thieves) or go somewhere else at the last second. If you know beforehand, you can avoid the places that prohibit carry, or you can leave your firearm at home if you must attend. \n\nWe have a comprehensive list of \"Posted anti-gun\" locations collected in Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin. We have assembled smaller lists in  Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Idaho, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Utah, West Virginia, and Wyoming; provided by many great gun forums and sites with their permission. Since it is crowd-sourced by users like you, please help the list continue to grow!\n\nThe app also includes the option to add pro-gun alternatives that do not prohibit carry.  Search for pro-gun substitutes to the anti-gun businesses.  Easily add new ones to the list every time you experience firearm-friendly (or neutral) service.\n\nThis app includes the easy ability to take action.  Call or email a listed business to let them know your opinion!\n\nLaws regarding signage, and prohibited locations (no sign needed) vary by state. To understand your state’s specific laws, download \"CCW – 50 State Guide\" (http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id443321291). \n\nThis list is user-updated, and will continue to get better over time. But this relies on you! If you go to a place not on the list and they have a sign, please add it with a few clicks via the \"Add a Business\" button! If a place had taken down their sign, get it removed the same way! If you already have a list of anti-gun businesses in your area or state, send us an email. We would love to include any data you have collected, and give you credit for it! \n\nIf you experience any bugs or issues, please email (using the \"Feedback\" button) before leaving app feedback. \n\nDisclaimer: This application implies no warranty regarding the ability to legally carry in any locale or situation and does not constitute legal advice. Every user is responsible for knowing and abiding by the laws in his or her state. Some areas are illegal to carry by statute, even without signage. If unsure, contact local law enforcement or legal counsel. All information provided is simply the opinion of various users who added the location. By downloading and/or purchasing the application, you agree that you assume all risk and are responsible for confirming legality and abiding by all firearm laws. Please see full Disclaimer on Developer Website (below).\n\nThis application was built by Nantz Consulting & Workman Consulting LLC."

Quickly find rhymes, near rhymes (including slant rhymes), synonyms, antonyms, homophones, similar sounding words, words with the same consonant pattern, and other related words (generalizations, specializations, words appearing in the same context). Use Apple's local dictionaries or ours online if you are unsure of any meanings.\n\nYou get a database of over 150,000 words and phrases right at your fingertips. Find rhymes without an Internet connection, but if you are online, we'll connect you to RhymeZone.com for definitions and all the other great features you've come to love, ad-free! Or you can look it up on our sister site, OneLook.com, or even hear it pronounced with your device's built-in text-to-speech.\n\nThere's also a nifty \"Poet Maker\" feature, which lets you find words that match constraints on both rhyme and meaning at the same time. For example, suppose you want a word that rhymes with \"cat\" and means \"heavy\"; this feature will answer \"fat\" in no time. Or suppose you're looking for a rhyme of \"curious\" that means \"invalid\"; you'll get \"spurious\". You get the idea!\n\nSo whether you're aspiring to be the next Shakespeare, looking to put on the finishing touches of a love poem, bust out the next rap lyric, or just seeking some clever wordplay for your English assignment, give the app a try!"

It is an invaluable resource written when American values and patriotism were based on Christian values.\n\nOf interest to poets and writers, The Noah Webster dictionary was used extensively by Emily Dickinson. We know that she made frequent and extensive use of Noah Webster's American Dictionary of the English Language in writing her poems, paying attention not only to the definitions but also to Webster's etymologies and his illustrative quotations.\n\nBeing able to see how definitions have evolved today is fascinating, and a great resource when studying.\n\nYou can easily search or browse the entire dictionary and add favourites to revisit later.\n\nApp design by professional app developer NASDA Studios."

Search for answers in HSVG, a massive & constantly growing database of equine health info – conveniently available to you “horse side.” \n\nHSVG was created by Doug Thal DVM DABVP, a lifelong horseman & veterinarian that has practiced exclusively equine veterinary medicine for over 20 years & is board certified in equine practice.  \n\nHSVG provides helpful information about equine health from the moment you notice a problem with your horse - My Observation.  It contains practical advice, suggested skills, and questions to discuss with your vet.\n\nHSVG is of value in an emergency and non-emergency, and it helps you distinguish between the two. HSVG also contains dozens of high quality instructional videos, and other media designed to enable you to become an active participant in ensuring your horse’s good health.  \n\nHowever, HSVG is not structured as a simple decision tree that takes you down a singular path based on your input. It is not a substitute for your local equine veterinarian. It does not, and cannot, anticipate and address all of the subtle variations and unique circumstances associated with your horse’s health. That is your veterinarian's job.\n__________________________\n\n- Make better decisions about your horse’s health.\n- Increase the quality of communication between you and your vet.\n- Follow a logical thought process for addressing any equine heath care problem.\n- Utilize a quality alternative to Dr. Google.\n\nOk – so what is Horse Side Vet Guide exactly? \n\nHSVG is a custom-built relational database of equine health information that contains concise information about common problems to rare diseases.  Records are contained in 1 of 9 categories:\n\n- My Observations\n- Vet Diagnostics\n- Vet Diagnoses\n- Vet Treatments\n- My Skills\n- My Supplies\n- Terms & Topics\n- Media\n- Outside Resources\n\nThese records are extensively interlinked, providing a uniquely contextualized approach to any equine health issue. \n\nWe continuously add and update the records in HSVG. We have placed great emphasis on completing the MY OBSERVATIONS records first. You can find \"full access\" records with a keyword search, in the alphabetical browse lists, and hyperlinked inside other records. Incomplete (or \"partial access\") records are listed inside full access records, with no hyperlink. Many other records are hidden from view, and will be available later. After we complete a partial or hidden record we change it to \"full access\" and it becomes immediately available to you after the app has been synchronized to your mobile device. \n\nPlease see our website www.horsesidevetguide.com for more information about this application."

It allows sorting by distance or by Trustee callsign as well as filtering by band and radius in miles or kilometers.\n\nNOW RFinder Routing is integrated with RT Systems radio programmers! Your subscription bought here by installing this app gives you access in RT...just make sure RT is updated to the latest version by pressing Help-Update. Click File-External Data->RFinder Web Search and click Route! Easy as pie to program your radio now for a trip you are taking with just a few easy clicks...check out the tutorial video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaeRzcnNNdQ\n\nNOW INCLUDES SOCIAL FUNCTIONS!!!! In the repeater detail screen, click the Check In button. All users will see that you are on that machine! This can be used to find your friends or a machine with a user on it. In the settings bundle app/RFinder you can turn on APRS posting. This posts your current position with the repeater you are checked into. You can also let your friends on Facebook® know what repeater you are on as well as your Twitter® followers, when checking in.\n\nNOW INTEGRATED WITH THE EchoLink APP!!\nFrom the repeater detail screen, any repeater that has an Echolink node attached just touch the number and if you have the EchoLink app installed it will launch to that node automatically for you.\n\nOur repeater locator database is growing daily.\nAccess to the Directory is included for one year then it will be an annual subscription for $9.99, and your subscription works for all platforms.... Each purchase of a new platform advances your annual to a year from that new purchase date. Sub\n\nIf we do not have your repeaters listed...please do not refund or give us a bad rating...add repeaters at http://add.rfinder.net or request an add or update from the app.. Don't forget LAT/LON (in decimal), use periods as decimals, please.\n\nThe application accesses our Worldwide Repeater Directory and scanner directory for Amateur Radio (Ham Radio) but only stores information for repeaters within approximately 80 miles (125 km) from your location on your handheld at any one time, saving you room on your device and allowing distance calculation and mapping features to operate smoothly. It uses geolocation either via cell tower triangulation, GPS or manual location entry (so you can look up the repeaters you will use on vacation or business trips, etc.).\n\nIf anyone has lists of Amateur Radio repeaters from their countries we would love to incorporate that into our database.\n\nWorldwide IRLP and Echolink nodes.\n\n© ITWeRKS 2011"

Don’t postpone joy. Discover why SkySafari is the #1 recommended astronomy app for serious amateur astronomers since 2009.\n\nHere's what’s new in version 7:\n\n+ Complete support for iOS 15 and iPhone 13. Version 7 brings a new and immersive stargazing experience.\n\n+ Events Finder - go to the new Events section to unlock a powerful search engine that finds astronomical events visible tonight and far into the future.

No truth is more evident to my mind than that the Christian religion must be the basis of any government intended to secure the rights and privileges of a free people.\"\n\nNoah Webster, the Father of American Christian education, wrote the first American dictionary and established a system of rules to govern spelling, grammar, and reading. This master linguist understood the power of words, their definitions, and the need for precise word usage in communication to maintain independence. Webster used the Bible as the foundation for his definitions thus making the 1828 Dictionary a work that contains more Biblical definitions than any other reference work.\n\nThis app is an essential tool for students of all ages."

      "label": "Strong's Concordance, is a concordance of the King James Bible (KJV) that was constructed under the direction of Dr. James Strong (1822–1894) and first published in 1890.\n\nA concordance lets the reader directly compare how the same word may be used else where in the Bible. In this way the Strong's Concordance provides an independent check against translations, and offers an opportunity for greater, and more technically accurate understanding of the Bible text.\n\nWant to see it in action before you buy? Try Strong's Concordance Lite which provides a 100% functional demo of Matthew and Genesis.\n\nThis program does not require internet access, everything you need is all stored on the iDevice.\n\nFeatures:\n* Search for English words, and lookup Greek/Hebrew dictionaries.\n* Proper concordance, listing how the word was translated in other bible verses.\n* Full King James Text is included\n* Click on any blue word for concordance text.\n* Night mode for those that like to read at night (White on black)\n* iPad support\n\nPlease note: This version is not an \"exhaustive\" concordance, and does skip smaller words such as \"and, or, the, a\" as well as some other words. Though we think you'll find it has most (if not all) the words you'll ever need.\n\nWe're open to suggestions for improvement in future versions. Send comments and suggestions to strongs at orionsys.org."

The children of the promise would have forgotten their heritage and identity and all the history that they ought to have known.\n\nThey would now require some extensive hand-holding as they are taken from passage to passage, and the understanding of each line of scripture is ellucidated and taught to them precept by precept.\n\nIf you want to understand the bible, you will need to be guided by the precepts, which are the keys to unlocking the meanings and intents of its passages in context. Let scripture interpret scripture.\n\nSTART LEARNING PRECEPTS NOW!\n- Start by reading the verses and passages related to each precept;\n- Get the understanding of the precept by reading the cross-linked verses;\n- You begin to see the consistency in scripture when you realise that certain words and phrases maintain specific meaning in all the verses they appear in;\n- Connect the dots and you begin to see the bigger picture of what the bible is really revealing.\n\nMORE FEATURES WITH EACH UPDATE\n- Easy navigation for chapters and verses;\n- Quickly check up on precepts listed under a verse, and link to cross-linked verses;\n- Adjust font sizes for accessibility;\n- Use the contact form to send us messages and what you've discovered;\n- Join our mailing list and get updates about our occasional updates and learning aids;\n\nREDISCOVER THE CORRECT WAY TO UNDERSTAND SCRIPTURE\n- Build up entire teaching series using bible precepts to maintain true scriptural meanings and consistency in the understanding delivered.\n\nJoin us on social media and share the gospel to wake up the lost sheep!\nShare this app with friends and family and be part of their awakening."

It also includes a little memory game, and a mini course designer.\n\nIf you like the app, please take time to give it a positive review. A lot of time and energy is spent in the creation of an application like this, it is always nice to read some encouraging words. \n\nDo you have an idea that you would like to see in the app?

      "label": "Ready for exotic birds? iBird Hawaii and Palau is the only 100% complete app guide to birds of the Hawaiian Islands as well as the environmentally sensitive island nation of Palau. The app, which contains 228 species of Hawaiian birds and 169 species of Palauan birds offers all the features that contribute to making iBird the most popular birding app in the world. Like our top of the line iBird Ultimate app, iBird Hawaii and Palau offers the popular Birds Around Me (BAM) GPS feature as well as the Percevia™ Smart Search feature.  \n\nMore Details of What’s New: bit.ly/ibird-whatsnew\n\nIn 2008 iBird broke new ground as it turned the iPhone into a field guide app that identifies birds and plays their songs. Featured in Apple’s television commercials, it started a revolution that made iBird the most respected birding app in the world. \n\n** NOTE If you would like to try out iBird at no expense, check the newly released iBird LITE Free Guide to Birds of North America. It contains all the features of paid iBird Ultimate, but includes just 50 species. And it’s completely FREE. **\n\nWhether you are an experienced birder or a beginner, iBird Hawaii and Palau is the most authoritative guide to these exotic birds. \n\nFeatures\n\n■ Separate databases for Hawaii and Palau allow doing independent searching and identification as well as separate species accounts and song libraries. \n\n■ Birds Around Me (BAM) narrows the species being searched to just those found at your GPS location, within a radius and season you specify. \n\n■ Percevia™ intelligent search is a patented algorithm that guarantees you will only choose search attributes that narrow the matched list of birds. \n\n■ iBird now takes advantage of the high-resolution retina displays of the iPhone and iPad so the screen shows more information than ever.\n\n■ Contains the latest 2017 AOU checklists.\n\n■ Splits History. See what birds were renamed, split into different species or lumped together for 2014, 2015 and 2016.\n\n■ View all birds by head which makes identification easier.\n\n■ Back up and sync favorites and notes with iCloud and share with all your devices and your friends.\n\nPopular Features\n\n■ ‘Birds Around Me’ narrows the search list to just those birds centered on your GPS location, within a specified radius and a specific season. \n\n■ The patented Percevia™ intelligent search prevents you from making the wrong choice when searching for your bird.\n\n■ The only birding app that includes both Illustrations and Photos.\n\n■ Every species is shown perched and in flight and most show major seasonal, age and male/female variations.\n\n■ Identify 397 species of both native and rare Hawaiian and Palauan birds.\n\n■ Save multiple personal species lists and your sightings in Notes which can be backed up and synced in iCloud.\n\n■ Includes hundreds of carefully selected and edited sound recordings from the Xeno-Canto Community of bird song recordists. \n\n■ iBird’s icon-driven visual search engine, with 35 attributes, enables you to identify birds using shape, color, location, habitat, head pattern, flight pattern, bill shape, length and much more.\n\n■ Search by common name, Latin name and even band code.\n\n■ Comprehensive seasonal and migratory range maps include subspecies. \n\n■ The Conservation Status search attribute lets you filter birds by 6 threat levels including Least Concern, Near Threatened, Vulnerable, Endangered, Critically Endangered and Extinct in the Wild. The standard is maintained by Birdlife International and is called the IUCN Red List. \n\nWe invite all users to share their comments and ideas on our forum at www.whatbird.com/forum.

      "label": "SkySafari 6 Plus goes beyond most basic astronomy apps by providing you with a full-featured space simulator with telescope control and Augmented Reality (AR) mode.\n\nNote that there is no discount upgrade path from SkySafari 6 Plus to SkySafari 6 Pro. Choose carefully!\n\nHere's what's new in version 6:\n\n1) Complete support for iOS 13 and iPhone 11. We got you covered and release regular updates.\n\n2) Clouds and Astronomy. Two words that rarely go together. Rewritten from the ground up, SkySafari 6 Plus will (optionally) back up all of your observing data in our secure cloud storage and make it easily accessible to multiple devices as well as from our new web interface, LiveSky.com.\n\n3) We Have The Best Stars. Precise, modern and deep. We’ve updated our star catalog to use the latest and greatest, UCAC5 star catalog.\n\n4) Observers First. A redesign of our tools puts the active observer first. Quick access to features like your equipment, observing sites, lists, and observations make it easy and enjoyable to get out, observe, and record your observations.\n\n5) Graph It. The completely new graph tool will give a quick visual representation of an object’s altitude above the horizon. Essential for planning your night’s observations.\n\n6) Plan It. Make the most of your time under the stars. Our updated planner is a powerful tool that lets you create a list of targets for your observing session with filters like object types, specific time ranges, constellation, catalog, and more. Plan it and get more done.\n\n7) Say It. Ever just wanted to just yell at your device and tell it what to do!? SkySafari 6 adds basic voice control for a wide range of operations. Say “select Jupiter,” “search for Titan,” “center on Polaris” and SkySafari will do the work for you. Yelling optional. \n\n8) Tilt It. Every old astronomy app these days lets your tilt and pan your device to show different parts of the sky, but who else lets you control your telescope that way!? “Tilt to slew” is an optional mode allowing you to keep your eye in the eyepiece, and, using the accelerometers in your device, gently translate the movements of your hands into smooth telescope motion.\n\n9) Share It. SkySafari 6 is more than just a mobile app, it’s a new system to help organize and share your observing experiences. With a free signup, you can see and share your observing data from our web portal, LiveSky.com! Affordable premium memberships add online editing, so you can not only view, but edit your observations, add new observing sites, manage your equipment and more. Finally, (coming soon) you can view, edit and manage your settings files with SkySafari Web, our fully functional web version.\n\nIf you haven't used SkySafari 6 Plus before, here's what you can do with it:\n\n• Hold your device up, and SkySafari 6 Plus will find stars, constellations, planets, and more!\n\n• Simulate the night sky up to 10,000 years in the past or future! Animate meteor showers, conjunctions, eclipses, and other celestial events.\n\n• Learn the history, mythology, and science of astronomy! Browse over 1500 object descriptions and astronomical images. Explore NASA space missions! Stay up-to-date with SkyWeek for all major sky events every day!\n\n• Control your telescope, log and plan your observations.\n\n• Night Vision  – Preserve your eyesight after dark.\n\n• Orbit Mode. Leave the Earth’s surface behind, and fly through our solar system.\n\n• Time Flow – Follow the motion of sky objects as days, months, and years are compressed into a few seconds.\n\n• Advanced Search – Find objects using properties other than their name.\n\n• Support for Apple Watch!\n\n• Tonight at a Glance: the Sun, Moon, Planets, ISS, and Iridium flares in one handy view!\n\n• Notifications when the ISS will pass overhead, when Iridium satellites flare, and more!\n\n• Much more!\n\nFor even more features, and a gigantic database aimed at the most dedicated amateur or professional astronomer, check out SkySafari 6 Pro!"

It is perhaps the most widely used and admired book for use in rehearsals today – and is now available on your iPhone or iPad to help you find exactly the right action word within seconds.\n\nActors need actions. You cannot act moods. You need to be doing something with every line. You need an aim to achieve, and an action selected to help achieve that aim. ‘Actions’ are active verbs. In order to play a line truthfully, you need to discover the action that suits that particular situation and that particular line. That is where this app comes in…\n\nIt is a fully searchable, easy-to-navigate thesaurus of active verbs, that will help you refine your acting choice until you find the action you require to make each line come alive.\n\nFeatures include:\n\n·  A to Z search, and predictive search function\n·  Emotional groupings to help you pinpoint the action you require\n·  Bookmark, note-making and random word functions\n·  Share your actions on social media or by email\n·  Full instructions on how to use actioning in rehearsal, plus how to use the app\n\nFor actors at all levels and of all ages, Actions: The Actors’ Thesaurus will revolutionise how you rehearse. Once you’ve started using it, you’ll wonder how you ever managed without it.\n\n‘If you want to act, or act better, Actions will take you a long way on the journey to excellence’ Terry Johnson\n\n'Actioning ain't easy – but it's so useful' Zawe Ashton\n\nBased on the bestselling book Actions: The Actors’ Thesaurus by Marina Caldarone and Maggie Lloyd-Williams"

You can create a favorites list of your most frequently used kits for faster access to those kits rather than searching through the entire app database every time you need to reference those kits. You can also reorder the database by your preferred supplier order.\n\nThe app also includes a drill bit converter for converting between inch fractional, inch decimal, metric and gauge drill sizes. Conversions to inch fractional are made to the nearest 1/64\" and conversions to gauge drill size are made to the nearest gauge drill size (107-1 and A-Z). An error factor is displayed for inexact conversions to inch fractional and gauge drill size.\n\nA 30-digit, 4-function calculator is included in the app. It has several advanced features not found in many simple calculators including a memory cell and the ability to display data in decimal or scientific notation.\n\nPhotos, Instructions and Bushing Drawings are available for most of the kits. When instructions or bushings are available, they may be viewed, mailed or printed.\n\nThe app also contains several lists of useful references: Worldwide Suppliers of pen kits with links to take you directly to their web site; Helpful Penturning videos with links that will take you directly to the video; and Penturning Tutorials with links that will download the tutorial to your device for viewing in the app or to email or print.\n\nThe app will automatically download database updates and the kit reference files from the IAP server."

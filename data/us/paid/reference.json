Quickly find rhymes, near rhymes (including slant rhymes), synonyms, antonyms, homophones, similar sounding words, words with the same consonant pattern, and other related words (generalizations, specializations, words appearing in the same context). Use Apple's local dictionaries or ours online if you are unsure of any meanings.\n\nYou get a database of over 150,000 words and phrases right at your fingertips. Find rhymes without an Internet connection, but if you are online, we'll connect you to RhymeZone.com for definitions and all the other great features you've come to love, ad-free! Or you can look it up on our sister site, OneLook.com, or even hear it pronounced with your device's built-in text-to-speech.\n\nThere's also a nifty \"Poet Maker\" feature, which lets you find words that match constraints on both rhyme and meaning at the same time. For example, suppose you want a word that rhymes with \"cat\" and means \"heavy\"; this feature will answer \"fat\" in no time. Or suppose you're looking for a rhyme of \"curious\" that means \"invalid\"; you'll get \"spurious\". You get the idea!\n\nSo whether you're aspiring to be the next Shakespeare, looking to put on the finishing touches of a love poem, bust out the next rap lyric, or just seeking some clever wordplay for your English assignment, give the app a try!"

It is an invaluable resource written when American values and patriotism were based on Christian values.\n\nOf interest to poets and writers, The Noah Webster dictionary was used extensively by Emily Dickinson. We know that she made frequent and extensive use of Noah Webster's American Dictionary of the English Language in writing her poems, paying attention not only to the definitions but also to Webster's etymologies and his illustrative quotations.\n\nBeing able to see how definitions have evolved today is fascinating, and a great resource when studying.\n\nYou can easily search or browse the entire dictionary and add favourites to revisit later.\n\nApp design by professional app developer NASDA Studios."

In this way the Strong's Concordance provides an independent check against translations, and offers an opportunity for greater, and more technically accurate understanding of the Bible text.\n\nWant to see it in action before you buy? Try Strong's Concordance Lite which provides a 100% functional demo of Matthew and Genesis.\n\nThis program does not require internet access, everything you need is all stored on the iDevice.\n\nFeatures:\n* Search for English words, and lookup Greek/Hebrew dictionaries.\n* Proper concordance, listing how the word was translated in other bible verses.\n* Full King James Text is included\n* Click on any blue word for concordance text.\n* Night mode for those that like to read at night (White on black)\n* iPad support\n\nPlease note: This version is not an \"exhaustive\" concordance, and does skip smaller words such as \"and, or, the, a\" as well as some other words. Though we think you'll find it has most (if not all) the words you'll ever need.\n\nWe're open to suggestions for improvement in future versions. Send comments and suggestions to strongs at orionsys.org."

      "label": "SkySafari 6 Pro will revolutionize your astronomical viewing experience.  It has the largest database of any astronomy app, includes every solar system object ever discovered, offers unparalleled accuracy, flawless telescope control, Augmented Reality (AR) mode, and provides the very best experience under the stars when you depend on it. Discover why SkySafari 6 Pro is the #1 recommended astronomy app for serious amateur astronomers since 2009.\n\nHere's what's new in version 6:\n\n1) Complete support for iOS 13 and iPhone 11. We release regular updates.\n\n2) Clouds and Astronomy. Two words that rarely go together. SkySafari 6 Pro will (optionally) back up all of your observing data in our secure cloud storage and make it easily accessible to multiple devices as well as from our new web interface, LiveSky.com.\n\n3) We Have The Best Stars. Precise, modern and deep. We’ve updated our star catalog to use the latest and greatest, UCAC5 star catalog. If 25 million stars down to 15th magnitude isn’t enough for you, an easy in-app purchase gets you down to 16.5 magnitude and a whopping 100 million stars!\n\n4) We Have The Best Galaxies. The PGC catalog includes galaxies down to 18th magnitude. Want more galaxies? How about 2.6 million more? An in-app purchase gives you access to the largest galaxy database available for your device.\n\n5) Observers First. A redesign of our tools puts the active observer first. Quick access to features like your equipment, observing sites, lists, and observations make it easy and enjoyable to get out, observe, and record your observations. The observing sessions feature lets you collect your observations into groups that span a few hours, or a few nights.\n\n6) Graph It. The completely new graph tool will give a quick visual representation of an object’s altitude above the horizon. Essential for planning your night’s observations.\n\n7) Plan It. Make the most of your time under the stars. Our updated planner is a powerful tool that lets you create a list of targets for your observing session with filters like object types, specific time ranges, constellation, catalog, and more. Plan it and get more done.\n\n8) Say It. Ever just wanted to just yell at your device and tell it what to do!? SkySafari 6 adds basic voice control for a wide range of operations. Say “select Jupiter,” “search for Titan,” “center on Polaris” and SkySafari will do the work for you. Yelling optional. \n\n9) Tilt It. Every old astronomy app these days lets your tilt and pan your device to show different parts of the sky, but who else lets you control your telescope that way!? “Tilt to slew” is an optional mode allowing you to keep your eye in the eyepiece, and, using the accelerometers in your device, gently translate the movements of your hands into smooth telescope motion.\n\n10) Share It. SkySafari 6 is more than just a mobile app, it’s a new system to help organize and share your observing experiences. With a free signup, you can see and share your observing data from our web portal, LiveSky.com! Affordable premium memberships add online editing, so you can not only view, but edit your observations, add new observing sites, manage your equipment and more. Finally, (coming soon) you can view, edit and manage your settings files with SkySafari Web, our fully functional web version.\n\nIf you haven't used SkySafari 6 Pro before, here's what you can do with it:\n\n• Hold your device up, and SkySafari 6 Pro will find stars, constellations, planets, and more! The star chart updates automatically with your movements for the ultimate stargazing experience.\n\n• Simulate the night sky up to 10,000 years in the past or future! Animate meteor showers, conjunctions, eclipses, and other celestial events.\n\n• Control your telescope, log and plan your observations.\n\n• Night Vision.\n\n• Orbit Mode. Leave the Earth’s surface behind, and fly through our solar system.\n\n• Galaxy View shows the position of deep sky objects in our Milky Way!\n\n• Much more!"

This application adds reference sources for Alpha Call-Up Parameters and the very long list of abbreviations used in Airbus manuals.\n\nSystem Resets:  There is a primary reference of aircraft systems documenting the control or CB actions required to reset that system.  \n\nECAM Warnings:  There is an extensive list of ECAM warnings that can be viewed as a single list or navigated by ATA chapter.  Selecting a warning shows the reset procedure for the responsible system.  Selecting an ECAM warning from the list takes you directly to the system reset procedure.\n\nCircuit Breakers:  All CB locations & labels can be displayed sorted by name or panel/location.  A search function will find all circuit breakers matching a user defined clue.\n\nAlpha Parameters:  A comprehensive list of Alpha Call-Up Parameters may be viewed sorted by Code, System or ATA chapter enabling the user to interrogate the contents of the various data registers. This single verbose list contains all codes for aircraft that have diverse engine, APU or avionic fits.\n\nAirbus Abbreviations:  A decode of the many abbreviations used by Airbus in technical documents.  The list my be searched or viewed sorted by Subject Area or Code.\n\nThis application is in no way sponsored or connected with Airbus SAS.

      "label": "Pocket Rally Dog Obedience for the iPhone was completely rewritten with the new signs, descriptions and videos for the March, 2017 AKC changes. It also includes the changes as noted in the February, 2019 descriptions.\n\nPocket Rally includes descriptions of the rally signs, short \"real world\" video demonstrations of how each sign should be performed. A section for random sign generation for practice, an audio sign Callout Section, and links to the official AKC YouTube videos (internet connection required). It also includes a little memory game, and a mini course designer.\n\nIf you like the app, please take time to give it a positive review. A lot of time and energy is spent in the creation of an application like this, it is always nice to read some encouraging words. \n\nDo you have an idea that you would like to see in the app? Please drop us a note at our support website. \n\nThank you for your interest in Pocket Rally and remember to enjoy your dog!"

      "label": "iBird Yard Plus Guide to Birds has 270 species of North America. It is designed specifically for the 126 species of garden and yard birds found in North America and Hawaii and an additional 144 species of common birds most birders are likely to see such as ducks, hawks, seabirds, etc. If you are new to birding, iBird Yard Plus is an inexpensive way to become intimate with these amazing creatures. Just set up a small bird feeder in your yard and start discovering the beautiful species that thrive in your area. iBird Yard Plus is completely up to date with the 2017 AOU supplement and contains hundreds of bird songs and calls you can play from the app to attract birds to your feeders. Birders with more experience may want to review our iBird Plus, Pro and Ultimate products.\n\nMore Details of What’s New: bit.ly/ibird-whatsnew\n\niBird Yard Plus also takes a major leap forward with “Time of Day” filtering available in version 10.06. You can now search for birds by activity levels during day or night (Cathemeral), dawn and dusk (Crepuscular), during the day (Diurnal) or during the night (Nocturnal).\n\nAlso included in this version is our new Owls of Mexico and Central America package, including all the hard to find details which iBird is so well known for: illustrations with field marks, range maps, songs and calls and much more.\n\nWith iBird’s Percevia™ matching system you can search for birds by color, location, shape, habitat or any one of 37 identification attributes to find your bird. iBird's comprehensive species pages have hundreds of built-in bird song recordings, professional high-resolution bird photographs, hand-drawn composite illustrations and range maps with detailed migration paths.\n\n** NOTE: If you would like to try out iBird without spending any money, check the newly released iBird LITE Free Guide to Birds of North America. It contains all the features of paid iBird Ultimate, including BAM, but contains just 50 species. And it’s completely FREE. **\n\nWhether you are an experienced birder or a beginner, iBird Yard Plus is the best way to learn all about the birds in your garden.  \n\nFeatures\n\n■ iBird now takes advantage of the high-resolution retina displays of the iPhone and iPad so the screen shows more information than ever.\n\n■ Birds Around Me and Percevia smart search now available as in-app purchases.\n\n■ Contains the latest 2017 AOU checklists.\n\n■ Splits-History lets you see what birds have had name changes, have been split into more than one species or lumped into one species.\n\n■ iBird’s icon-driven visual search engine, enables you to identify birds using shape, color, location, habitat, head pattern, flight pattern, bill shape, length and more.\n\n■ Voluminous identification and hard-to-find details such as diet, nest information, egg color, sex of incubator, vocalization definitions, and more.\n\n■ The only birding app that includes both Illustrations and Photos.\n\n■ The powerful search engine means no longer scrolling through hundreds of the wrong choices. iBird matches just those birds near you that fit your description.\n\n■ Many hours of highest quality bird sound recordings. \n\n■ Sort birds by first, last and family name and view birds by text, icon, thumbnail or gallery.\n\n■ Search by common name, Latin name and even band code.\n\n■ Only app with a field mark layer which displays key ID marks for male, female, juvenile.\n\n■ Post, keep lists, and share sightings with friends and followers with an easy and user-friendly Notes and Favorites interface.\n\n■ iBird’s database is completely self-contained; no internet connection is required like many other birding apps.\n\nOther Features\n\n■ All new range maps now include Summer, Winter, Spring and Fall ranges plus Year-round and Migration ranges.\n\n■ The Conservation Status search attribute lets you filter birds by 6 threat levels.\n\n■ Species, common and family names in English, French and Spanish (text is English)."

      "label": "This application is for any gun owner! The purpose of this app is for the legal and conscientious concealed carry license holder to know where they cannot legally carry before getting there. A licensed permit holder or a resident of a constitutional carry state can usually legally carry their firearm in any location other than statutory \"no carry\" locations such as schools, gov. buildings, etc., and in businesses that are posted prohibiting firearms. This is a list of those Posted Anti-Gun businesses. \n\nThis #1-selling app of its kind (both on Apple App Store and other platforms) already includes over 19,000 current anti-gun locations and 17,000 pro-2a alternatives.\n\nFind hotels where you can’t carry before booking a trip to one. Find restaurants where you cannot carry before making dinner plans. Find stores to avoid before you step out the door. It is extremely inconvenient to not find out until you get to a location that they prohibit your second amendment rights. You have to either disarm in the parking lot (causing your vehicle to be a target for thieves) or go somewhere else at the last second. If you know beforehand, you can avoid the places that prohibit carry, or you can leave your firearm at home if you must attend. \n\nWe have a comprehensive list of \"Posted anti-gun\" locations collected in Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin. We have assembled smaller lists in  Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Idaho, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Utah, West Virginia, and Wyoming; provided by many great gun forums and sites with their permission. Since it is crowd-sourced by users like you, please help the list continue to grow!\n\nThe app also includes the option to add pro-gun alternatives that do not prohibit carry.  Search for pro-gun substitutes to the anti-gun businesses.  Easily add new ones to the list every time you experience firearm-friendly (or neutral) service.\n\nThis app includes the easy ability to take action.  Call or email a listed business to let them know your opinion!\n\nLaws regarding signage, and prohibited locations (no sign needed) vary by state. To understand your state’s specific laws, download \"CCW – 50 State Guide\" (http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id443321291). \n\nThis list is user-updated, and will continue to get better over time. But this relies on you! If you go to a place not on the list and they have a sign, please add it with a few clicks via the \"Add a Business\" button! If a place had taken down their sign, get it removed the same way! If you already have a list of anti-gun businesses in your area or state, send us an email. We would love to include any data you have collected, and give you credit for it! \n\nIf you experience any bugs or issues, please email (using the \"Feedback\" button) before leaving app feedback. \n\nDisclaimer: This application implies no warranty regarding the ability to legally carry in any locale or situation and does not constitute legal advice. Every user is responsible for knowing and abiding by the laws in his or her state. Some areas are illegal to carry by statute, even without signage. If unsure, contact local law enforcement or legal counsel. All information provided is simply the opinion of various users who added the location. By downloading and/or purchasing the application, you agree that you assume all risk and are responsible for confirming legality and abiding by all firearm laws. Please see full Disclaimer on Developer Website (below).\n\nThis application was built by Nantz Consulting & Workman Consulting LLC."

      "label": "R is a free statistical, visualisation and data manipulation software. Anyone who works with data can benefit from using R but it is hard to learn. \n\nCreated by scientist and educator Dr Shidan Murphy, R Instructor is a statistical and R reference guide. The application uses plain, non-technical language and over 35 succinct videos to guide new users and reinforce concepts for advanced R users. The number and scope of the videos and content will continue to increase.\n\nR Instructor will teach you how to use R, how to make and modify plots and run statistical tests. Each example includes a very brief (and easy to understand!) description of the function or test, any statistical assumptions, how to structure your data in R, the R scripts (code) and, links to other free and online resources.  Where appropriate, the Mac, Windows and RStudio versions of the R interface are explained separately.\n\nR Instructor also allows you to run RStudio through the web from your iPad or iPhone (Note: This is a public server that requires an internet connection -- do not expect to accomplish serious computing)\n\nIn addition, R Instructor comes complete with 10 Quick Reference guides and the \"Which Test?\" feature. The \"Which Test?\" feature guides you to the correct statistical test after you answer questions related to your data.\n\n\nSee a demonstration of R Instructor at, www.Rinstructor.com\n\nUse R Instructor to...\n\nRun a public web server implementation of RStudio (do not expect serious computing power -- this server is for testing and debugging scripts)\n\n\nLearn R's fundamentals:\n- R's interface\n- Create objects\n- Install libraries\\packages\n- Import and export data and plots\n- Merge data frames\n- Exclude redundant data between datasets\n- Import dates\n- Create custom functions\n- Summarize data frames and matrices\n- Perform calculations\n- and more...\n\nLearn how to make and customize plots:\n- qplots from ggplot2\n- Box plots\n- Bar plots\n- Histograms\n- Line charts\n- Scatter plots and scatter plot matrices\n- Add and customize legends\n- Add custom axis labels\n- Modify the size, shape and colour of point markers\n- Add axis titles\n- Add lines, text or points to an existing plot\n- Add colour to the plot background, border lines… and just about anything else!\n\n\nLearn these (and more) statistical tests:\n- One-sample t-test\n- Two-sample t-test\n- Paired t-test\n- Correlation\n- Rank correlation\n- Linear regression\n- Multiple regression\n- Logistic regression\n- Log-linear models\n- F-test\n- One-way ANOVA\n- Two-way ANOVA\n- One-way repeated measures ANOVA \n- Two-way repeated measures ANOVA  \n- Regression and Classification trees\n- ANCOVA\n- MANOVA\n- Principal Components Analysis\n- Linear discriminant function analysis\n- Redundancy analysis\n- Friedman test\n- Wilcoxon signed rank test\n- Kruskal-Wallis test\n- Chi-square test of independence\n- Binomial test\n- Hierarchical clustering\n- and more…\n\nPlus,\n- Over 35 videos (that's over two hours)\n- 10 Quick Reference Guides\n- The \"Which test?\" feature – An assistant to guide you to the appropriate statistical test"

Many species are represented with multiple call examples showing the full range of vocalizations.\n● The ability to compare any two images, maps, or sounds, side by side on the screen. The ability to filter by geographic location, so that you see only the species likely to occur in your location, and to further reduce the possibilities to usual or vagrant species in the selected area.\n● A “Smart Search” that gives the ability to search by distinguishing features such as size, colour, physical features, habitat and exclude certain types of birds (eg. Passerines).\n● A basic personal species list that stores your sightings saved to the device* (ability to upload list coming soon)\n● A comprehensive help and introduction section to help you if you get stuck or don’t understand how a certain feature works.\n\n*Uninstalling/reinstalling the program will result in the loss of your list, it is recommended that you keep your own backup (master list) separate from the application.\n\nWe invite all users to share their comments and ideas on our forum at www.mydigitalearth.com \n\nNB. This Application WILL ONLY work on an iPhone or iPod Touch running iOS V7.1 or higher NOT A NORMAL IPOD CLASSIC/NANO and the download is about 320MB."

The HIN will include when the boat was built, and by who. With the included Manufacturer database, HIN Search can also tell you a little bit about the builder, such as if they are still in business, their address, and sometimes even a website.\n\nWhat this app DOES NOT do:\n  •  Retrieve boat model information other than year. This information is NOT encoded universally in the HIN. If the boat manufacturer is still in business, please contact them directly with your HIN.\n  •  Tell you if the boat is stolen. We can tell you if the boat HIN looks suspicious and warrants a closer look, but that's it. \n  •  Decode boat identification numbers for boat built before 1972.\n  •  Retrieve boat's past or current owners or sale information. Please contact your local vehicle registration authority.\n\nPlease don't leave a negative review with regards to what is clearly stated above!\n\nThis app only decodes HINs for boats which were built or imported legally in the USA since 1972. Some older (1970s) boat manufacturers \"in business\" dates may be incorrect. The USCG records are sometimes inaccurate.\n\nThis is a great tool for both marine professionals and boat shoppers!\n\nNo limits on number of HINs you can decode, or manufacturers you can look up.\n\nNo hidden or extra fees. Buy once, use forever.\n\nAd free, and will relieve you of scratching your head wondering, \"Who made that boat?\""

      "label": "Based on David Wagner’s renowned Princeton field guide Caterpillars of Eastern North America, this exciting new app is the ultimate digital pocket guide for quickly and easily identifying the most common native caterpillar species in Eastern North America—and for keeping a personalized log of your sightings! Covering 576 species and featuring more than 1,200 superb color images, the app is also useful for identifying caterpillars in the whole of southern Canada, parts of the Pacific Northwest, and, at a generic level, in most of the United States west of the Mississippi. \n\nFocusing on the larger, commonly encountered caterpillars that are most popular with gardeners, naturalists, and children, the app is designed to be enjoyed by nature lovers, hikers, and families, as well as by field biologists, zoologists, and other professionals. \n\nEach of the 576 species is illustrated with 1 to 4 photos, with most of the main pictures showing the full-grown caterpillar, and other photos showing color variations and, for 383 species, the adult butterfly or moth as well. An abundance of information is given for each species, including taxonomy, description, occurrence, food, and additional interesting facts. All species are listed by their scientific and common names and can easily be compared by browsing according to their taxonomic classification.\n\nA simple identification key narrows down potential species and consists of a choice of 9 major morphological traits, including 42 sub-traits, ranging from color combinations to body features, such as tails, knobs, and hair.\n\n•\tCovers 576 caterpillar species\n•\tFeatures 1,216 superb color images\n•\tOffers 3 ways to sort and display species: gallery, A–Z, or taxonomic \n•\tLists caterpillars by their common and scientific names\n•\tAllows you to compare caterpillars next to each other—up to 8 on an iPhone and 16 on an iPad\n•\tEnables you to log your sightings, make notes for each, and sort your list by place, date, group, and name\n•\tPlots sightings automatically on an editable map via GPS\n•\tIncludes export function for sending each list to any email address as a CSV data file\n\nOnce you download the app, no internet connection is needed—just get the app and get started!\n\nVisit our website for further information: \nhttp://sunbird.tv/de/sunbird-apps-ebooks/"

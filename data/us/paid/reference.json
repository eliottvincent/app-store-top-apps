Quickly find rhymes, near rhymes (including slant rhymes), synonyms, antonyms, homophones, similar sounding words, words with the same consonant pattern, and other related words (generalizations, specializations, words appearing in the same context). Use Apple's local dictionaries or ours online if you are unsure of any meanings.\n\nYou get a database of over 150,000 words and phrases right at your fingertips. Find rhymes without an Internet connection, but if you are online, we'll connect you to RhymeZone.com for definitions and all the other great features you've come to love, ad-free! Or you can look it up on our sister site, OneLook.com, or even hear it pronounced with your device's built-in text-to-speech.\n\nThere's also a nifty \"Poet Maker\" feature, which lets you find words that match constraints on both rhyme and meaning at the same time. For example, suppose you want a word that rhymes with \"cat\" and means \"heavy\"; this feature will answer \"fat\" in no time. Or suppose you're looking for a rhyme of \"curious\" that means \"invalid\"; you'll get \"spurious\". You get the idea!\n\nSo whether you're aspiring to be the next Shakespeare, looking to put on the finishing touches of a love poem, bust out the next rap lyric, or just seeking some clever wordplay for your English assignment, give the app a try!"

It has the largest database of any astronomy app, includes every solar system object ever discovered, offers unparalleled accuracy, advanced planning and logging tools, flawless telescope control, and provides the very best experience under the stars when you depend on it. Don’t postpone joy. Discover why SkySafari is the #1 recommended astronomy app for serious amateur astronomers since 2009.\n\nHere's what’s new in version 7:\n\n+ Complete support for iOS 15 and iPhone 13. Version 7 brings a new and immersive stargazing experience.\n\n+ Events Finder - go to the new Events section to unlock a powerful search engine that finds astronomical events visible tonight and far into the future. The finder dynamically generates a listing of moon phases, eclipses, planetary moon events, meteor showers and planetary phenomenon such as conjunctions, elongations and oppositions.\n\n+ Notifications - the notifications section has been completely revamped to allow you to customize and manage which events trigger an alert notification on your device.\n\n+ Telescope Support - telescope control is at the heart of SkySafari.  Version 7 takes a giant leap forward by supporting ASCOM Alpaca and INDI.  These next generation control protocols allow you to effortlessly connect to hundreds of compatible astronomical devices.\n\nStargazing is often done on your own but looking up at the stars reminds us that we are all part of a larger interconnected universe. SkySafari 7 brings social stargazing to mobile devices with two new features to help you connect with other like minded people.\n\nOneSky - allows you to see what other users are observing, in real time.  This feature highlights objects in the sky chart and indicates with a number how many users are observing a particular object.\n\nSkyCast - allows you to guide a friend or group around the night sky through their own copy of SkySafari. After initiating SkyCast, you can generate a link and conveniently share it with other SkySafari users via text message, apps or social media accounts.\n\n+ Sky Tonight -  jump to the new Tonight section to see what’s visible in your sky tonight.  Expanded information has been designed to help plan your night and includes  Moon & Sun info, calendar curations, events and the best positioned deep sky and solar system objects.\n\n+ Improved Observation Tools - SkySafari is the perfect tool to help you plan, record and organize your observations.  New workflows make it easier to add, search, filter and sort data.\n\nThe Small Touches:\n\n+ You can now edit the Jupiter GRS Longitude Value in the Settings.\n+ Better Moon Age calculation.\n+ New grid & reference options allow you to display Solstice and Equinox markers, Orbit + Node markers for all solar system objects, and tick marks and labels for the Ecliptic, Meridian, and Equator reference lines.\n+ Previous In-app Purchases are Now Free -  this includes the H-R diagram, 3D Galaxy view, and the PGC galaxy and GAIA star catalogs. Enjoy.\n+ Many more.\n\nIf you haven't used SkySafari 7 Pro before, here's what you can do with it:\n\n+ Hold your device up, and SkySafari 7 Pro will find stars, constellations, planets, and more! The star chart updates automatically with your movements for the ultimate stargazing experience.\n\n+ Simulate the night sky up to 100,000 years in the past or future! Animate meteor showers, conjunctions, eclipses, and other celestial events.\n\n+ Control your telescope, log and plan your observations.\n\n+ Optionally backup all of your observing data in our secure cloud storage and make it easily accessible to multiple devices as well as from our new web interface, LiveSky.com.\n\n+ Augmented Reality (AR) mode\n\n+ Night Vision.\n\n+ Orbit Mode. Leave the Earth’s surface behind, and fly through our solar system.\n\n+ Galaxy View shows the position of deep sky objects in our Milky Way!\n\n+ Much more!"

It is an invaluable resource written when American values and patriotism were based on Christian values.\n\nOf interest to poets and writers, The Noah Webster dictionary was used extensively by Emily Dickinson. We know that she made frequent and extensive use of Noah Webster's American Dictionary of the English Language in writing her poems, paying attention not only to the definitions but also to Webster's etymologies and his illustrative quotations.\n\nBeing able to see how definitions have evolved today is fascinating, and a great resource when studying.\n\nYou can easily search or browse the entire dictionary and add favourites to revisit later.\n\nApp design by professional app developer NASDA Studios."

Let scripture interpret scripture.\n\nSTART LEARNING PRECEPTS NOW!\n- Start by reading the verses and passages related to each precept;\n- Get the understanding of the precept by reading the cross-linked verses;\n- You begin to see the consistency in scripture when you realise that certain words and phrases maintain specific meaning in all the verses they appear in;\n- Connect the dots and you begin to see the bigger picture of what the bible is really revealing.\n\nMORE FEATURES WITH EACH UPDATE\n- Easy navigation for chapters and verses;\n- Quickly check up on precepts listed under a verse, and link to cross-linked verses;\n- Adjust font sizes for accessibility;\n- Use the contact form to send us messages and what you've discovered;\n- Join our mailing list and get updates about our occasional updates and learning aids;\n\nREDISCOVER THE CORRECT WAY TO UNDERSTAND SCRIPTURE\n- Build up entire teaching series using bible precepts to maintain true scriptural meanings and consistency in the understanding delivered.\n\nJoin us on social media and share the gospel to wake up the lost sheep!\nShare this app with friends and family and be part of their awakening."

      "label": "The Lost Person Behavior App is based upon the Search and Rescue (SAR) international gold standard reference tool on where to look for lost and missing persons. Every Public Safety Official needs to know where the missing person might be, what to ask, where to look, and what to do when minutes matter. The app was built around the field needs of Public Safety Officials.  No matter how remote the location, the app continues to function since no network connection is required, once installed.\n\nThis life-saving information is customized for 41 different subject categories. The categories are organized into a hierarchy of groups including external factors (abductions, aircraft), water incidents (boats and persons in the water), wheeled incidents (ATV, mountain bikes, vehicles, etc.), mental states (autism, dementia, despondent, intellectual disability, mental illness, substance intoxication), children (in five different age groups), and eighteen outdoor activities (hiker, hunter, climber, gatherer, skier, etc.).\n\nThe app guides the user in selecting the correct subject category by several means. The subject category wizard allows the user to select potential scenarios and then will suggest the best match for the subject category.  For example, if a child was riding his bicycle and was then known to be abducted, the user could select Child, Wheel/Motorized, and Abduction; the wizard would suggest using the abduction category. Alternately, the user can go straight to a subject category by using favorites, an alphabetical list, or the hierarchy list. Once the subject category is selected, the Lost Person Behavior App provides the user with: \n•\tbehavioral profiles\n•\ttactical briefings\n•\tspecific investigative questions\n•\tspatial and survival statistics\n•\tsuggestions for initial tasks (reflex tasking).\n\nThe all-new tactical briefings distill the statistics and profiles to the key points that every field searcher must know. The more extensive profile, full statistics, and suggested initial tasks assist even the seasoned search planner. The highly detailed questions for the investigation resulted from decades of SAR experience and thousands of missions.\n\nThe app even allows you to email a checklist of these critical tasks and interview questions so that you may print them out.  The email could also be used for providing remote support or documenting tasks that have been completed.\n\nDetermining where to look is one of the major functions of the search statistics, which are now provided in a graphical and tabular format.  The statistics from thousands of SAR missions allow the search planner to see where similar previous search subjects were found. The SAR statistics include:\n•\tDistance from the Initial Planning Point\n•\tElevation model (likelihood of going up, down, or staying at the same elevation)\n•\tMobility model (how long will the subject keep moving)\n•\tDispersion angle (given a direction of travel, how well does that predict subject’s location)\n•\tTrack Offset model (how far away from a feature such as a road or trail is subject found)\n•\tFind location (at what type of geographic feature was the subject found)\n•\tScenario (what caused the subject to become missing)\n•\tSurvivability overall (what is the overall chance of finding the subject alive or injured)\n•\tSurvivability rate (how does survivability rate change in 24-hour increments).\n\nThe Lost Person Behavior App can be easily customized to only show the statistical information you actually need. The user can customize for ecoregion, terrain, and urban incidents. The user can view the data in both metric and English units. Several additional helpful tools are built into the app. Contextual help is provided on every page with additional information boxes, which explain every element of the app on the page you need.  The information page provides information about the bike wheel model used to describe initial tactical deployment (reflex tasking), a glossary, help, and contact information."

With the aid of it, you can easily find out, which tones will create the most advantageous composition. Using such schemes you can readily combine from 2 to 4 colors in solving a variety of problems connected with pictorial art, photography and even interior decoration. \nThis application will let you work wisely and efficiently with the color palette using six different schemes. Based on the contrasts or, on the contrary, on the law of assimilation, they let you introduce harmony into any artistic solutions, choose the necessary color and detach the predominant hue."

It allows sorting by distance or by Trustee callsign as well as filtering by band and radius in miles or kilometers.\n\nNOW RFinder Routing is integrated with RT Systems radio programmers! Your subscription bought here by installing this app gives you access in RT...just make sure RT is updated to the latest version by pressing Help-Update. Click File-External Data->RFinder Web Search and click Route! Easy as pie to program your radio now for a trip you are taking with just a few easy clicks...check out the tutorial video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaeRzcnNNdQ\n\nNOW INCLUDES SOCIAL FUNCTIONS!!!! In the repeater detail screen, click the Check In button. All users will see that you are on that machine! This can be used to find your friends or a machine with a user on it. In the settings bundle app/RFinder you can turn on APRS posting. This posts your current position with the repeater you are checked into. You can also let your friends on Facebook® know what repeater you are on as well as your Twitter® followers, when checking in.\n\nNOW INTEGRATED WITH THE EchoLink APP!!\nFrom the repeater detail screen, any repeater that has an Echolink node attached just touch the number and if you have the EchoLink app installed it will launch to that node automatically for you.\n\nOur repeater locator database is growing daily.\nAccess to the Directory is included for one year then it will be an annual subscription for $9.99, and your subscription works for all platforms.... Each purchase of a new platform advances your annual to a year from that new purchase date. Sub\n\nIf we do not have your repeaters listed...please do not refund or give us a bad rating...add repeaters at http://add.rfinder.net or request an add or update from the app.. Don't forget LAT/LON (in decimal), use periods as decimals, please.\n\nThe application accesses our Worldwide Repeater Directory and scanner directory for Amateur Radio (Ham Radio) but only stores information for repeaters within approximately 80 miles (125 km) from your location on your handheld at any one time, saving you room on your device and allowing distance calculation and mapping features to operate smoothly. It uses geolocation either via cell tower triangulation, GPS or manual location entry (so you can look up the repeaters you will use on vacation or business trips, etc.).\n\nIf anyone has lists of Amateur Radio repeaters from their countries we would love to incorporate that into our database.\n\nWorldwide IRLP and Echolink nodes.\n\n© ITWeRKS 2011"

      "label": "This application is for any gun owner! The purpose of this app is for the legal and conscientious concealed carry license holder to know where they cannot legally carry before getting there. A licensed permit holder or a resident of a constitutional carry state can usually legally carry their firearm in any location other than statutory \"no carry\" locations such as schools, gov. buildings, etc., and in businesses that are posted prohibiting firearms. This is a list of those Posted Anti-Gun businesses. \n\nThis #1-selling app of its kind (both on Apple App Store and other platforms) already includes over 19,000 current anti-gun locations and 17,000 pro-2a alternatives.\n\nFind hotels where you can’t carry before booking a trip to one. Find restaurants where you cannot carry before making dinner plans. Find stores to avoid before you step out the door. It is extremely inconvenient to not find out until you get to a location that they prohibit your second amendment rights. You have to either disarm in the parking lot (causing your vehicle to be a target for thieves) or go somewhere else at the last second. If you know beforehand, you can avoid the places that prohibit carry, or you can leave your firearm at home if you must attend. \n\nWe have a comprehensive list of \"Posted anti-gun\" locations collected in Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin. We have assembled smaller lists in  Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Idaho, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Utah, West Virginia, and Wyoming; provided by many great gun forums and sites with their permission. Since it is crowd-sourced by users like you, please help the list continue to grow!\n\nThe app also includes the option to add pro-gun alternatives that do not prohibit carry.  Search for pro-gun substitutes to the anti-gun businesses.  Easily add new ones to the list every time you experience firearm-friendly (or neutral) service.\n\nThis app includes the easy ability to take action.  Call or email a listed business to let them know your opinion!\n\nLaws regarding signage, and prohibited locations (no sign needed) vary by state. To understand your state’s specific laws, download \"CCW – 50 State Guide\" (http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id443321291). \n\nThis list is user-updated, and will continue to get better over time. But this relies on you! If you go to a place not on the list and they have a sign, please add it with a few clicks via the \"Add a Business\" button! If a place had taken down their sign, get it removed the same way! If you already have a list of anti-gun businesses in your area or state, send us an email. We would love to include any data you have collected, and give you credit for it! \n\nIf you experience any bugs or issues, please email (using the \"Feedback\" button) before leaving app feedback. \n\nDisclaimer: This application implies no warranty regarding the ability to legally carry in any locale or situation and does not constitute legal advice. Every user is responsible for knowing and abiding by the laws in his or her state. Some areas are illegal to carry by statute, even without signage. If unsure, contact local law enforcement or legal counsel. All information provided is simply the opinion of various users who added the location. By downloading and/or purchasing the application, you agree that you assume all risk and are responsible for confirming legality and abiding by all firearm laws. Please see full Disclaimer on Developer Website (below).\n\nThis application was built by Nantz Consulting & Workman Consulting LLC."

God is a God of order as evidenced in His works of creation and redemption. Consequently, order belongs to the essence of His church. Order is achieved through principles and regulations that guide the Church in its internal operations and in fulfillmenting its mission to the world. In order for it to be a successful ecclesiastical organization at the service of the Lord and humanity, it needs order, rule, and discipline. Scripture affirms that “all things be done decently and in order” (1 Cor. 14:40)."

      "label": "A great resource for those who want to go back and forth between Maya and Christian Calendar dates.  No internet connection needed, so it can be in your pocket as you travel through Maya ruins and use it to calculate the Gregorian calendar dates from Maya long counts on monuments.\n\nMaya Calendar gives you the Maya calendar date for today or any date in history – past, present, and future.  Convert dates back and forth between the Maya and Gregorian calendars, learn about the various Maya cycles of time, and gain a better understanding of why December 21, 2012 A.D. is an important Maya date.\n\nIn addition, this app can calculate your birthday in the Maya sacred calendar and learn what it says about your personality traits and destiny.\n\nMaya Calendar offers these great features:\n\n– The Home Page displays the current day in the Maya Calendar, both in hieroglyphs and in modern text formats.\n\n– “This Day in Maya History” cites a major event in Maya history for almost every day of the year.\n\n–  The “Maya Calendars” section provides a detailed explanation of each of the major Maya calendrical cycles, a discussion of the calendar correlation debate, and the thinking behind the possible end date of 2012 A.D.\n\n– The “Calculator” allows you to convert any Gregorian date into its Maya calendar equivalent.\n\n– The “Long Count” feature allows you to convert any Maya Long Count date into its Gregorian calendar equivalent. \n\n– The “Birthdays” feature allows you to calculate and store the Maya birthdays of everyone you know. Once calculated, the app provides a host of information about that individual: personality traits; animal, color, and directional associations; and events in Maya history that occurred on the same date as their birth.\n\n– The “Known Birthdays” feature lists and saves the names of everyone whose Maya birthday you have recorded and notifies you when their birthday comes around.\n\n– “What to Do Today” lists the activities that modern Maya calendar priests recommend for any given day.\n\nMaya Calendar, created by Dr. Ed Barnhart, is an invaluable tool for students investigating Maya inscriptions, and for anyone fascinated with the workings of the Maya calendar."

It also includes extensive reference material on everything you need to know about your tires, from the information on your tire's sidewall, displayed in both table and glossary format.\r\n\r\nUseful for:\r\n• Calculating the difference between your current tire/wheel size and your new setup i.e. when buying larger rims and low profile tires for your vehicle that maintain the same tire circumference.\r\n• Making sure that your speedometer will not need adjusting when you change tire and/or wheel size.\r\n• Helping you make an informed choice when buying new tires by explaining tire specifications and capability.\r\n• Getting a better understanding of your tire's specifications for correct use and care i.e. the max inflation pressure for your tires.\r\n• Converting units of measurement and tire pressure.\r\n\r\nIncrements & Accuracy \r\n• Tap the bottom bar buttons to choose alternative increments (e.g. 1 psi, 2, psi, 5 psi, 10 psi). \r\n• The table defaults to the largest increment available. \r\n\r\nSearch Function\r\n• Scroll up within a data table to reveal the search box.\r\n\r\nMore Units \r\n• Some tables have too many 'to' units to fit in the iPhone portrait position. Rotate your iPhone to the landscape position to show more conversion units (where available). \r\n\r\nBroad Categories\r\n• Choose New Tire Size - tables showing tire diameter, circumference and percentage difference between them.\r\n• Glossary - including Tire Sidewall Diagram\r\n• Detailed Tire Size Information - information from the tire code.\r\n• Load Index\r\n• Speed Rating\r\n• Load Range\r\n• Tire Pressure Unit Conversion\r\n• Measurement Unit Conversion\r\n\r\nSpecific Units Included \r\n• Millimeters, Inches\r\n• Pounds, Kilograms\r\n• Miles per Hour, Kilometers per Hour\r\n• Pounds per sq. Inch (psi), Kilopascals (kPa), Bar (bar), Kilogram per sq. cm (kg/cm²)\r\n\r\nUniversal App \r\nThis means you only need to buy it once to be able to install it on all your devices (iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad). \r\n\r\nIf you find this app useful, please leave a review on the App Store. \r\n\r\nIf you have suggestions, feature requests, or need support, feel free to contact us through the Settings menu within our apps."

The range of each species is described in detail (instead of range maps). In addition to the birds‘ geographical ranges, the altitudinal zones which they inhabit are given. The zones and their limits are:\n\n• Tropical Zone:\n  sea level to 4500–5000 ft (1,400 to 1,500 m)\n  \n• Subtropical Zone:\n  4500–5000 to 7500–8500 ft (1,400–1,500 m to 2,300–2,600 m)\n  \n• Temperate Zone:\n  7500–8500 to 9500–11,500 ft (2,300–2,600 m to 2,900–3,500 m)\n  \n• Páramo or Puna Zone:\n  9500–11,500 ft (2,900–3,500 m) to snow line \n\nThe current app version contains the descriptions and images of 1,703 bird species found in Peru. Moreover, an ornithological dictionary (English, French, Spanish, Portuguese) and detailed illustrations and drawings of bird anatomy are included.\n\nThe app features a modern, intuitive graphical user interface with functions for searching the birds‘ names and in the full text, switching the sorting language for the listings and sort by English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, or the scientific (Latin) notation. In addition to the bird descriptions, the name of the birds in many languages can be displayed.\n\nAnother clever feature is the Field Note Editor, which allows you to record your bird sightings with predefined locations settings (which can be overwritten by the user) and many other commonly recorded data items.\n\nApart from using the optional backup and restore functions for Field Notes and Favorites, the app runs completely offline and there is no need for an internet connection during usage in the field.\n\nAs with The Birds of South America, which contains more than 3,000 birds found on the entire continent, also The Birds of Peru runs on any iOS device and can exchange Field Notes and Favorites list between identical app versions on two or more devices via Bluetooth."

It is not cluttered with information about samples that rock hounds are not interested in. Who is looking for Allanite or Manganbabingtonite? \n\nFeatures of this App:\n   - View information and pictures of the most common collected rocks, gems, and minerals.\n\n   - Search by name and information to narrow your results to view.\n\n   - Add your own using pictures from your Photo Library. Enter name and description of your new addition and assign pictures from your Photo Library for the Icon and Pics pages. Once the pics are added from your Photo Library, they can be deleted, as the picture information is stored in the App.\n\n   - Tips section gives information about collecting as well as App specific information.\n\n   - Gallery section gives you the ability to showcase just the rocks you have. Organized by their pictures and sorted by their Name, Type, or Rating. Share them to others or save to your Photo Library.\n\n   - No internet connection needed. All data stored locally, so it is still usable in locations that may not be out of network range.\n\n    - No Ads or in-App purchases. Nothing else to buy.\n\nIf you have an iPhone, you may be interested in the app \"RockHound\", which contains GPS data of collection sites and what you will find there, along with this module for identification. The RockHound app will not work on the iPod Touch, since the GPS data is critical for its use."

      "label": "*** Planning to go bird watching in Ecuador? Then this is the app for you. This app fills a gap in the region and is the only app available for Ecuador! It is based on renowned reference work of the Helm Guide Series \"Birds of Northern South America\" by Robin Restall, Clemencia Rodner, and Miguel Lentino. The creation of apps from the book is a co-production between Bloomsbury Plc and Sunbird Images. The app contains 5,000 illustrations and more than 3,000 bird songs and calls in total.  \n\n>> Neotropical Birding Magazine writes:\n\n*** \"Condensing Restall’s two-volume work into an app, while remaining usable, is no mean feat - and Sunbird Images deserve recognition  for successfully doing so. Navigation is admirably straightforward.\" ***\n\n*** \"Two nice touches are displaying the sonogram in ‘real time’ with the vocalisation, and a ‘loop’ facility to make playback more manageable.\" ***\n\n*** \"The app is self-evidently the equal of Restall et al. as an identification tool, and a smartphone is so much more portable than a field guide. Moreover, the in-built vocalisations are arguably worth the purchase price alone...\" ***\n\n\nThis app is part of the Sunbird Images BLUE LABEL series. Our BLUE LABEL series are top notch digital field guides which provide the most comprehensive data available for a region or taxon. They stand for completeness including even the very rare species and vagrants which have only been recorded once or a few times in a region. Even the rare species are illustrated and described in detail featured with a full species account.\n\nNo other bird app for this region offers the following:\n\n- Includes all 1,612 Ecuadorian bird species including all vagrants\n- Selection of 5,000 illustrations from the reference work \"Birds of Northern South America\"\n- All subspecies + geographic, age and sex variations illustrated\n- 3,158 bird songs and calls\n- Most advanced Compare Mode of any bird app - compare up to 16 species images / songs / maps\n- Spectrograms of all songs + details where songs were recorded\n- Detailed distribution maps of Northern South America down to subspecies level\n- Introduction contains hints and links on bird watching in Ecuador\n- Create sighting lists and sort by place, date, group, and name\n- Automatically plots all birds on a map via GPS (editable)\n- Make notes for each bird spotted\n- A simple identification key narrows species down \n- Sort and display species: A–Z, 6 different languages, taxonomic\n\nEcuador is a prime birding spot and a country of extremes. It covers altitudes between coastal regions up to heights of more than 6,000 m and habitats that include coasts with beaches, Desert Woodland and Arid Scrub, Páramo, Temperate as well as Subtropical Montane Forest (Cloud Forest/ Elfin Woodland), the Amazon Rainforest in particular, Swamps and Mangroves. Ecuador has the largest biodiversity per square kilometre in the world, with an unlimited number of possibilities for birding. \n\nChoose between 6 bird name languages: \nEnglish, Latin, Spanish, French, Dutch, German\n\nNarrow species down by foot colour, bill shape, tail length etc. leading to the bird searched for plus a choice of similar species. You can also look for fragments of a species name – the search for “finch“ shows all the species which include the word “finch“ in the species’ name.\n\n***A graphically well-designed layout – easy to use with large lettering.*** \n\n\"All Birds Ecuador\" is very well suited for keeping personalised bird watch lists.\n\nThe app will be continuously developed further. All updates are free of charge. Once downloaded no internet connection needed – just download the app and start birding!\n\nVisit our internet support site for more information www.sunbird.tv. We are happy, if you like our app. Please don't hesitate to email us if you have any questions or suggestions or comments at: bnsa@sunbird.tv"

      "label": "Modern Military Vehicles is a mini encyclopedia of the most important and influential military vehicles that are currently used around the world.\n\nThis pocket compendium app contains over 300 vehicles and lets you explore at a glance:\n\n- the evolution of the main battle tank, from third generation (Leclerc, C1 Ariete, Challenger 2, M1 Abrams and T-80) to third generation advanced (Arjun, Karrar and VT4) and present day fourth generation vehicles (Altay, K2 Black Panther and Type 10),\n\n- the increased use of common platforms (the Russian Armata Universal Combat Platform, the American Stryker platform, the Italian Centauro/Freccia/SuperAV chassis and the South Korean K806/K808 design) or major modules (as is the case of the AS-90, K9 Thunder and AHS Krab or the OF-40, TAM and Palmaria) for multiple vehicles,\n\n- the continued refinement of older designs in order to improve firepower, protection and mobility (Leopard 2A4/A5/A6, Merkava II/III/IV, T-90 and M109A6 Paladin),\n\n- the introduction of advanced heavily armed remote weapon stations, unmanned turrets (T-14/15 Armata, M1128 MGS) and unmanned combat vehicles (Uran-9),\n\n- the diminishing presence of light tanks (like the American Stingray, the Swedish Ikv 91 or the Chinese ZTD-05) on the battlefield,\n\n- the large variety in concepts for infantry fighting vehicles: traditional tracked designs (Ajax, BMD-4, CV90, Dardo, K21, Lynx, Puma, Tulpar, Type 89 or Ulan/Pizarro), multipurpose wheeled vehicles (Boxer, Lazar 2, Fuchs 1/2, Pandur I/II, Patria AMV, Piranha III, VBCI), heavy armoured personnel carriers (including the Achzarit, Namer and BMO-T), mine resistant ambush protected vehicles (the American Cougar or Russian Typhoon series) and infantry support vehicles (BMPT Terminator and Nagmachon),\n\n- the different approaches to tank destroyers: tracked (2S25 Sprut-SD) or wheeled (Rooikat), armed with guns (Type 16 MCV) or anti-tank guided missiles (AFT-10), \n\n- the development of more accurate and mobile self-propelled artillery systems, from the massive tracked 2S19 Msta-S, 2S35 Koalitsiya-SV and PzH 2000 to the more mobile 2S23 Nona-SVK, ATMOS 2000 and G6 Rhino wheeled vehicles and the less expensive Archer, CAESAR, K239 Chunmoo and RM-70 Vampir truck-based howitzers and multiple rocket launchers,\n\n- the advancements in anti-aircraft systems, including self-propelled guns (Lvkv 90, PZA Loara, Type 87), surface-to-air missile platforms (9K37 Buk, S-400 Triumf) and combinations of both (Pantsir-S1, PGZ-09),\n\n- the use of highly specialized engineer vehicles (BAT-2, Trojan AVRE, UR-77 Meteorit, M1150 ABV), bridgelayers (Titan AVLB) and armoured recovery vehicles (BREM-1, CRARRV, Type 90 ARV),\n\n- the large array of purpose-built military light vehicles, from special forces vehicles (like the Desert Patrol Vehicle or the RSOV), tank transporters (M1070 HET or Scammell Commander), trucks (FMTV, KamAZ-4310, MTVR), utility vehicles (GAZ Tigr, Iveco LMV, URO VAMTAC) and special carriers (DT-30P Vityaz).\n\nEach vehicle entry contains at least one image, a short text that summarises the vehicle's development and service history and a detailed specifications table offering place of origin and production information, crew, weight and dimensions data, armour and armament details, powerplant and performance figures.\n\nIf you have a question, a suggestion or a comment, you can contact me here:\n- instagram.com/AlexAngelescuApps\n- facebook.com/AlexandruAngelescuApps\n- youtube.com/AlexandruAngelescu\n- twitter.com/AlxAngApps"

All the audio is embedded in the software, so you can listen to the Holy Bible at any time, without the need for a wireless connection.\n\nThe audio is the recording of a real person reading carefully and slowly in an American-midwest accent without background music or dramatic effect which many find distracting. If you find it too fast or slow for your preference, you can adjust the reading speed while still maintaining the natural voice sound. You can hear a sample of the actual audio by going to this URL in your browser:\nhttp://www.audiotreasure.com/KJV/40_Matthew/Matthew.m3u\n\nThe program remembers the audio position so you can start listening where you last left off. The audio will keep playing even after the screen is locked so you can save battery power while continuing to listen.\n\nThe program is simple to use\n- Touch the book icon to select the Book/Chapter to start at\n- You can fast forward, rewind, pause, and skip forward and back chapters.\n- Read along scripture text in synch with the audio\n- Navigate by Book, chapter and verse\n- Sleep timer\n- Repeat playback between books/chapters/verses\n- Change audio speed to suit your taste without affecting the voice sound."

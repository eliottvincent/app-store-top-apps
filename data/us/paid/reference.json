      "label": "Find the right word wherever you go. The official RhymeZone iOS app is a fast, powerful rhyming dictionary and thesaurus that you can use anywhere, even if you're not on the net. Quickly find rhymes, near rhymes (including slant rhymes), synonyms, antonyms, homophones, similar sounding words, words with the same consonant pattern, and other related words (generalizations, specializations, words appearing in the same context). Use Apple's local dictionaries or ours online if you are unsure of any meanings.\n\nYou get a database of over 150,000 words and phrases right at your fingertips. Find rhymes without an Internet connection, but if you are online, we'll connect you to RhymeZone.com for definitions and all the other great features you've come to love, ad-free! Or you can look it up on our sister site, OneLook.com, or even hear it pronounced with your device's built-in text-to-speech.\n\nThere's also a nifty \"Poet Maker\" feature, which lets you find words that match constraints on both rhyme and meaning at the same time. For example, suppose you want a word that rhymes with \"cat\" and means \"heavy\"; this feature will answer \"fat\" in no time. Or suppose you're looking for a rhyme of \"curious\" that means \"invalid\"; you'll get \"spurious\". You get the idea!\n\nSo whether you're aspiring to be the next Shakespeare, looking to put on the finishing touches of a love poem, bust out the next rap lyric, or just seeking some clever wordplay for your English assignment, give the app a try!"

After initiating SkyCast, you can generate a link and conveniently share it with other SkySafari users via text message, apps or social media accounts.\n\n+ Sky Tonight -  jump to the new Tonight section to see what’s visible in your sky tonight.  Expanded information has been designed to help plan your night and includes  Moon & Sun info, calendar curations, events and the best positioned deep sky and solar system objects.\n\n+ Improved Observation Tools - SkySafari is the perfect tool to help you plan, record and organize your observations.  New workflows make it easier to add, search, filter and sort data.\n\n+ Home Screen and Lock Screen Widgets  keep your favorite astro information at your fingertips.\n\nThe Small Touches:\n\n+ You can now edit the Jupiter GRS Longitude Value in the Settings.\n+ Better Moon Age calculation.\n+ New grid & reference options allow you to display Solstice and Equinox markers, Orbit + Node markers for all solar system objects, and tick marks and labels for the Ecliptic, Meridian, and Equator reference lines.\n+ Previous In-app Purchases are Now Free -  this includes the H-R diagram, 3D Galaxy view, and the PGC galaxy and GAIA star catalogs. Enjoy.\n+ Many more.\n\nIf you haven't used SkySafari 7 Pro before, here's what you can do with it:\n\n+ Hold your device up, and SkySafari 7 Pro will find stars, constellations, planets, and more! The star chart updates automatically with your movements for the ultimate stargazing experience.\n\n+ Simulate the night sky up to 100,000 years in the past or future! Animate meteor showers, conjunctions, eclipses, and other celestial events.\n\n+ Control your telescope, log and plan your observations.\n\n+ Optionally backup all of your observing data in our secure cloud storage and make it easily accessible to multiple devices as well as from our new web interface, LiveSky.com.\n\n+ Augmented Reality (AR) mode\n\n+ Night Vision.\n\n+ Orbit Mode.

It is an invaluable resource written when American values and patriotism were based on Christian values.\n\nOf interest to poets and writers, The Noah Webster dictionary was used extensively by Emily Dickinson. We know that she made frequent and extensive use of Noah Webster's American Dictionary of the English Language in writing her poems, paying attention not only to the definitions but also to Webster's etymologies and his illustrative quotations.\n\nBeing able to see how definitions have evolved today is fascinating, and a great resource when studying.\n\nYou can easily search or browse the entire dictionary and add favourites to revisit later.\n\nApp design by professional app developer NASDA Studios."

It allows sorting by distance or by Trustee callsign as well as filtering by band and radius in miles or kilometers.\n\nNOW RFinder Routing is integrated with RT Systems radio programmers! Your subscription bought here by installing this app gives you access in RT...just make sure RT is updated to the latest version by pressing Help-Update. Click File-External Data->RFinder Web Search and click Route! Easy as pie to program your radio now for a trip you are taking with just a few easy clicks...check out the tutorial video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaeRzcnNNdQ\n\nNOW INCLUDES SOCIAL FUNCTIONS!!!! In the repeater detail screen, click the Check In button. All users will see that you are on that machine! This can be used to find your friends or a machine with a user on it. In the settings bundle app/RFinder you can turn on APRS posting. This posts your current position with the repeater you are checked into. You can also let your friends on Facebook® know what repeater you are on as well as your Twitter® followers, when checking in.\n\nNOW INTEGRATED WITH THE EchoLink APP!!\nFrom the repeater detail screen, any repeater that has an Echolink node attached just touch the number and if you have the EchoLink app installed it will launch to that node automatically for you.\n\nOur repeater locator database is growing daily.\nAccess to the Directory is included for one year then it will be an annual subscription for $9.99, and your subscription works for all platforms.... Each purchase of a new platform advances your annual to a year from that new purchase date. Sub\n\nIf we do not have your repeaters listed...please do not refund or give us a bad rating...add repeaters at http://add.rfinder.net or request an add or update from the app.. Don't forget LAT/LON (in decimal), use periods as decimals, please.\n\nThe application accesses our Worldwide Repeater Directory and scanner directory for Amateur Radio (Ham Radio) but only stores information for repeaters within approximately 80 miles (125 km) from your location on your handheld at any one time, saving you room on your device and allowing distance calculation and mapping features to operate smoothly. It uses geolocation either via cell tower triangulation, GPS or manual location entry (so you can look up the repeaters you will use on vacation or business trips, etc.).\n\nIf anyone has lists of Amateur Radio repeaters from their countries we would love to incorporate that into our database.\n\nWorldwide IRLP and Echolink nodes.\n\n© ITWeRKS 2011"

Consequently, they play significant roles in the landscape, in the ecology of our land, in forestry, in apiculture and in horticulture.\n\nEUCLID provides complete descriptions of 934 species and subspecies of Angophora, Corymbia and Eucalyptus plus an interactive identification key using Lucid software. It covers all Australian States and Territories. Over twelve thousand images are used to assist interpretation of species features and the species themselves as well as their geographic distribution. \n\nThis innovative application makes identification a breeze. The process begins by choosing from simple characteristics of the eucalypt you are trying to identify. For example, answer questions such does it have rough or smooth bark, leaf shapes and flower types. If you’re not sure what to look at next the Lucid application can even recommend features to guide you through to the fastest identification possible. EUCLID is a treasure-trove of information. The application brings together beautifully illustrated features states to help visualise your choices as well as fact sheets and images of every species – all at your fingertips. \n\nThe App edition of EUCLID still functions without an internet connection, making it especially valuable for people working in the field."

      "label": "SkySafari 6 Pro will revolutionize your astronomical viewing experience.  It has the largest database of any astronomy app, includes every solar system object ever discovered, offers unparalleled accuracy, flawless telescope control, Augmented Reality (AR) mode, and provides the very best experience under the stars when you depend on it. Discover why SkySafari 6 Pro is the #1 recommended astronomy app for serious amateur astronomers since 2009.\n\nHere's what's new in version 6:\n\n1) Complete support for iOS 13 and iPhone 11. We release regular updates.\n\n2) Clouds and Astronomy. Two words that rarely go together. SkySafari 6 Pro will (optionally) back up all of your observing data in our secure cloud storage and make it easily accessible to multiple devices as well as from our new web interface, LiveSky.com.\n\n3) We Have The Best Stars. Precise, modern and deep. We’ve updated our star catalog to use the latest and greatest, UCAC5 star catalog. If 25 million stars down to 15th magnitude isn’t enough for you, an easy in-app purchase gets you down to 16.5 magnitude and a whopping 100 million stars!\n\n4) We Have The Best Galaxies. The PGC catalog includes galaxies down to 18th magnitude. Want more galaxies? How about 2.6 million more? An in-app purchase gives you access to the largest galaxy database available for your device.\n\n5) Observers First. A redesign of our tools puts the active observer first. Quick access to features like your equipment, observing sites, lists, and observations make it easy and enjoyable to get out, observe, and record your observations. The observing sessions feature lets you collect your observations into groups that span a few hours, or a few nights.\n\n6) Graph It. The completely new graph tool will give a quick visual representation of an object’s altitude above the horizon. Essential for planning your night’s observations.\n\n7) Plan It. Make the most of your time under the stars. Our updated planner is a powerful tool that lets you create a list of targets for your observing session with filters like object types, specific time ranges, constellation, catalog, and more. Plan it and get more done.\n\n8) Say It. Ever just wanted to just yell at your device and tell it what to do!? SkySafari 6 adds basic voice control for a wide range of operations. Say “select Jupiter,” “search for Titan,” “center on Polaris” and SkySafari will do the work for you. Yelling optional. \n\n9) Tilt It. Every old astronomy app these days lets your tilt and pan your device to show different parts of the sky, but who else lets you control your telescope that way!? “Tilt to slew” is an optional mode allowing you to keep your eye in the eyepiece, and, using the accelerometers in your device, gently translate the movements of your hands into smooth telescope motion.\n\n10) Share It. SkySafari 6 is more than just a mobile app, it’s a new system to help organize and share your observing experiences. With a free signup, you can see and share your observing data from our web portal, LiveSky.com! Affordable premium memberships add online editing, so you can not only view, but edit your observations, add new observing sites, manage your equipment and more. Finally, (coming soon) you can view, edit and manage your settings files with SkySafari Web, our fully functional web version.\n\nIf you haven't used SkySafari 6 Pro before, here's what you can do with it:\n\n• Hold your device up, and SkySafari 6 Pro will find stars, constellations, planets, and more! The star chart updates automatically with your movements for the ultimate stargazing experience.\n\n• Simulate the night sky up to 10,000 years in the past or future! Animate meteor showers, conjunctions, eclipses, and other celestial events.\n\n• Control your telescope, log and plan your observations.\n\n• Night Vision.\n\n• Orbit Mode. Leave the Earth’s surface behind, and fly through our solar system.\n\n• Galaxy View shows the position of deep sky objects in our Milky Way!\n\n• Much more!"

      "label": "The Hebrew Bible iPhone application is designed for reading/studying the Hebrew Bible in either Hebrew, Aramaic (Torah only), or in a parallel translation format combining Hebrew and another language (at present, either English or French). It is also useful as a tool for improving one's knowledge of Biblical Hebrew and Biblical Aramaic. It is comprised of five main components:\n\n1. Bible: The Hebrew Bible is accessible in several different versions (a default version is selected via iPhone preferences and it is possible to change versions while running the application as well). The first six versions listed below are included in the App, the other versions can be either accessed over the Internet or downloaded (at no additional charge). The versions that are available are: \n    * Hebrew (cantillation)\n    * Hebrew (vowels)\n    * Hebrew (no vowels)\n    * Hebrew/English (cantillation)\n    * Hebrew/English (vowels)\n    * Hebrew/English (no vowels)\n    * Hebrew/French\n    * English\n    * Hebrew Torah (commentary)\n    * Aramaic Torah (vowels)\n    * Aramaic Torah (no vowels)\n\nWhen reading a book or chapter (regardless of the version selected), it is also possible to listen to the Hebrew version of the selected book/chapter being read by pressing the \"Play\" button at the top of the page. The audio readings are pronounced in Sephardi-style Hebrew. In additon to a \"Book\"-based reading approach, it is possible to also toggle to a \"Parashah\"-based approach (a Parashah is the weekly synagogue Torah/Haftarah reading). Both Ashkenazi and Sephardi Parashah readings are supported. While reading the Hebrew and Hebrew/English versions, if you touch any Hebrew word, you will be presented with a pop-up English definition. From the popup, it is also possible to display a list of all the verses in the Hebrew Bible that contain that word. \n\n2. Words: This is useful for learning more about specific Hebrew words and for discovering related words. One can lookup words by \"Root\" by selecting the first two letters of the Hebrew word root. A listing will be displayed of all Hebrew words (and, optionally, Aramaic words and/or proper names) that begin with those two letters. Once the list is displayed, touching a word will open up a further level of detail about the selected word (and, optionally, all verses that contain that word or the BDB page for that word). Alternatively, one can use the \"Translate\" function to translate words or sentences or go directly to the word detail via the \"Strongs\" number lookup function. There is also a word search facility.\n\n3. Topics: There are links to key topics (over 200 people/places/things) in the Wikipedia online encyclopedia. One can access topics by Bible book, by \"Meta\" topics, and a consolidated list of all topics.\n\n4. Maps: There are maps of almost every location (over 1,000 locations) mentioned in the Hebrew Bible. It is possible to display multiple different locations on a map and to clear previously selected locations from a map. One can access Maps by Bible book or a consolidated list of all maps. By selecting a location on the map and touching the \"callout detail disclosure\" symbol (the \"right arrow\"), one can see a listing of all verses in the Hebrew Bible that mention that location.\n\n5. BDB: The Brown–Driver–Briggs Hebrew Lexicon is probably the most commonly used Biblical Hebrew Lexicon. A complete copy of this lexicon is accessible from within the application. In additon, individual pages  can be displayed via the word lookup functionality.\n\nAn Internet connection is required in order to use some content in this application but most core functionality is maintained locally."

Search for answers in HSVG, a massive & constantly growing database of equine health info – conveniently available to you “horse side.” \n\nHSVG was created by Doug Thal DVM DABVP, a lifelong horseman & veterinarian that has practiced exclusively equine veterinary medicine for over 20 years & is board certified in equine practice.  \n\nHSVG provides helpful information about equine health from the moment you notice a problem with your horse - My Observation.  It contains practical advice, suggested skills, and questions to discuss with your vet.\n\nHSVG is of value in an emergency and non-emergency, and it helps you distinguish between the two. HSVG also contains dozens of high quality instructional videos, and other media designed to enable you to become an active participant in ensuring your horse’s good health.  \n\nHowever, HSVG is not structured as a simple decision tree that takes you down a singular path based on your input. It is not a substitute for your local equine veterinarian. It does not, and cannot, anticipate and address all of the subtle variations and unique circumstances associated with your horse’s health. That is your veterinarian's job.\n__________________________\n\n- Make better decisions about your horse’s health.\n- Increase the quality of communication between you and your vet.\n- Follow a logical thought process for addressing any equine heath care problem.\n- Utilize a quality alternative to Dr. Google.\n\nOk – so what is Horse Side Vet Guide exactly? \n\nHSVG is a custom-built relational database of equine health information that contains concise information about common problems to rare diseases.  Records are contained in 1 of 9 categories:\n\n- My Observations\n- Vet Diagnostics\n- Vet Diagnoses\n- Vet Treatments\n- My Skills\n- My Supplies\n- Terms & Topics\n- Media\n- Outside Resources\n\nThese records are extensively interlinked, providing a uniquely contextualized approach to any equine health issue. \n\nWe continuously add and update the records in HSVG. We have placed great emphasis on completing the MY OBSERVATIONS records first. You can find \"full access\" records with a keyword search, in the alphabetical browse lists, and hyperlinked inside other records. Incomplete (or \"partial access\") records are listed inside full access records, with no hyperlink. Many other records are hidden from view, and will be available later. After we complete a partial or hidden record we change it to \"full access\" and it becomes immediately available to you after the app has been synchronized to your mobile device. \n\nPlease see our website www.horsesidevetguide.com for more information about this application."

No internet connection needed, so it can be in your pocket as you travel through Maya ruins and use it to calculate the Gregorian calendar dates from Maya long counts on monuments.\n\nMaya Calendar gives you the Maya calendar date for today or any date in history – past, present, and future.  Convert dates back and forth between the Maya and Gregorian calendars, learn about the various Maya cycles of time, and gain a better understanding of why December 21, 2012 A.D. is an important Maya date.\n\nIn addition, this app can calculate your birthday in the Maya sacred calendar and learn what it says about your personality traits and destiny.\n\nMaya Calendar offers these great features:\n\n– The Home Page displays the current day in the Maya Calendar, both in hieroglyphs and in modern text formats.\n\n– “This Day in Maya History” cites a major event in Maya history for almost every day of the year.\n\n–  The “Maya Calendars” section provides a detailed explanation of each of the major Maya calendrical cycles, a discussion of the calendar correlation debate, and the thinking behind the possible end date of 2012 A.D.\n\n– The “Calculator” allows you to convert any Gregorian date into its Maya calendar equivalent.\n\n– The “Long Count” feature allows you to convert any Maya Long Count date into its Gregorian calendar equivalent. \n\n– The “Birthdays” feature allows you to calculate and store the Maya birthdays of everyone you know. Once calculated, the app provides a host of information about that individual: personality traits; animal, color, and directional associations; and events in Maya history that occurred on the same date as their birth.\n\n– The “Known Birthdays” feature lists and saves the names of everyone whose Maya birthday you have recorded and notifies you when their birthday comes around.\n\n– “What to Do Today” lists the activities that modern Maya calendar priests recommend for any given day.\n\nMaya Calendar, created by Dr. Ed Barnhart, is an invaluable tool for students investigating Maya inscriptions, and for anyone fascinated with the workings of the Maya calendar."

This app ships with preloaded data for the 117th Congress, First Session (January, 2021).  If you'd like additional updates throughout the year, you can get them through an in-app purchase.\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nNo matter who you support, you can have every member of Congress in YOUR pocket or on your iPad.

Learn all about who represents you in Congress, contact them in Washington, follow their campaigns and challengers, read their Facebook and Twitter pages, and see their YouTube videos.  Share any link in the application via email, Facebook, or Twitter.\n\nWhile this will be enough for most people, if you need over-the-air updates, separate sections for lists of committees and subcommittees, and well as the ability to share notes with your team, please consider our app CongressPro on the App Store.  Congress+ is updated every few months during the session, usually with new content.\n\nRemember, they work on Capitol Hill but they work for you.\n\nREVIEWS\n\nOur congressional apps have been featured by Apple ten times as a New and Noteworthy application, a Staff Favorite, America the Beautiful and in special Campaign sections.\n\nHere's what others have to say:\n\n• Macworld, \"Indispensable\"\n• POLITICO, \"An iPhone Fav\"\n• Washingtonian, \"Top iPhone Apps for Washington\"\n• PBS: Leading App for Following Congress\n• Federal News Radio \"Anything you need at your fingertips.\"\n• Featured by Huffington Post AND RedState\n• Oh, My, Gov! \"#1 iPhone App for Government\"\n• Mashable, \"Top 5 Best Apps for Political Junkies\"\n• BlogCritics, \"Top 10 iPhone Application\"\n• AppCraver.com, “Editor’s Pick\"\n• What’sOnIPhone, “Something every citizen should have”\n\nWHAT'S INCLUDED\n\nBasic information\nMember of Congress's first and last name; title or leadership position, state, senior/junior designation in the Senate and District number in the house, political party affiliation, district map, office maps, and biographical information.\n\nContact information\nWashington, DC office address, map, official website link, member contact form, and telephone number.

Gonzalez, and Sabato's Crystal Ball.\n\nBonus features\nLocate your members of Congress over-the-air, learn who to contact to register to vote in your state, news, link to the White House website, Campaign Finance, Legislation, Transparency, our Twitter page, and answers to frequently-asked questions. \n\nProblems with this update?\nIf you have a problem with the update, please delete the app and reinstall it.  You can also email us directly at update@congressinyourpocket.com. We respond to every single one. Bad reviews don't help you get your app working. We will.\n\nHow often is the information updated?\nThe data in this application is current to early January 2021, the first session of 117th Congress (2021).

With NeuBible's spine navigation, it's always easy to remember where you are and what you were doing. Plus, it's always within a thumb's reach, and even easy to use with the larger screens of the iPhone 6 & 6 Plus!\n\n• A beautiful, considered reading experience — We've licensed fonts from Hoefler & Co, Linotype, Commercial Type & DSType, and hand-tuned the margins, line spacing and font sizes to give you as considered a reading experience as you'll find anywhere on iOS.\n\n• Lightweight...AND LIGHTNING FAST — From its insanely quick loading speed, to its inventive use of navigation, everything about NeuBible has been optimized and engineered to get you to books and verses, and get reading as quickly as possible.\n\n• Quick Search — Double tap anywhere while reading to quickly access search and easily find books, keywords, and even jump directly to verses.\n\n• Timeline View — Quickly access your highlighted verses, along with any verse(s) you've bookmarked.\n\n• Easy chapter navigation — Swipe left in the book view or while reading to quickly navigate to other chapters.\n\n• Reading mode customization — Customize your reading experience with control of font formatting and day & night reading modes.\n\n• Reading Reminders — No unwanted push notifications here, just the ones you set yourself.\n\n• Gesture-based verse highlighting — Simply tap, hold, and drag your finger down the screen to highlight and copy verses.\n\n• Make NeuBible your own w/ themes — Since the Bible is one of the most personal reading experiences you'll ever have, we wanted to help you make it feel even more personal. Themes are basically like going to the bookstore and picking out that ONE perfect Bible for yourself when you were a kid...\n\n• iCloud Sync — Keep all of your highlights* and timeline backed up and synced across devices seamlessly with iCloud Sync\n\n*We currently only support iCloud sync for highlights at this time. We've put a lot of thought into this and feel that even though it would be easy to do, given the different places and ways most people use their iPhones and iPads, also syncing reading position and bookmark wouldn't provide the best user experience.\n\n-----------\n\nAVAILABLE TRANSLATIONS\n\n• English Standard Version (ESV)*\n• Holman Christian Standard Bible (HCSB)\n• World English Bible (WEB)\n• American Standard Version (ASV)\n• King James Version (KJV)\n• Common English Bible (CEB)*\n• New American Standard Bible (NASB)*\n• New International Version (NIV)*\n• New King James Version (NKJV)*\n\n*Available via in-app purchase\n\n-----------\n\n\nIf you'd like to find out more about the translation licensing process, ask us a question about the ones that are currently available, or send us a request for your favorite translation, you contact us at http://www.neubible.co, on Facebook, or on Twitter at @neubibleco"

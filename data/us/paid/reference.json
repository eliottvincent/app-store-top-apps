Quickly find rhymes, near rhymes (including slant rhymes), synonyms, antonyms, homophones, similar sounding words, words with the same consonant pattern, and other related words (generalizations, specializations, words appearing in the same context). Use Apple's local dictionaries or ours online if you are unsure of any meanings.\n\nYou get a database of over 150,000 words and phrases right at your fingertips. Find rhymes without an Internet connection, but if you are online, we'll connect you to RhymeZone.com for definitions and all the other great features you've come to love, ad-free! Or you can look it up on our sister site, OneLook.com, or even hear it pronounced with your device's built-in text-to-speech.\n\nThere's also a nifty \"Poet Maker\" feature, which lets you find words that match constraints on both rhyme and meaning at the same time. For example, suppose you want a word that rhymes with \"cat\" and means \"heavy\"; this feature will answer \"fat\" in no time. Or suppose you're looking for a rhyme of \"curious\" that means \"invalid\"; you'll get \"spurious\". You get the idea!\n\nSo whether you're aspiring to be the next Shakespeare, looking to put on the finishing touches of a love poem, bust out the next rap lyric, or just seeking some clever wordplay for your English assignment, give the app a try!"

It is an invaluable resource written when American values and patriotism were based on Christian values.\n\nOf interest to poets and writers, The Noah Webster dictionary was used extensively by Emily Dickinson. We know that she made frequent and extensive use of Noah Webster's American Dictionary of the English Language in writing her poems, paying attention not only to the definitions but also to Webster's etymologies and his illustrative quotations.\n\nBeing able to see how definitions have evolved today is fascinating, and a great resource when studying.\n\nYou can easily search or browse the entire dictionary and add favourites to revisit later.\n\nApp design by professional app developer NASDA Studios."

Search for answers in HSVG, a massive & constantly growing database of equine health info – conveniently available to you “horse side.” \n\nHSVG was created by Doug Thal DVM DABVP, a lifelong horseman & veterinarian that has practiced exclusively equine veterinary medicine for over 20 years & is board certified in equine practice.  \n\nHSVG provides helpful information about equine health from the moment you notice a problem with your horse - My Observation.  It contains practical advice, suggested skills, and questions to discuss with your vet.\n\nHSVG is of value in an emergency and non-emergency, and it helps you distinguish between the two. HSVG also contains dozens of high quality instructional videos, and other media designed to enable you to become an active participant in ensuring your horse’s good health.  \n\nHowever, HSVG is not structured as a simple decision tree that takes you down a singular path based on your input. It is not a substitute for your local equine veterinarian. It does not, and cannot, anticipate and address all of the subtle variations and unique circumstances associated with your horse’s health. That is your veterinarian's job.\n__________________________\n\n- Make better decisions about your horse’s health.\n- Increase the quality of communication between you and your vet.\n- Follow a logical thought process for addressing any equine heath care problem.\n- Utilize a quality alternative to Dr. Google.\n\nOk – so what is Horse Side Vet Guide exactly? \n\nHSVG is a custom-built relational database of equine health information that contains concise information about common problems to rare diseases.  Records are contained in 1 of 9 categories:\n\n- My Observations\n- Vet Diagnostics\n- Vet Diagnoses\n- Vet Treatments\n- My Skills\n- My Supplies\n- Terms & Topics\n- Media\n- Outside Resources\n\nThese records are extensively interlinked, providing a uniquely contextualized approach to any equine health issue. \n\nWe continuously add and update the records in HSVG. We have placed great emphasis on completing the MY OBSERVATIONS records first. You can find \"full access\" records with a keyword search, in the alphabetical browse lists, and hyperlinked inside other records. Incomplete (or \"partial access\") records are listed inside full access records, with no hyperlink. Many other records are hidden from view, and will be available later. After we complete a partial or hidden record we change it to \"full access\" and it becomes immediately available to you after the app has been synchronized to your mobile device. \n\nPlease see our website www.horsesidevetguide.com for more information about this application."

      "label": "There’s something about knowing what creatures sniffed your tent in the night or walked along the path ahead of you. And yet, so often those signs are a mystery to us.\n\nWell they needn’t be. iTrack Southern Africa is an easy-to-use digital field guide that takes our communal knowledge of Southern African mammal tracks to another level altogether. It is accessible enough for those outdoor enthusiasts with nothing more than a casual interest in the footprints they come across and yet contains enough accurate and quantifiable information to be a powerful tool for hunters, researchers and expert trackers.\n\nIt breaks new ground in documenting the commonly used gait patterns of many Southern African mammals and makes use of over 2000 measurements to bring users never before published detail on track dimensions.\n\nSome of the key features of this app include:\n• Track and sign information for 61 Southern African mammal species (this number will continue to be added to in future updates).\n• Over 650 high quality track, sign, and animal photos with captions that point out key identification features.\n• Scale bars with precise measurements next to many track and sign photos.\n• Hoof, paw or foot photographs for a number species.\n• Photographs of commonly used gait patterns.\n• Detailed descriptions for both front and hind tracks.\n• Accurate track measurements for a number of track dimensions including, for certain species, claws lengths and intermediate pad widths.\n• Detailed dung, gait, and similar species descriptions.\n• A beautiful, easy to use interface.\n• The ability to zoom, pinch, and swipe between photos.\n• Wikipedia pages for each species - stored in the app to allow viewing with no internet connection.\n• Information sections including how to measure tracks, basic track anatomy, gait patterns and trailing animals, including a novel section on the psychology behind tracking and how to focus your thinking to maximize your chances of successfully tracking down an animal.\n\niTrack Southern Africa, goes far beyond what a traditional field guide can offer with a powerful search tool developed by Jonah to simplify track identification in the field. It makes use of basic track features, length and width measurements and your locality to narrow down the options. If you’re not sure what criteria to choose, just leave it out and the tool will still provide you with a list of possibilities based on the information you have given it. \n\nSearch by the following criteria:\n• Common/Latin name\n• Track size\n• The number of toes\n• Toe shape\n• Presence or absence of claws\n• Mammal group\n• Location by Southern African country\n\niTrack Southern Africa is a collaborative effort between Dave Hood, a South African Field Guide and Naturalist with a passion for tracking who provided the bulk of the content and Jonah Evans – a wildlife biologist, the Texan State Mammologist and a CyberTracker track and sign specialist and evaluator. Jonah is also the producer of iTrack Wildlife – the definitive North American digital mammal track guide. The app uses Louis Liebenberg’s drawings which are considered to be the most accurate depictions of Southern African animal tracks. \n\nSpecies List:\n\nAardvark\nAardwolf\nAfrican (Cape) Buffalo\nAfrican Civet\nAfrican (Cape) Clawless Otter\nAfrican (Bush) Elephant\nAfrican Wild Cat\nAfrican Wild Dog\nBat-eared Fox\nBlack Rhino\nBlack Wildebeest\nBlack-backed Jackal\nBlesbok\nBlue Wildebeest\nBontebok\nBushbuck\nCape Ground Squirrel\nCape Grysbok\nChacma Baboon\nCheetah\nCommon Duiker\nCommon Waterbuck\nDomestic Cat\nDomestic Cow\nDomestic Dog\nDomestic Sheep\nEland\nGemsbok\nGenets\nGiraffe\nGreater Kudu\nHares\nHippopotamus\nHoney Badger\nHorse\nImpala\nLeopard\nLion\nMountain Reedbuck\nNyala\nOribi\nPorcupine\nRed Hartebeest\nRed Lechwe\nRock Hyrax\nSable Antelope\nSouthern African Hedgehog\nSouthern Reedbuck\nSpotted Hyaena\nSpringbok\nSpringhare\nSteenbok\nStriped Polecat\nSuricate\nTsessebe\nVervet Monkey\nWarthog\nWater (Marsh) Mongoose\nWhite Rhinoceros\nYellow Mongoose\nZebras"

      "label": "The IAP Bushings & Tubes app provides a searchable and sortable interface to over 4000 pen kits from most of the major kit suppliers. The app displays detailed tube and bushing specifications and drill bit requirements for every kit in the app database. These kit details can be emailed or printed via Air Print. You can create a favorites list of your most frequently used kits for faster access to those kits rather than searching through the entire app database every time you need to reference those kits. You can also reorder the database by your preferred supplier order.\n\nThe app also includes a drill bit converter for converting between inch fractional, inch decimal, metric and gauge drill sizes. Conversions to inch fractional are made to the nearest 1/64\" and conversions to gauge drill size are made to the nearest gauge drill size (107-1 and A-Z). An error factor is displayed for inexact conversions to inch fractional and gauge drill size.\n\nA 30-digit, 4-function calculator is included in the app. It has several advanced features not found in many simple calculators including a memory cell and the ability to display data in decimal or scientific notation.\n\nPhotos, Instructions and Bushing Drawings are available for most of the kits. When instructions or bushings are available, they may be viewed, mailed or printed.\n\nThe app also contains several lists of useful references: Worldwide Suppliers of pen kits with links to take you directly to their web site; Helpful Penturning videos with links that will take you directly to the video; and Penturning Tutorials with links that will download the tutorial to your device for viewing in the app or to email or print.\n\nThe app will automatically download database updates and the kit reference files from the IAP server."

Sort by song style to compare birds that hoot and coo, with birds with high pitched songs, or you might like to sort the birds by commonness, so you can listen to the most common ones first, then move on to less frequent backyard visitors. More advanced birders may like to listen to birds from a particular habitat, such as forest or freshwater for example. You can make lists of your favourites so that you can find them quickly.\n\nUse the quiz to test your memory. Answer fast to earn a score multiplier and get on the high score table. Experienced birders can use the custom quiz to help distinguish and learn similar songs. \n\nAnd when you need a rest, try the slideshow feature - choose which birds to include, maybe add background bird song, then simply relax. If you want to continue learning while you relax, switch the voiceover on and hear the name of the bird announced at the end of each clip. This is also a good way of competing with the family - who can say the name of the bird first?\n\nBird names are included in Spanish and French.\n\nProblems? Email us: spiny@spinysoftware.com"

Many species are represented with multiple call examples showing the full range of vocalizations.\n● The ability to compare any two images, maps, or sounds, side by side on the screen. The ability to filter by geographic location, so that you see only the species likely to occur in your location, and to further reduce the possibilities to usual or vagrant species in the selected area.\n● A “Smart Search” that gives the ability to search by distinguishing features such as size, colour, physical features, habitat and exclude certain types of birds (eg. Passerines).\n● A basic personal species list that stores your sightings saved to the device* (ability to upload list coming soon)\n● A comprehensive help and introduction section to help you if you get stuck or don’t understand how a certain feature works.\n\n*Uninstalling/reinstalling the program will result in the loss of your list, it is recommended that you keep your own backup (master list) separate from the application.\n\nWe invite all users to share their comments and ideas on our forum at www.mydigitalearth.com \n\nNB. This Application WILL ONLY work on an iPhone or iPod Touch running iOS V7.1 or higher NOT A NORMAL IPOD CLASSIC/NANO and the download is about 320MB."

      "label": "Imagine sharing the same devotional with 1.5 million believers in more than 50 languages around the globe. The Moravian Daily Texts has been living this ecumenical dream for many years!\n\nFirst published in 1731 in Saxony, the Daily Texts grew out of a spiritual renewal of the Moravian Church (Unitas Fratrum) that dates back to August 13, 1727. Today, more than 280 years after its first publication, the Daily Texts continues its promise of “a daily message from God that is new every morning.” \n\nThe Moravian Daily Texts offers an inspirational connection to the Holy Scriptures every day. Each entry in this beloved daily devotional includes “watchwords”—Old and New Testament verses to accompany readers throughout the day—combined with heartfelt prayers written by Moravian Church pastors and members from across North America.\n\nEach day, the Daily Texts app offers these verses and prayers, along with links to the full Bible verses in context (note: web access is required for this feature). In addition, the Daily Texts app includes a plan that guides readers through the Psalms in one year and the Old and New Testaments in two years.\n\nFeatures in this app include:\n- Text-to-speech capability, allowing users to hear the Daily Texts read\n- Journaling capability to capture thoughts and insights on each day's Daily Texts\n- Search functions by word or Bible verse\n- Texts for 2017-2021\n- Indicators for favorite Daily Texts and Texts read\n- Notifications\n\nProduced by the Interprovincial Board of Communication of the Moravian Church in America, the texts in this app are contained in the North American printed versions of the Moravian Daily Texts 2021 (note: hymn texts available in the printed versions are not included in this app). The Daily Texts are shared in more than 50 languages around the world.\n\nFor more information about the Moravian Daily Texts, please visit www.moravian.org."

It brings the teachings of St. Teresa of Avila and St. John Paul II alive as it leads you ever more deeply into the mysteries through beautiful sacred art,  scripture readings,  meditations, and clausular aspirations. If you desire to know the mysteries for the first time, or more deeply than ever before, this app will lead you into the glorious vision of the life of Christ through the eyes of the Mother of God. This app is based on the best-selling Catholic book “The Contemplative Rosary” written by Dan Burke and Connie Rossini.

      "label": "A great resource for those who want to go back and forth between Maya and Christian Calendar dates.  No internet connection needed, so it can be in your pocket as you travel through Maya ruins and use it to calculate the Gregorian calendar dates from Maya long counts on monuments.\n\nMaya Calendar gives you the Maya calendar date for today or any date in history – past, present, and future.  Convert dates back and forth between the Maya and Gregorian calendars, learn about the various Maya cycles of time, and gain a better understanding of why December 21, 2012 A.D. is an important Maya date.\n\nIn addition, this app can calculate your birthday in the Maya sacred calendar and learn what it says about your personality traits and destiny.\n\nMaya Calendar offers these great features:\n\n– The Home Page displays the current day in the Maya Calendar, both in hieroglyphs and in modern text formats.\n\n– “This Day in Maya History” cites a major event in Maya history for almost every day of the year.\n\n–  The “Maya Calendars” section provides a detailed explanation of each of the major Maya calendrical cycles, a discussion of the calendar correlation debate, and the thinking behind the possible end date of 2012 A.D.\n\n– The “Calculator” allows you to convert any Gregorian date into its Maya calendar equivalent.\n\n– The “Long Count” feature allows you to convert any Maya Long Count date into its Gregorian calendar equivalent. \n\n– The “Birthdays” feature allows you to calculate and store the Maya birthdays of everyone you know. Once calculated, the app provides a host of information about that individual: personality traits; animal, color, and directional associations; and events in Maya history that occurred on the same date as their birth.\n\n– The “Known Birthdays” feature lists and saves the names of everyone whose Maya birthday you have recorded and notifies you when their birthday comes around.\n\n– “What to Do Today” lists the activities that modern Maya calendar priests recommend for any given day.\n\nMaya Calendar, created by Dr. Ed Barnhart, is an invaluable tool for students investigating Maya inscriptions, and for anyone fascinated with the workings of the Maya calendar."

Quickly find rhymes, near rhymes (including slant rhymes), synonyms, antonyms, homophones, similar sounding words, words with the same consonant pattern, and other related words (generalizations, specializations, words appearing in the same context). Use Apple's local dictionaries or ours online if you are unsure of any meanings.\n\nYou get a database of over 150,000 words and phrases right at your fingertips. Find rhymes without an Internet connection, but if you are online, we'll connect you to RhymeZone.com for definitions and all the other great features you've come to love, ad-free! Or you can look it up on our sister site, OneLook.com, or even hear it pronounced with your device's built-in text-to-speech.\n\nThere's also a nifty \"Poet Maker\" feature, which lets you find words that match constraints on both rhyme and meaning at the same time. For example, suppose you want a word that rhymes with \"cat\" and means \"heavy\"; this feature will answer \"fat\" in no time. Or suppose you're looking for a rhyme of \"curious\" that means \"invalid\"; you'll get \"spurious\". You get the idea!\n\nSo whether you're aspiring to be the next Shakespeare, looking to put on the finishing touches of a love poem, bust out the next rap lyric, or just seeking some clever wordplay for your English assignment, give the app a try!"

Search for answers in HSVG, a massive & constantly growing database of equine health info – conveniently available to you “horse side.” \n\nHSVG was created by Doug Thal DVM DABVP, a lifelong horseman & veterinarian that has practiced exclusively equine veterinary medicine for over 20 years & is board certified in equine practice.  \n\nHSVG provides helpful information about equine health from the moment you notice a problem with your horse - My Observation.  It contains practical advice, suggested skills, and questions to discuss with your vet.\n\nHSVG is of value in an emergency and non-emergency, and it helps you distinguish between the two. HSVG also contains dozens of high quality instructional videos, and other media designed to enable you to become an active participant in ensuring your horse’s good health.  \n\nHowever, HSVG is not structured as a simple decision tree that takes you down a singular path based on your input. It is not a substitute for your local equine veterinarian. It does not, and cannot, anticipate and address all of the subtle variations and unique circumstances associated with your horse’s health. That is your veterinarian's job.\n__________________________\n\n- Make better decisions about your horse’s health.\n- Increase the quality of communication between you and your vet.\n- Follow a logical thought process for addressing any equine heath care problem.\n- Utilize a quality alternative to Dr. Google.\n\nOk – so what is Horse Side Vet Guide exactly? \n\nHSVG is a custom-built relational database of equine health information that contains concise information about common problems to rare diseases.  Records are contained in 1 of 9 categories:\n\n- My Observations\n- Vet Diagnostics\n- Vet Diagnoses\n- Vet Treatments\n- My Skills\n- My Supplies\n- Terms & Topics\n- Media\n- Outside Resources\n\nThese records are extensively interlinked, providing a uniquely contextualized approach to any equine health issue. \n\nWe continuously add and update the records in HSVG. We have placed great emphasis on completing the MY OBSERVATIONS records first. You can find \"full access\" records with a keyword search, in the alphabetical browse lists, and hyperlinked inside other records. Incomplete (or \"partial access\") records are listed inside full access records, with no hyperlink. Many other records are hidden from view, and will be available later. After we complete a partial or hidden record we change it to \"full access\" and it becomes immediately available to you after the app has been synchronized to your mobile device. \n\nPlease see our website www.horsesidevetguide.com for more information about this application."

The reading plan and audio Bible means you can read or listen to the Bible.\n\n** Strong's Concordance **\nTouch Bible helps you comprehend tough words. Those difficult words are finally given clarity with only a tap. What is the Strong's Concordance? The words in the Bible are numbered. Those numbers (Strong numbers) are tied to definitions (lexicons) from the original languages of the Bible. Sounds technical? Touch Bible makes this so easy:\n1. While you read the bible you'll see that most words are buttons.\n2. Tap on a word and you'll get so much information about the word. If you need to look up a word simply search for it (or it's number) and tap the link in the Bible reader.\n\nWhat resources are included in the Concordance?\n- Instant definitions include information from combined resources:\n+ \"Strong's Lexicons\" (Greek and Hebrew)\n+ \"Brown, Driver, Briggs Lexicon\" (BDB)\n+ \"Theological Word Book of the O.T.\" \n+ \"Thayer's and Smith's Bible Dictionary\"\n+ \"Kittel\"\n\n** List of Benefits **\n- Attach Images to your own notes (church bulletins, etc.).\n- Search for words or Strong numbers!\n- Study Articles - learn more with thousands of articles\n- Universal - works on iPad, iPhone and iPod Touch.\n- Dial a Verse : Touch Bible's way of looking up scripture FAST (See Screenshots)\n- Shake a Verse : Like flipping through the pages of a book to find a page to read.

      "label": "SkySafari 6 Pro will revolutionize your astronomical viewing experience.  It has the largest database of any astronomy app, includes every solar system object ever discovered, offers unparalleled accuracy, flawless telescope control, Augmented Reality (AR) mode, and provides the very best experience under the stars when you depend on it. Discover why SkySafari 6 Pro is the #1 recommended astronomy app for serious amateur astronomers since 2009.\n\nHere's what's new in version 6:\n\n1) Complete support for iOS 13 and iPhone 11. We release regular updates.\n\n2) Clouds and Astronomy. Two words that rarely go together. SkySafari 6 Pro will (optionally) back up all of your observing data in our secure cloud storage and make it easily accessible to multiple devices as well as from our new web interface, LiveSky.com.\n\n3) We Have The Best Stars. Precise, modern and deep. We’ve updated our star catalog to use the latest and greatest, UCAC5 star catalog. If 25 million stars down to 15th magnitude isn’t enough for you, an easy in-app purchase gets you down to 16.5 magnitude and a whopping 100 million stars!\n\n4) We Have The Best Galaxies. The PGC catalog includes galaxies down to 18th magnitude. Want more galaxies? How about 2.6 million more? An in-app purchase gives you access to the largest galaxy database available for your device.\n\n5) Observers First. A redesign of our tools puts the active observer first. Quick access to features like your equipment, observing sites, lists, and observations make it easy and enjoyable to get out, observe, and record your observations. The observing sessions feature lets you collect your observations into groups that span a few hours, or a few nights.\n\n6) Graph It. The completely new graph tool will give a quick visual representation of an object’s altitude above the horizon. Essential for planning your night’s observations.\n\n7) Plan It. Make the most of your time under the stars. Our updated planner is a powerful tool that lets you create a list of targets for your observing session with filters like object types, specific time ranges, constellation, catalog, and more. Plan it and get more done.\n\n8) Say It. Ever just wanted to just yell at your device and tell it what to do!? SkySafari 6 adds basic voice control for a wide range of operations. Say “select Jupiter,” “search for Titan,” “center on Polaris” and SkySafari will do the work for you. Yelling optional. \n\n9) Tilt It. Every old astronomy app these days lets your tilt and pan your device to show different parts of the sky, but who else lets you control your telescope that way!? “Tilt to slew” is an optional mode allowing you to keep your eye in the eyepiece, and, using the accelerometers in your device, gently translate the movements of your hands into smooth telescope motion.\n\n10) Share It. SkySafari 6 is more than just a mobile app, it’s a new system to help organize and share your observing experiences. With a free signup, you can see and share your observing data from our web portal, LiveSky.com! Affordable premium memberships add online editing, so you can not only view, but edit your observations, add new observing sites, manage your equipment and more. Finally, (coming soon) you can view, edit and manage your settings files with SkySafari Web, our fully functional web version.\n\nIf you haven't used SkySafari 6 Pro before, here's what you can do with it:\n\n• Hold your device up, and SkySafari 6 Pro will find stars, constellations, planets, and more! The star chart updates automatically with your movements for the ultimate stargazing experience.\n\n• Simulate the night sky up to 10,000 years in the past or future! Animate meteor showers, conjunctions, eclipses, and other celestial events.\n\n• Control your telescope, log and plan your observations.\n\n• Night Vision.\n\n• Orbit Mode. Leave the Earth’s surface behind, and fly through our solar system.\n\n• Galaxy View shows the position of deep sky objects in our Milky Way!\n\n• Much more!"

The number and scope of the videos and content will continue to increase.\n\nR Instructor will teach you how to use R, how to make and modify plots and run statistical tests. Each example includes a very brief (and easy to understand!) description of the function or test, any statistical assumptions, how to structure your data in R, the R scripts (code) and, links to other free and online resources.  Where appropriate, the Mac, Windows and RStudio versions of the R interface are explained separately.\n\nR Instructor also allows you to run RStudio through the web from your iPad or iPhone (Note: This is a public server that requires an internet connection -- do not expect to accomplish serious computing)\n\nIn addition, R Instructor comes complete with 10 Quick Reference guides and the \"Which Test?\" feature. The \"Which Test?\" feature guides you to the correct statistical test after you answer questions related to your data.\n\n\nSee a demonstration of R Instructor at, www.Rinstructor.com\n\nUse R Instructor to...\n\nRun a public web server implementation of RStudio (do not expect serious computing power -- this server is for testing and debugging scripts)\n\n\nLearn R's fundamentals:\n- R's interface\n- Create objects\n- Install libraries\\packages\n- Import and export data and plots\n- Merge data frames\n- Exclude redundant data between datasets\n- Import dates\n- Create custom functions\n- Summarize data frames and matrices\n- Perform calculations\n- and more...\n\nLearn how to make and customize plots:\n- qplots from ggplot2\n- Box plots\n- Bar plots\n- Histograms\n- Line charts\n- Scatter plots and scatter plot matrices\n- Add and customize legends\n- Add custom axis labels\n- Modify the size, shape and colour of point markers\n- Add axis titles\n- Add lines, text or points to an existing plot\n- Add colour to the plot background, border lines… and just about anything else!\n\n\nLearn these (and more) statistical tests:\n- One-sample t-test\n- Two-sample t-test\n- Paired t-test\n- Correlation\n- Rank correlation\n- Linear regression\n- Multiple regression\n- Logistic regression\n- Log-linear models\n- F-test\n- One-way ANOVA\n- Two-way ANOVA\n- One-way repeated measures ANOVA \n- Two-way repeated measures ANOVA  \n- Regression and Classification trees\n- ANCOVA\n- MANOVA\n- Principal Components Analysis\n- Linear discriminant function analysis\n- Redundancy analysis\n- Friedman test\n- Wilcoxon signed rank test\n- Kruskal-Wallis test\n- Chi-square test of independence\n- Binomial test\n- Hierarchical clustering\n- and more…\n\nPlus,\n- Over 35 videos (that's over two hours)\n- 10 Quick Reference Guides\n- The \"Which test?\" feature – An assistant to guide you to the appropriate statistical test"

Its intrinsic value will not only be of great interest to those studying American heritage and Christian studies, but also to writers and those exploring poetry.\n\nNoah Websters 1828 American Dictionary contains the greatest number of Biblical definitions given in any reference volume. It is an invaluable resource written when American values and patriotism were based on Christian values.\n\nOf interest to poets and writers, The Noah Webster dictionary was used extensively by Emily Dickinson. We know that she made frequent and extensive use of Noah Webster's American Dictionary of the English Language in writing her poems, paying attention not only to the definitions but also to Webster's etymologies and his illustrative quotations.\n\nBeing able to see how definitions have evolved today is fascinating, and a great resource when studying.\n\nYou can easily search or browse the entire dictionary and add favourites to revisit later.\n\nApp design by professional app developer NASDA Studios."

Those who pray the Rosary regularly will appreciate how closely iRosary resembles a traditional Catholic Rosary.\n\n\nHOW IT WORKS:\nJust like a classic Rosary.

      "label": "SkySafari 6 Plus goes beyond most basic astronomy apps by providing you with a full-featured space simulator with telescope control and Augmented Reality (AR) mode.\n\nNote that there is no discount upgrade path from SkySafari 6 Plus to SkySafari 6 Pro. Choose carefully!\n\nHere's what's new in version 6:\n\n1) Complete support for iOS 13 and iPhone 11. We got you covered and release regular updates.\n\n2) Clouds and Astronomy. Two words that rarely go together. Rewritten from the ground up, SkySafari 6 Plus will (optionally) back up all of your observing data in our secure cloud storage and make it easily accessible to multiple devices as well as from our new web interface, LiveSky.com.\n\n3) We Have The Best Stars. Precise, modern and deep. We’ve updated our star catalog to use the latest and greatest, UCAC5 star catalog.\n\n4) Observers First. A redesign of our tools puts the active observer first. Quick access to features like your equipment, observing sites, lists, and observations make it easy and enjoyable to get out, observe, and record your observations.\n\n5) Graph It. The completely new graph tool will give a quick visual representation of an object’s altitude above the horizon. Essential for planning your night’s observations.\n\n6) Plan It. Make the most of your time under the stars. Our updated planner is a powerful tool that lets you create a list of targets for your observing session with filters like object types, specific time ranges, constellation, catalog, and more. Plan it and get more done.\n\n7) Say It. Ever just wanted to just yell at your device and tell it what to do!? SkySafari 6 adds basic voice control for a wide range of operations. Say “select Jupiter,” “search for Titan,” “center on Polaris” and SkySafari will do the work for you. Yelling optional. \n\n8) Tilt It. Every old astronomy app these days lets your tilt and pan your device to show different parts of the sky, but who else lets you control your telescope that way!? “Tilt to slew” is an optional mode allowing you to keep your eye in the eyepiece, and, using the accelerometers in your device, gently translate the movements of your hands into smooth telescope motion.\n\n9) Share It. SkySafari 6 is more than just a mobile app, it’s a new system to help organize and share your observing experiences. With a free signup, you can see and share your observing data from our web portal, LiveSky.com! Affordable premium memberships add online editing, so you can not only view, but edit your observations, add new observing sites, manage your equipment and more. Finally, (coming soon) you can view, edit and manage your settings files with SkySafari Web, our fully functional web version.\n\nIf you haven't used SkySafari 6 Plus before, here's what you can do with it:\n\n• Hold your device up, and SkySafari 6 Plus will find stars, constellations, planets, and more!\n\n• Simulate the night sky up to 10,000 years in the past or future! Animate meteor showers, conjunctions, eclipses, and other celestial events.\n\n• Learn the history, mythology, and science of astronomy! Browse over 1500 object descriptions and astronomical images. Explore NASA space missions! Stay up-to-date with SkyWeek for all major sky events every day!\n\n• Control your telescope, log and plan your observations.\n\n• Night Vision  – Preserve your eyesight after dark.\n\n• Orbit Mode. Leave the Earth’s surface behind, and fly through our solar system.\n\n• Time Flow – Follow the motion of sky objects as days, months, and years are compressed into a few seconds.\n\n• Advanced Search – Find objects using properties other than their name.\n\n• Support for Apple Watch!\n\n• Tonight at a Glance: the Sun, Moon, Planets, ISS, and Iridium flares in one handy view!\n\n• Notifications when the ISS will pass overhead, when Iridium satellites flare, and more!\n\n• Much more!\n\nFor even more features, and a gigantic database aimed at the most dedicated amateur or professional astronomer, check out SkySafari 6 Pro!"

      "label": "The IAP Bushings & Tubes app provides a searchable and sortable interface to over 4000 pen kits from most of the major kit suppliers. The app displays detailed tube and bushing specifications and drill bit requirements for every kit in the app database. These kit details can be emailed or printed via Air Print. You can create a favorites list of your most frequently used kits for faster access to those kits rather than searching through the entire app database every time you need to reference those kits. You can also reorder the database by your preferred supplier order.\n\nThe app also includes a drill bit converter for converting between inch fractional, inch decimal, metric and gauge drill sizes. Conversions to inch fractional are made to the nearest 1/64\" and conversions to gauge drill size are made to the nearest gauge drill size (107-1 and A-Z). An error factor is displayed for inexact conversions to inch fractional and gauge drill size.\n\nA 30-digit, 4-function calculator is included in the app. It has several advanced features not found in many simple calculators including a memory cell and the ability to display data in decimal or scientific notation.\n\nPhotos, Instructions and Bushing Drawings are available for most of the kits. When instructions or bushings are available, they may be viewed, mailed or printed.\n\nThe app also contains several lists of useful references: Worldwide Suppliers of pen kits with links to take you directly to their web site; Helpful Penturning videos with links that will take you directly to the video; and Penturning Tutorials with links that will download the tutorial to your device for viewing in the app or to email or print.\n\nThe app will automatically download database updates and the kit reference files from the IAP server."

      "label": "*** Planning to go bird watching in Ecuador? Then this is the app for you. This app fills a gap in the region and is the only app available for Ecuador! It is based on renowned reference work of the Helm Guide Series \"Birds of Northern South America\" by Robin Restall, Clemencia Rodner, and Miguel Lentino. The creation of apps from the book is a co-production between Bloomsbury Plc and Sunbird Images. The app contains 5,000 illustrations and more than 3,000 bird songs and calls in total.  \n\n>> Neotropical Birding Magazine writes:\n\n*** \"Condensing Restall’s two-volume work into an app, while remaining usable, is no mean feat - and Sunbird Images deserve recognition  for successfully doing so. Navigation is admirably straightforward.\" ***\n\n*** \"Two nice touches are displaying the sonogram in ‘real time’ with the vocalisation, and a ‘loop’ facility to make playback more manageable.\" ***\n\n*** \"The app is self-evidently the equal of Restall et al. as an identification tool, and a smartphone is so much more portable than a field guide. Moreover, the in-built vocalisations are arguably worth the purchase price alone...\" ***\n\n\nThis app is part of the Sunbird Images BLUE LABEL series. Our BLUE LABEL series are top notch digital field guides which provide the most comprehensive data available for a region or taxon. They stand for completeness including even the very rare species and vagrants which have only been recorded once or a few times in a region. Even the rare species are illustrated and described in detail featured with a full species account.\n\nNo other bird app for this region offers the following:\n\n- Includes all 1,612 Ecuadorian bird species including all vagrants\n- Selection of 5,000 illustrations from the reference work \"Birds of Northern South America\"\n- All subspecies + geographic, age and sex variations illustrated\n- 3,158 bird songs and calls\n- Most advanced Compare Mode of any bird app - compare up to 16 species images / songs / maps\n- Spectrograms of all songs + details where songs were recorded\n- Detailed distribution maps of Northern South America down to subspecies level\n- Introduction contains hints and links on bird watching in Ecuador\n- Create sighting lists and sort by place, date, group, and name\n- Automatically plots all birds on a map via GPS (editable)\n- Make notes for each bird spotted\n- A simple identification key narrows species down \n- Sort and display species: A–Z, 6 different languages, taxonomic\n\nEcuador is a prime birding spot and a country of extremes. It covers altitudes between coastal regions up to heights of more than 6,000 m and habitats that include coasts with beaches, Desert Woodland and Arid Scrub, Páramo, Temperate as well as Subtropical Montane Forest (Cloud Forest/ Elfin Woodland), the Amazon Rainforest in particular, Swamps and Mangroves. Ecuador has the largest biodiversity per square kilometre in the world, with an unlimited number of possibilities for birding. \n\nChoose between 6 bird name languages: \nEnglish, Latin, Spanish, French, Dutch, German\n\nNarrow species down by foot colour, bill shape, tail length etc. leading to the bird searched for plus a choice of similar species. You can also look for fragments of a species name – the search for “finch“ shows all the species which include the word “finch“ in the species’ name.\n\n***A graphically well-designed layout – easy to use with large lettering.*** \n\n\"All Birds Ecuador\" is very well suited for keeping personalised bird watch lists.\n\nThe app will be continuously developed further. All updates are free of charge. Once downloaded no internet connection needed – just download the app and start birding!\n\nVisit our internet support site for more information www.sunbird.tv. We are happy, if you like our app. Please don't hesitate to email us if you have any questions or suggestions or comments at: bnsa@sunbird.tv"

Moreover, an ornithological dictionary (English, French, Spanish, Portuguese) and detailed illustrations and drawings of bird anatomy are included.\n\nThe app features a modern, intuitive graphical user interface with functions for searching the birds‘ names and in the full text, switching the sorting language for the listings and sort by English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, or the scientific (Latin) notation. In addition to the bird descriptions, the name of the birds in many languages can be displayed.\n\nAnother clever feature is the Field Note Editor, which allows you to record your bird sightings with predefined locations settings (which can be overwritten by the user) and many other commonly recorded data items.\n\nApart from using the optional backup and restore functions for Field Notes and Favorites, the app runs completely offline and there is no need for an internet connection during usage in the field.\n\nAs with The Birds of South America, which contains more than 3,000 birds found on the entire continent, also The Birds of Colombia runs on any iOS device and can exchange Field Notes and Favorites list between identical app versions on two or more devices via Bluetooth."

Unlike other Tibetan-English electronic dictionaries available, which are a conglomeration of materials garnered from pre-existing translations and other sources, the Illuminator is created entry by entry by a scholar of many years experience who lives and works in daily contact with Tibetan scholars and translates for the great teachers of the Tibetan Buddhist world.  Each entry is produced by individually translating and explaining the terms involved. In general, the Illuminator has been praised for its absence of mistakes, excellence of presentation, and the exceptional and forward-looking quality of the work contained within it.\n\nThe dictionary is an ongoing work.  A new version of the dictionary, with substantial improvements, is delivered at the beginning of January each year.  This 2017 version includes everything in the 2016 edition plus all of the new entries and editorial work done through the end of 2016.  To update from an earlier version of the dictionary to the 2017 version, purchase this version dictionary."

It allows sorting by distance or by Trustee callsign as well as filtering by band and radius in miles or kilometers.\n\nNOW RFinder Routing is integrated with RT Systems radio programmers! Your subscription bought here by installing this app gives you access in RT...just make sure RT is updated to the latest version by pressing Help-Update. Click File-External Data->RFinder Web Search and click Route! Easy as pie to program your radio now for a trip you are taking with just a few easy clicks...check out the tutorial video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaeRzcnNNdQ\n\nNOW INCLUDES SOCIAL FUNCTIONS!!!! In the repeater detail screen, click the Check In button. All users will see that you are on that machine! This can be used to find your friends or a machine with a user on it. In the settings bundle app/RFinder you can turn on APRS posting. This posts your current position with the repeater you are checked into. You can also let your friends on Facebook® know what repeater you are on as well as your Twitter® followers, when checking in.\n\nNOW INTEGRATED WITH THE EchoLink APP!!\nFrom the repeater detail screen, any repeater that has an Echolink node attached just touch the number and if you have the EchoLink app installed it will launch to that node automatically for you.\n\nOur repeater locator database is growing daily.\nAccess to the Directory is included for one year then it will be an annual subscription for $9.99, and your subscription works for all platforms.... Each purchase of a new platform advances your annual to a year from that new purchase date. Sub\n\nIf we do not have your repeaters listed...please do not refund or give us a bad rating...add repeaters at http://add.rfinder.net or request an add or update from the app.. Don't forget LAT/LON (in decimal), use periods as decimals, please.\n\nThe application accesses our Worldwide Repeater Directory and scanner directory for Amateur Radio (Ham Radio) but only stores information for repeaters within approximately 80 miles (125 km) from your location on your handheld at any one time, saving you room on your device and allowing distance calculation and mapping features to operate smoothly. It uses geolocation either via cell tower triangulation, GPS or manual location entry (so you can look up the repeaters you will use on vacation or business trips, etc.).\n\nIf anyone has lists of Amateur Radio repeaters from their countries we would love to incorporate that into our database.\n\nWorldwide IRLP and Echolink nodes.\n\n© ITWeRKS 2011"

      "label": "This application is for any gun owner! The purpose of this app is for the legal and conscientious concealed carry license holder to know where they cannot legally carry before getting there. A licensed permit holder or a resident of a constitutional carry state can usually legally carry their firearm in any location other than statutory \"no carry\" locations such as schools, gov. buildings, etc., and in businesses that are posted prohibiting firearms. This is a list of those Posted Anti-Gun businesses. \n\nThis #1-selling app of its kind (both on Apple App Store and other platforms) already includes over 19,000 current anti-gun locations and 17,000 pro-2a alternatives.\n\nFind hotels where you can’t carry before booking a trip to one. Find restaurants where you cannot carry before making dinner plans. Find stores to avoid before you step out the door. It is extremely inconvenient to not find out until you get to a location that they prohibit your second amendment rights. You have to either disarm in the parking lot (causing your vehicle to be a target for thieves) or go somewhere else at the last second. If you know beforehand, you can avoid the places that prohibit carry, or you can leave your firearm at home if you must attend. \n\nWe have a comprehensive list of \"Posted anti-gun\" locations collected in Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin. We have assembled smaller lists in  Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Idaho, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Utah, West Virginia, and Wyoming; provided by many great gun forums and sites with their permission. Since it is crowd-sourced by users like you, please help the list continue to grow!\n\nThe app also includes the option to add pro-gun alternatives that do not prohibit carry.  Search for pro-gun substitutes to the anti-gun businesses.  Easily add new ones to the list every time you experience firearm-friendly (or neutral) service.\n\nThis app includes the easy ability to take action.  Call or email a listed business to let them know your opinion!\n\nLaws regarding signage, and prohibited locations (no sign needed) vary by state. To understand your state’s specific laws, download \"CCW – 50 State Guide\" (http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id443321291). \n\nThis list is user-updated, and will continue to get better over time. But this relies on you! If you go to a place not on the list and they have a sign, please add it with a few clicks via the \"Add a Business\" button! If a place had taken down their sign, get it removed the same way! If you already have a list of anti-gun businesses in your area or state, send us an email. We would love to include any data you have collected, and give you credit for it! \n\nIf you experience any bugs or issues, please email (using the \"Feedback\" button) before leaving app feedback. \n\nDisclaimer: This application implies no warranty regarding the ability to legally carry in any locale or situation and does not constitute legal advice. Every user is responsible for knowing and abiding by the laws in his or her state. Some areas are illegal to carry by statute, even without signage. If unsure, contact local law enforcement or legal counsel. All information provided is simply the opinion of various users who added the location. By downloading and/or purchasing the application, you agree that you assume all risk and are responsible for confirming legality and abiding by all firearm laws. Please see full Disclaimer on Developer Website (below).\n\nThis application was built by Nantz Consulting & Workman Consulting LLC."

Once scanned, the product entry will show  its date code or status, and if your package’s date is before the one shown on the app, you will know it is yoshon!\n\n——————\n\nYour very own customizable grocery Favorites List! For those who buy specific items repeatedly, this is a “must-have” feature! \nFrom the \"My Favorites\" (Favs button) screen, search for your product, and save it as a “Favorite”, by clicking on the small heart icon (found in the upper right corner of each product entry). Once this is done, it saves it instantly to your Favorites List!\n\nThe next time you want to go shopping for that item, go to your Favorites list by tapping on the “Favs” button at the bottom. It will bring up the “My Favorites” screen, where you can click on that product and bring it up immediately. It is that easy, and makes shopping for yoshon items a breeze!!\n\n——————\n\nTo contact us, choose text, phone, or WhatsApp chatting. The WhatsApp chat goes to the private texting.\n\nWith over 2,200 product entries (and that number is constantly growing), there are plenty of items to choose from that we have yoshon information on. We hope that you will find our exciting new app to be something you just can’t live without!\n\n---------"

      "label": "THE PREMIER IPAD ATLAS - with RETINA VECTOR MAPS\n\nThe World HD is unique in the app store because it includes both a complete set of country maps AND the largest world fact book.  These enable it to answer questions which Atlases and fact books cannot:  Atlases show you where countries are located, but have very little information about them; fact books tell you about each country, but their maps leave you guessing about where places are located.\n\n\n___________ HOW IT WORKS ___________\n\nThe interface is animated and interactive.  Touch a country on the world map and the Retina vector country map opens while the factbook slides onto the screen, each topic neatly organized as tiles along the edge of the map.

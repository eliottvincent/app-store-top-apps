      "label": "Find the right word wherever you go. The official RhymeZone iOS app is a fast, powerful rhyming dictionary and thesaurus that you can use anywhere, even if you're not on the net. Quickly find rhymes, near rhymes (including slant rhymes), synonyms, antonyms, homophones, similar sounding words, words with the same consonant pattern, and other related words (generalizations, specializations, words appearing in the same context). Use Apple's local dictionaries or ours online if you are unsure of any meanings.\n\nYou get a database of over 150,000 words and phrases right at your fingertips. Find rhymes without an Internet connection, but if you are online, we'll connect you to RhymeZone.com for definitions and all the other great features you've come to love, ad-free! Or you can look it up on our sister site, OneLook.com, or even hear it pronounced with your device's built-in text-to-speech.\n\nThere's also a nifty \"Poet Maker\" feature, which lets you find words that match constraints on both rhyme and meaning at the same time. For example, suppose you want a word that rhymes with \"cat\" and means \"heavy\"; this feature will answer \"fat\" in no time. Or suppose you're looking for a rhyme of \"curious\" that means \"invalid\"; you'll get \"spurious\". You get the idea!\n\nSo whether you're aspiring to be the next Shakespeare, looking to put on the finishing touches of a love poem, bust out the next rap lyric, or just seeking some clever wordplay for your English assignment, give the app a try!"

      "label": "The Lost Person Behavior App is based upon the Search and Rescue (SAR) international gold standard reference tool on where to look for lost and missing persons. Every Public Safety Official needs to know where the missing person might be, what to ask, where to look, and what to do when minutes matter. The app was built around the field needs of Public Safety Officials.  No matter how remote the location, the app continues to function since no network connection is required, once installed.\n\nThis life-saving information is customized for 41 different subject categories. The categories are organized into a hierarchy of groups including external factors (abductions, aircraft), water incidents (boats and persons in the water), wheeled incidents (ATV, mountain bikes, vehicles, etc.), mental states (autism, dementia, despondent, intellectual disability, mental illness, substance intoxication), children (in five different age groups), and eighteen outdoor activities (hiker, hunter, climber, gatherer, skier, etc.).\n\nThe app guides the user in selecting the correct subject category by several means. The subject category wizard allows the user to select potential scenarios and then will suggest the best match for the subject category.  For example, if a child was riding his bicycle and was then known to be abducted, the user could select Child, Wheel/Motorized, and Abduction; the wizard would suggest using the abduction category. Alternately, the user can go straight to a subject category by using favorites, an alphabetical list, or the hierarchy list. Once the subject category is selected, the Lost Person Behavior App provides the user with: \n•\tbehavioral profiles\n•\ttactical briefings\n•\tspecific investigative questions\n•\tspatial and survival statistics\n•\tsuggestions for initial tasks (reflex tasking).\n\nThe all-new tactical briefings distill the statistics and profiles to the key points that every field searcher must know. The more extensive profile, full statistics, and suggested initial tasks assist even the seasoned search planner. The highly detailed questions for the investigation resulted from decades of SAR experience and thousands of missions.\n\nThe app even allows you to email a checklist of these critical tasks and interview questions so that you may print them out.  The email could also be used for providing remote support or documenting tasks that have been completed.\n\nDetermining where to look is one of the major functions of the search statistics, which are now provided in a graphical and tabular format.  The statistics from thousands of SAR missions allow the search planner to see where similar previous search subjects were found. The SAR statistics include:\n•\tDistance from the Initial Planning Point\n•\tElevation model (likelihood of going up, down, or staying at the same elevation)\n•\tMobility model (how long will the subject keep moving)\n•\tDispersion angle (given a direction of travel, how well does that predict subject’s location)\n•\tTrack Offset model (how far away from a feature such as a road or trail is subject found)\n•\tFind location (at what type of geographic feature was the subject found)\n•\tScenario (what caused the subject to become missing)\n•\tSurvivability overall (what is the overall chance of finding the subject alive or injured)\n•\tSurvivability rate (how does survivability rate change in 24-hour increments).\n\nThe Lost Person Behavior App can be easily customized to only show the statistical information you actually need. The user can customize for ecoregion, terrain, and urban incidents. The user can view the data in both metric and English units. Several additional helpful tools are built into the app. Contextual help is provided on every page with additional information boxes, which explain every element of the app on the page you need.  The information page provides information about the bike wheel model used to describe initial tactical deployment (reflex tasking), a glossary, help, and contact information."

Let scripture interpret scripture.\n\nSTART LEARNING PRECEPTS NOW!\n- Start by reading the verses and passages related to each precept;\n- Get the understanding of the precept by reading the cross-linked verses;\n- You begin to see the consistency in scripture when you realise that certain words and phrases maintain specific meaning in all the verses they appear in;\n- Connect the dots and you begin to see the bigger picture of what the bible is really revealing.\n\nMORE FEATURES WITH EACH UPDATE\n- Easy navigation for chapters and verses;\n- Quickly check up on precepts listed under a verse, and link to cross-linked verses;\n- Adjust font sizes for accessibility;\n- Use the contact form to send us messages and what you've discovered;\n- Join our mailing list and get updates about our occasional updates and learning aids;\n\nREDISCOVER THE CORRECT WAY TO UNDERSTAND SCRIPTURE\n- Build up entire teaching series using bible precepts to maintain true scriptural meanings and consistency in the understanding delivered.\n\nJoin us on social media and share the gospel to wake up the lost sheep!\nShare this app with friends and family and be part of their awakening."

      "label": "This application is for any gun owner! The purpose of this app is for the legal and conscientious concealed carry license holder to know where they cannot legally carry before getting there. A licensed permit holder or a resident of a constitutional carry state can usually legally carry their firearm in any location other than statutory \"no carry\" locations such as schools, gov. buildings, etc., and in businesses that are posted prohibiting firearms. This is a list of those Posted Anti-Gun businesses. \n\nThis #1-selling app of its kind (both on Apple App Store and other platforms) already includes over 19,000 current anti-gun locations and 17,000 pro-2a alternatives.\n\nFind hotels where you can’t carry before booking a trip to one. Find restaurants where you cannot carry before making dinner plans. Find stores to avoid before you step out the door. It is extremely inconvenient to not find out until you get to a location that they prohibit your second amendment rights. You have to either disarm in the parking lot (causing your vehicle to be a target for thieves) or go somewhere else at the last second. If you know beforehand, you can avoid the places that prohibit carry, or you can leave your firearm at home if you must attend. \n\nWe have a comprehensive list of \"Posted anti-gun\" locations collected in Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin. We have assembled smaller lists in  Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Idaho, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Utah, West Virginia, and Wyoming; provided by many great gun forums and sites with their permission. Since it is crowd-sourced by users like you, please help the list continue to grow!\n\nThe app also includes the option to add pro-gun alternatives that do not prohibit carry.  Search for pro-gun substitutes to the anti-gun businesses.  Easily add new ones to the list every time you experience firearm-friendly (or neutral) service.\n\nThis app includes the easy ability to take action.  Call or email a listed business to let them know your opinion!\n\nLaws regarding signage, and prohibited locations (no sign needed) vary by state. To understand your state’s specific laws, download \"CCW – 50 State Guide\" (http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id443321291). \n\nThis list is user-updated, and will continue to get better over time. But this relies on you! If you go to a place not on the list and they have a sign, please add it with a few clicks via the \"Add a Business\" button! If a place had taken down their sign, get it removed the same way! If you already have a list of anti-gun businesses in your area or state, send us an email. We would love to include any data you have collected, and give you credit for it! \n\nIf you experience any bugs or issues, please email (using the \"Feedback\" button) before leaving app feedback. \n\nDisclaimer: This application implies no warranty regarding the ability to legally carry in any locale or situation and does not constitute legal advice. Every user is responsible for knowing and abiding by the laws in his or her state. Some areas are illegal to carry by statute, even without signage. If unsure, contact local law enforcement or legal counsel. All information provided is simply the opinion of various users who added the location. By downloading and/or purchasing the application, you agree that you assume all risk and are responsible for confirming legality and abiding by all firearm laws. Please see full Disclaimer on Developer Website (below).\n\nThis application was built by Nantz Consulting & Workman Consulting LLC."

Its intrinsic value will not only be of great interest to those studying American heritage and Christian studies, but also to writers and those exploring poetry.\n\nNoah Websters 1828 American Dictionary contains the greatest number of Biblical definitions given in any reference volume. It is an invaluable resource written when American values and patriotism were based on Christian values.\n\nOf interest to poets and writers, The Noah Webster dictionary was used extensively by Emily Dickinson. We know that she made frequent and extensive use of Noah Webster's American Dictionary of the English Language in writing her poems, paying attention not only to the definitions but also to Webster's etymologies and his illustrative quotations.\n\nBeing able to see how definitions have evolved today is fascinating, and a great resource when studying.\n\nYou can easily search or browse the entire dictionary and add favourites to revisit later.\n\nApp design by professional app developer NASDA Studios."

I've been using it all the time playing ALL TES games!\" - Demokratiya (Russia)\n\n\"Since I'm an alt-holic and spend tons of time just trying to come up with names, this app helps me out so much. I definitely recommend this for anyone who spends time trying to get lore appropriate names for their toons :D\" - Nicholas castillo (USA)\n\nNow is the time to find out just how using Name Generator for The Elder Scrolls Online may assist YOUR search for your ideal character name. Just select your preferred race and gender, then press \"Generate name\" and let the endless stream of lore-friendly names inspire you.\n\nThis name generator allows you to easily establish a distinctive, lore-friendly name to use in The Elder Scrolls Online®, the massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by ZeniMax Online Studios® and published by Bethesda Softworks®.\n\nName Generator for The Elder Scrolls Online invites you to taste all the rich and diverse flavours of Tamrielic names, combining more than 10.000 hand-picked male, female and surnames from all the playable races, i.e. Altmer (High Elf), Argonian, Bosmer (Wood Elf), Breton, Dunmer (Dark Elf; separately including names of both Dunmer and Velothi/Ashlander origin), Imperial, Khajiit, Nord, Orsimer (Orc), and Redguard, as well as including a modest number of Ayleid names as a small bonus for those who want inspiration for a name as a claimant of the true heirs to Imperial City. All generated names are, to a general extent, adhering to the lore of Tamriel and the Elder Scrolls® universe, but the names are generated for inspirational purposes primarily, and it's up to you to define the unique story of how your character acquired his/her name.\n\nNow, let the endless stream of lore-friendly names inspire you, allowing you to create a distinct, immersion-enhancing name you will be proud to bear in the realm of Tamriel!\n\nNote: While this name generator can supply both first and last names for all races, Redguards traditionally have only been called by their given name in general, and the Altmer, Argonians, Bosmer and Khajiit generally lost their tradition to bear surnames somewhere between 3E 405 and 3E 427. It is recommended to pay regard to these naming conventions when naming characters of the above races, however you are free to generate inspirational names of both options for any race.\n\nLegal disclaimer: This application is a fan's humble tribute to Tamriel's captivating lore and hopefully a useful tool for those who choose to blissfully dwell there, but it is not affiliated with or endorsed by neither the developer, ZeniMax Online Studios®, nor the publisher, Bethesda Softworks®, of The Elder Scrolls Online®. This name generator is solely intended to assist fans and subscribers of the MMORPG in choosing a name which accomodates their preferences, as well as stimulating a more lore-friendly world in-game."

In this way the Strong's Concordance provides an independent check against translations, and offers an opportunity for greater, and more technically accurate understanding of the Bible text.\n\nWant to see it in action before you buy? Try Strong's Concordance Lite which provides a 100% functional demo of Matthew and Genesis.\n\nThis program does not require internet access, everything you need is all stored on the iDevice.\n\nFeatures:\n* Search for English words, and lookup Greek/Hebrew dictionaries.\n* Proper concordance, listing how the word was translated in other bible verses.\n* Full King James Text is included\n* Click on any blue word for concordance text.\n* Night mode for those that like to read at night (White on black)\n* iPad support\n\nPlease note: This version is not an \"exhaustive\" concordance, and does skip smaller words such as \"and, or, the, a\" as well as some other words. Though we think you'll find it has most (if not all) the words you'll ever need.\n\nWe're open to suggestions for improvement in future versions.

If you need to look up a word simply search for it (or it's number) and tap the link in the Bible reader.\n\nWhat resources are included in the Concordance?\n- Instant definitions include information from combined resources:\n+ \"Strong's Lexicons\" (Greek and Hebrew)\n+ \"Brown, Driver, Briggs Lexicon\" (BDB)\n+ \"Theological Word Book of the O.T.\" \n+ \"Thayer's and Smith's Bible Dictionary\"\n+ \"Kittel\"\n\n** List of Benefits **\n- Attach Images to your own notes (church bulletins, etc.).\n- Search for words or Strong numbers!\n- Study Articles - learn more with thousands of articles\n- Universal - works on iPad, iPhone and iPod Touch.\n- Dial a Verse : Touch Bible's way of looking up scripture FAST (See Screenshots)\n- Shake a Verse : Like flipping through the pages of a book to find a page to read.

      "label": "*** Planning to go bird watching in Colombia? Then this is the app for you. This app fills a gap in the region and is the only serious bird app available for Colombia. It is based on the renowned reference work of the Helm Guide Series \"Birds of Northern South America\" by Robin Restall, Clemencia Rodner, and Miguel Lentino. The creation of apps from the book is a co-production between Bloomsbury Plc. and Sunbird Images. The app contains 5,600 illustrations and more than 4,000 bird songs and calls in total. *** \n\n*** Dutch Birding Journal writes: \n\n\"Would I recommend this app to anyone going on a birding trip to Colombia or one of the other countries in Northern South America? For sure! ..., you will be provided with a load of information, a nearly complete set of bird sounds and a few useful tools and features for use in the field for relatively low money.\" ***\n\n\nThis app is part of the Sunbird Images BLUE LABEL series. Our BLUE LABEL series are top notch digital field guides which provide the most comprehensive data available for a region or taxon. They stand for completeness including even the very rare species and vagrants which have only been recorded once or a few times in a region. Even the rare species are illustrated and described in detail featured with a full species account.\n\nNo other bird app for this region offers the following:\n\n- Includes all 1,889 Colombian bird species including all vagrants\n- 5,600 illustrations from the Helm Guide Series \"Birds of Northern South America\" \n- Covers all subspecies + geographic, age and sex variations\n- 4,054 bird songs and calls\n- Most advanced Compare Mode of any bird app - compare up to 16 species images / songs / maps\n- Spectrograms of all songs + details where songs were recorded\n- Introduction contains hints and links on bird watching in Colombia\n- Detailed distribution maps of Northern South America down to subspecies level\n- Create sighting lists on a map via GPS and sort by place, date, group, and name\n- Make notes for each bird spotted\n- A simple identification key narrows species down \n- Sort and display species: A–Z, 6 different languages, taxonomic\n\nColombia is the “Land of Birds” with vast natural richness and a number of natural superlatives. With its nearly 1,900 species it covers about 20 % of the world's bird species population with 78 endemic species covered in this app. \n\nChoose between 6 bird name languages: \nEnglish, Spanish, French, Dutch, German, Latin\n\nNarrow species down by foot colour, bill shape, tail length etc. leading to the bird searched for plus a choice of similar species. You can also look for fragments of a species name – the search for “finch“ shows all the species which include the word “finch“ in the species’ name.\n\n***A graphically well-designed layout – easy to use with large lettering.*** \n\n\"All Birds Colombia\" is very well suited for keeping personalised bird watch lists.\n\nThe app will continuously be developed further. All updates are free of charge. Once downloaded no internet connection needed – just download the app and start birding!\n\nVisit our internet support site for more information www.sunbird.tv.

No truth is more evident to my mind than that the Christian religion must be the basis of any government intended to secure the rights and privileges of a free people.\"\n\nNoah Webster, the Father of American Christian education, wrote the first American dictionary and established a system of rules to govern spelling, grammar, and reading. This master linguist understood the power of words, their definitions, and the need for precise word usage in communication to maintain independence. Webster used the Bible as the foundation for his definitions thus making the 1828 Dictionary a work that contains more Biblical definitions than any other reference work.\n\nThis app is an essential tool for students of all ages."

      "label": "The Hebrew Bible iPhone application is designed for reading/studying the Hebrew Bible in either Hebrew, Aramaic (Torah only), or in a parallel translation format combining Hebrew and another language (at present, either English or French). It is also useful as a tool for improving one's knowledge of Biblical Hebrew and Biblical Aramaic. It is comprised of five main components:\n\n1. Bible: The Hebrew Bible is accessible in several different versions (a default version is selected via iPhone preferences and it is possible to change versions while running the application as well). The first six versions listed below are included in the App, the other versions can be either accessed over the Internet or downloaded (at no additional charge). The versions that are available are: \n    * Hebrew (cantillation)\n    * Hebrew (vowels)\n    * Hebrew (no vowels)\n    * Hebrew/English (cantillation)\n    * Hebrew/English (vowels)\n    * Hebrew/English (no vowels)\n    * Hebrew/French\n    * English\n    * Hebrew Torah (commentary)\n    * Aramaic Torah (vowels)\n    * Aramaic Torah (no vowels)\n\nWhen reading a book or chapter (regardless of the version selected), it is also possible to listen to the Hebrew version of the selected book/chapter being read by pressing the \"Play\" button at the top of the page. The audio readings are pronounced in Sephardi-style Hebrew. In additon to a \"Book\"-based reading approach, it is possible to also toggle to a \"Parashah\"-based approach (a Parashah is the weekly synagogue Torah/Haftarah reading). Both Ashkenazi and Sephardi Parashah readings are supported. While reading the Hebrew and Hebrew/English versions, if you touch any Hebrew word, you will be presented with a pop-up English definition. From the popup, it is also possible to display a list of all the verses in the Hebrew Bible that contain that word. \n\n2. Words: This is useful for learning more about specific Hebrew words and for discovering related words. One can lookup words by \"Root\" by selecting the first two letters of the Hebrew word root. A listing will be displayed of all Hebrew words (and, optionally, Aramaic words and/or proper names) that begin with those two letters. Once the list is displayed, touching a word will open up a further level of detail about the selected word (and, optionally, all verses that contain that word or the BDB page for that word). Alternatively, one can use the \"Translate\" function to translate words or sentences or go directly to the word detail via the \"Strongs\" number lookup function. There is also a word search facility.\n\n3. Topics: There are links to key topics (over 200 people/places/things) in the Wikipedia online encyclopedia. One can access topics by Bible book, by \"Meta\" topics, and a consolidated list of all topics.\n\n4. Maps: There are maps of almost every location (over 1,000 locations) mentioned in the Hebrew Bible. It is possible to display multiple different locations on a map and to clear previously selected locations from a map. One can access Maps by Bible book or a consolidated list of all maps. By selecting a location on the map and touching the \"callout detail disclosure\" symbol (the \"right arrow\"), one can see a listing of all verses in the Hebrew Bible that mention that location.\n\n5. BDB: The Brown–Driver–Briggs Hebrew Lexicon is probably the most commonly used Biblical Hebrew Lexicon. A complete copy of this lexicon is accessible from within the application. In additon, individual pages  can be displayed via the word lookup functionality.\n\nAn Internet connection is required in order to use some content in this application but most core functionality is maintained locally."

What makes this app unique is the step-by-step search function on the basis of what you see, helping to identify the bird you have just spotted. Each species is accompanied with a map of its distribution, a textual description, photographs and conservation status, together with order, family and Latin name. The Chilean and Argentinian names are given for each bird, and all the texts are in English, Spanish and Italian.\nAn ideal app for experts and simple tourists alike: birds in Patagonia are far less shy than in Europe or North America, so you can get much closer!\n\nDESCRIPTION\nOur aim has not been to produce a comprehensive, technical birdwatching field guide for the expert birdwatcher, but a selection of the most representative and fascinating birds of Patagonia.\nOur guide aims to be of interest and use to a broader and less expert public, as well as to the keen birdwatcher.\nThere are clear photographs of each species of bird, together with a distribution map and non-technical descriptive text.\nWith regard to seabirds, we have included only those that may be seen on or near the coast. In a guide intended for visitors to Patagonia, there seemed little point including pelagic birds that may be Argentinian or Chilean in the sense that they cross the waters of these countries, but are rarely or never actually seen in Patagonia itself.\n\nHOW TO USE THIS APP\nYou can choose to see the birds listed alphabetically or select them by name, family or order.\nA search facility helps you identify the bird you have spotted.\nSimply tap in the details you have noted about its appearance and behaviour and the app will show you the possible bird(s) matching those criteria, in order of probability.\nTap on the name to see a description of that bird and its conservation status.\nTap on the world symbol for a map of its range.\nTap on the thumbnail to show the photographs of the bird described.\nTapping on the habitat button on the top-level menu provides a description of the main habitats of Patagonia, together with photographs."

The range of each species is described in detail (instead of range maps). In addition to the birds‘ geographical ranges, the altitudinal zones which they inhabit are given. The zones and their limits are:\n\n• Tropical Zone:\n  sea level to 4500–5000 ft (1,400 to 1,500 m)\n  \n• Subtropical Zone:\n  4500–5000 to 7500–8500 ft (1,400–1,500 m to 2,300–2,600 m)\n  \n• Temperate Zone:\n  7500–8500 to 9500–11,500 ft (2,300–2,600 m to 2,900–3,500 m)\n  \n• Páramo or Puna Zone:\n  9500–11,500 ft (2,900–3,500 m) to snow line \n\nThe current app version contains the descriptions and images of 1,766 bird species found in Colombia. Moreover, an ornithological dictionary (English, French, Spanish, Portuguese) and detailed illustrations and drawings of bird anatomy are included.\n\nThe app features a modern, intuitive graphical user interface with functions for searching the birds‘ names and in the full text, switching the sorting language for the listings and sort by English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, or the scientific (Latin) notation. In addition to the bird descriptions, the name of the birds in many languages can be displayed.\n\nAnother clever feature is the Field Note Editor, which allows you to record your bird sightings with predefined locations settings (which can be overwritten by the user) and many other commonly recorded data items.\n\nApart from using the optional backup and restore functions for Field Notes and Favorites, the app runs completely offline and there is no need for an internet connection during usage in the field.\n\nAs with The Birds of South America, which contains more than 3,000 birds found on the entire continent, also The Birds of Colombia runs on any iOS device and can exchange Field Notes and Favorites list between identical app versions on two or more devices via Bluetooth."

      "label": "Although the FAIRtax Calculator is designed for anyone who wants to know how the FAIRtax would help them financially, it is primarily aimed at providing FAIRtax advocates a quick and easy tool, with which to show everyone from the man on the street to members of Congress, exactly how much any given family, of a particular size and annual retail spending, would pay in FAIRtax, once it becomes law.\n\nThe current version of the calculator is based on the text of \"The FAIRtax Act of 2021\" (H.R.25) and the published Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines for 2021. Each year, as the new federal poverty guidelines are published, this calculator will be updated to reflect those guidelines. (That data release usually occurs in early January.) Also, should the wording of the FAIRtax Act be changed in its introduction in a future session of Congress, this calculator will be updated to reflect any relevant changes.\n\nIt should be noted that, since tax collection and rebate payments under the FAIRtax are all automatic (i.e. no federal filings for individuals), this calculator is FOR DEMONSTRATION PURPOSES ONLY. It is only to demonstrate what automatically happens “behind the scenes”. Under the FAIRtax, the only form you have to file is a one-page annual statement, attesting to the size and composition of your family.\n\nThe FAIRtax calculator asks for the only four pieces of information, required to determine what you will pay in tax, under the FAIRtax. Those items are, 1) the family’s estimated annual spending on new retail products and services, 2) the number of adults in the home, 3) the number of children in the home, and 4) the region of the USA in which the family lives (Alaska and Hawaii have a higher cost of living, which would affect their rebate) - all done with scroll wheels. Selectable spending levels range in $1,000 increments from $0 to $9,999,000. Other wheels allow you to select the number of adults and children in the home and either the Lower 48 States, Alaska, or Hawaii. When you release each wheel, the tax total and tax rate numbers at the bottom of the screen are instantly updated.\n\nThe numbers at the bottom of the screen reflect the FAIRtax total that is equivalent to every item included on your current FORM1040 (income tax, FICA, Medicare, etc.). That tax level also covers both your personal payroll tax (7.65%) and employer portion of the payroll tax (7.65%), along with all federal income tax that is currently embedded in the price of products and services that you purchase, at retail.\n\nAlso included in this app is a screen that shows the underlying equations, used in the FAIRtax Calculator, in a scrolling page. Calculating the FAIRtax really is so simple that it can be accurately described in one page of text.\n\nIf you are a FAIRtax proponent, you'll appreciate the ability to almost instantly answer the question that all FAIRtax proponents have heard many times, \"How much will I pay in FAIRtax?\" In fact, with ease and speed of the FAIRtax calculator, you can even encourage others to try to find any set of family dynamics for which the FAIRtax does not represent a benefit. As fast as someone gives you new numbers, you can show them the FAIRtax for that family, both as a percentage rate and in dollars.\n\nAlthough this calculator is aimed at FAIRtax promoters, we invite FAIRtax detractors to try it. We invite you to play around with the numbers. Then compare the totals with what the same family would pay today, under the income tax. Then, you be the judge…"

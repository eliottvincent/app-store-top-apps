      "label": "Used by beginners through Major Championship winners on the PGA Tour, and validated by an Independent Scientific Study by the Departments of Physics and Biomechanics at Yale University.\n\nThe Tour Tempo Total Game allows you to learn how to correctly integrate the Tempo of the Tour Pros into your golf swing. Over 100,000 golfers worldwide, including Major Championship winners on the PGA Tour, have improved their games by using Tour Tempo.  \n\n\"In all the reviews I've written for MyGolfSpy (a number now pushing up on 100), I'd only given one perfect score. Now Tour Tempo can be added to that most-elite company. Tour Tempo is scientifically proven, it's easy to use, and it will help you in every facet of the game.\" \n— GolfSpy Matt: http://www.mygolfspy.com/tour-tempo-review\n\n\"It will be the best thing that you will ever do for your game.\" \n— Pat Dempsey, 2011 RE/MAX World Long Drive Grand Champion 55+\n\n\"You will get better right away! When you synch your swing to that of the Tour Pros with Tour Tempo, you’ll get better right now!\" \n— Dan Rooney, Folds of Honor\n\n\"The Unified Theory of Tempo\" \n— Golf Digest \n\n\"No one has ever come up with a way to teach Tempo until now.\"\n— Travel + Leisure Golf \n\nBased on the international best selling golf book, Tour Tempo. The book outlines and explains the discovery of a specific mathematical ratio regarding the elapsed time of the backswing and the elapsed time of the downswing of the Tour Pros. The Tour Tempo System is simple and easy to learn. All you do is react to three scientifically spaced musical notes. These musical notes alert you to start your takeaway, start your downswing, and then the third note lines you up with impact. It’s just that easy - you literally download the app, turn it on, grab a club and start swinging to the Tempo of the Tour Pros.\n\nLONG GAME\nThe Long Game Tones will teach you how to swing with the tempo ratio exhibited by the Tour Pros. We measured the time of their backswings and downswings by counting how many frames of video each part took. The magic ratio on full swings turned out to be three parts backswing to one part downswing. Tones are provided for each of the following frame ratios of Tour Tempo - 18/6, 21/7, 24/8 & 27/9. The Tour Tempo Tones have a clear purpose. They establish the intrinsic tempo of the golf swing in your subconscious mind. Once this is accomplished, you will not have to think about tempo while playing. This is what the Tour Pros have already done. You are about to acquire that same ability.\n\nSHORT GAME\nThe Total Game App also contains the Short Game Tones of 14/7, 16/8, 18/9 & 20/10. After the publication of Tour Tempo, John Novosel studied the short game swings of the top touring pros, and discovered that virtually all of them employ a 2 to 1 swing ratio on or around the greens - a different Tempo than the 3 to 1 ratio of the Long Game. This is another reason why the game of golf is so hard to master.      \n\nTEMPO TRACKS\nThe Tempo Tracks are an easy way to integrate Tour Tempo into your daily routine. One of the best ways to use the Tracks is to listen to them while driving to the course before a round of golf. The more you listen to them, the more the Tour Tempo rhythm will be ingrained into your Golf Swing. \n\nFOCUS TRACKS\nThe Focus Tracks are revolutionary relaxation songs that contain the Tones of Tour Tempo. Each Track has a Part II that has binaural tones embedded in the music to get your brain into an optimum state for concentration. This optimum state is more commonly known to athletes as “Being in the Zone.”\n\nVIDEOS\nThe videos give a complete explanation of the Tones and how to use them to immediately and dramatically improve your Total Game.  \n\nDISCOUNT\nThe app is your first step towards a more powerful, consistent golf game, and that is why we are giving you a discount from our Tour Tempo Shop. On the 'Info' screen you will find a one-time discount code good for $10 off on a future purchase at TourTempo.com and TourTempo.eu."

The app gives you duration, distance, speed and altitude as well as your exact position and track lines on a map while tracking.\n\nThe web site stores your tracks in an archive under your account that enables you to log in and view and edit your tracks. Using the app, you can be as anonymous as you like since you track under an Alias, and you can even set the tracks to be private (not listed or searchable on locatoweb.com). \n\nThe app only records your position when a track has been set up and started and lasts until you stop it. It is frequently used to track bicycle rides, road trips, hiking trips and other outdoor adventures where you want to show your friends and family where you are, or to simply track your adventures for your own pleasure.\n\nThere is also a safety aspect of using LocaToWeb. If you have the track running and something happens, your wife, husband and friends can see the exact location of where you are. Maybe you are riding your bike and falls off hitting your head, or you just want to be safe when walking home alone at night. \n\nKey features:\n\n- Share your position to web in real time\n- Monitor duration, distance, speed and altitude\n- See your exact position and track line on a map\n- Capture and upload photos while tracking\n- Set up race groups that tracks several participants\n- Choose your units system (metric/imperial)\n- Possible to keep the screen alive while tracking\n- Resume a track that has been stopped\n- View and edit your archived tracks anytime on the web site\n- Just install and track, no registering is required\n\nNote that continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

By freedivers, for freedivers, our freedive apnea trainer helps you with static apnea tables and lung capacity training so you can effectively increase the time when diving underwater.\r\nSee why STAmina Apnea Trainer is one of the best apnea apps to improve the breath-holding time for freediving, scuba diving and spearfishing, as well as surfing, running, and other water sports with 6 different apnea tables types.\n\n\r\n■ FREEDIVING & SPEARFISHING APNEA TRAINER FEATURES:\n\n\r\n◉ 6 APNEA TABLE OPTIONS \r\nSTAmina Apnea Trainer can create / generate custom apnea (exercises that are automatically created based on the maximum breath-hold and match the user’s level) or let you select from the following customizable table types:\r\n\r\n- O2 deprivation table – accustoms a body to lower oxygen levels. This is achieved by increasing the amount of time that you hold your breath on each attempt, while the resting time is fixed.\r\n\r\n- CO2 Tolerance table – helps a body to adapt to high carbon dioxide levels. This is achieved by decreasing the length of resting time between fixed breath-hold periods.\r\n\r\n- Wonka table – a variation of CO2 tables. Apnea timer starts after the first contraction, the rest time takes one breath.\r\n\r\n- Mix table – tables where apnea time increases and rest time decreases with each round.\r\n\r\n- Custom table – allows mixing of different approaches to create a custom training, thus generating the most effective training program.\r\n\r\n- Pranayama – a breathing technique to decrease stress in the body and relax the nervous system.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ APPLE HEALTH SYNCRONIZATION \n\n\r\n\r\n◉ PERSONALIZED TRAINING WITH VARYING DIFFICULTY\r\nWhen you start working with the application, you set your personal record in breath holding. Based on this data, the app will offer a personalized training program with exercises of 3 difficulty levels to choose from: easy, normal, and hard.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ PERSONALIZED EXERCISE SETTINGS \r\nEach exercise can be edited by setting your own number of repetitions, breath hold time, rest time, etc.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ TRAINING REMINDERS \r\nGet the notification to start your apnea training. Set a reminder in the apnea diver app for the day and the time & get a notification to do a breath holding training session.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ PERSONAL STATISTICS AND DETAILED TRAINING HISTORY\r\nAll your workouts and exercises are recorded in the freedive trainer app to track the detailed progress of each training.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ VOICE GUIDANCE\r\nTraining may be accompanied by voice guidance with male/female voices recorded by professional voice actors. STAmina supports English, French, Russian voice guidance.\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n◉ HEART RATE AND OXYGEN SATURATION TRACKING\r\nTrack your heart rate while doing breath holding exercises (a compatible HR monitor or pulse-oximeter is required) \n\n\r\n\r\n◉ CONTRACTIONS TRACKING \r\nUse our freedive trainer to track unlimited contractions, analyse captured data after exercises\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ CLOUD SYNC / BACKUP\r\nAccess your data on multiple devices and easily restore it in case you switch devices/phones.\n\n\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\nStamina Apnea Trainer allows training breath hold effectively for anyone who cares about all kinds of diving including:\r\n> beginner or professional freedivers;\r\nspearfishers;\r\n> scuba divers to learn how to dive longer on one tank;\r\n> surfers in case of unexpected breath hold;\r\n> underwater sports athletes such as underwater rugby, hockey, etc.\r\n> runners who want to train breath holding & high tolerance to CO2 while running\r\n\r\n_______\r\nInfo https://getstamina.app/\r\nContact https://www.facebook.com/staminamobile/\r\nSupport hello@squarecrowdapps.com"

      "label": "Avy savvy backcountry skiers and riders know that three things count when it comes to the terrain’s influence on avalanches: the slope, the elevation, and the (compass) aspect. And the Avalanche Inclinometer delivers all three. Sure, you can find plenty of inclinometer apps (also known as clinometers) that are designed for carpenters, but Steve's Avalanche Inclinometer is meant for people who spend time in avalanche terrain. \n\nThis app shows the slope, elevation, and aspect in BIG FONTS which are perfect for tired eyes in stormy (or bright-and-too-sunny) weather. And it doesn’t display a gaggle of tiny buttons and widgets to decipher when you should be skiing.\n\nYou can sight across a slope by holding your phone parallel to the slope, or you can sight up or down a slope by sighting along the long-edge of your phone like a gunsight. (Through-the-camera sighting is nifty when the light is just right, but it often isn't.)\n\nWhen you have your phone aligned with the slope, a single tap on the screen will lock the data so you can read it. The Avalanche Inclinometer will even speak to you as you’re measuring the steepness so you won’t need to look at the screen. And the BIG inclinometer dial changes colors based on the slope which provides instant feedback on how the steepness of the terrain is contributing to the likelihood of an avalanche.\n\nAfter measuring the slope, you can tap a single button to share your current GPS location, the slope in degrees, and the elevation. The email includes kml and gpx waypoint files, and a link that will let you quickly see the location in any browser. You can enter the email address one time and the Avalanche Inclinometer will remember it for next time. Less typing; more skiing.\n\nThe Avalanche Inclinometer isn’t free, but apps don’t grow on trees. To buy this app you’ll spend less than buying a beer at a ski resort—think of it as buying Steve a beer!\n\nIn addition to the Avalanche Inclinometer, it is important that you take an avy class, pay attention to the avalanche red flags, use good route finding techniques, and practice your avalanche rescue skills frequently"

Prolonged writing to a flash drive shortness its life span.\n\n+ PRIVACY\nThe app does not in any way collect or send private data or require login. The app is self contained working on your device without any need to contact other services or use internet connection.\n\n\n\nWHAT CRITICS SAY (WITH VIDEO):\n\n[Professional physical education teacher Jarrod Robinson]\n\n“Over the years, I’ve spoken to thousands of PhysEd teachers about the app BaM Video Delay. It’s a complete game-changer that takes what used to be possible with expensive and complicated systems and makes it a reality for everyone”\n\nhttps://thepegeek.com/2016/03/raising-bar-bam-video-delay/\n\n\n[australiancurriculumtfel.edublogs.org]\n\n“The app has great potential to be used on a regular basis in physical education classes as a formative assessment tool.”\n\nhttp://australiancurriculumtfel.edublogs.org/2015/11/11/formative-assessment-using-bam-video-delay-app-in-pe/\n\n\n\nUSER REVIEWS:\n\nBy Kbone2000\n5/5 Great app!\nEvery coach needs this app. Immediate feedback for players and a great way for self analysis.\n\nBy James McDermott\n5/5 Great app!\nWorks for what I need, nice that you can have a delay rather than asking someone to record each time.\n\nBy awholelottatry\n5/5 A great technical training tool for sport and fitness\nThis is exactly what I was looking for! Needed it to perfect technique in Crossfit Olympic lifting. Every technical sport could use this valuable tool.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n\nEver wanted to learn a new move? \nBe it for professional dancing, gymnastics, golf, basketball, tennis, martial arts, breakdance, strike a pose or other use.\n\nA mirror is nice but it's hard to move and look the same time, sometimes even impossible when not facing forward. \n\nA video camera is OK but it is a hassle with all the start, stop, rewind, positioning and other.\n \nSo in the end you don't use either, give up on learning something new and move on with your life.\n\n\n\"Bust a Move Video Delay\" solves these problems.\nIt gives you an easy to use tool with quick feedback. You see what you just did, so you can correct it, try again, look again, correct ... and so on.\n\nAlso, after the initial setup, no interaction is needed so you can focus on training without any distractions.  \n\n\n\nSO WHAT DOES A “VIDEO DELAY” DO ?\n\nIt continuously shows you what just happened seconds ago. There is no alternating record or play phase, just continuous playback but with a given delay. This way you get fast and easy accessible video feedback. \n\nAlso no tapping, rewinding or other interactions are needed. Once set up it works hands free so you can focus on your moves.\n\nNow there are just two easy steps:\n1. BUST A MOVE\n(do what you want to learn)\n2. LOOK & LEARN\n(see what you just did and what's wrong)\n\nThis way you get instantaneous feedback so you can quickly learn on your mistakes and get better in no time. \n\n\n\nFEATURES:\n\n- \"hands free\" continuous playback but with a delay\n- up to Full HD at 30 fps and HD at 60 fps\n- universal app for both iPhone/iPod and iPad\n- delays from 1 second up to 6 minutes\n- uses device memory instead of its flash drive\n- up to 4 independent views so you can see yourself 4 times in a row\n- slow motion and pause to analyse the video\n- export as video\n- AirPlay and HDMI TV cable support\n- auto hiding interface controls\n- \"Live View\" for easy positioning of the camera and setup\n- front to rear camera switch\n- horizontal flip\n- x2 Zoom with panning\n- exposure and focus setting\n- and a manual, just in case"

As the perfect mum or dad watching all your kids' Ice Hockey games, be the one setting the ambiance for the team AND being where the heater is! Talk to the scoreboard guru and offer to play music during the games. Nothing simpler, get the app, setup your playlist with the perfect start time for each song, and plug your phone to the rink's audio system. That's it! All the kids will vote for you to play at all the games now. You will see, the time at the rink will fly and you will be looking forward to the next game like never before and you will never freeze again. I wrote that app for my son, it changed the way I see rinks now. The team was even convincing home teams we were visiting to let me play music for the travel games!   \n\nThis is the perfect Dad's app for Ice Hockey Entertainment music management and playlist. Play Pump up Songs, Face Off, and Crowd Power Up to cheer up for your team. \n\n24 songs included in this version of the app. These songs by Audionautix and Kevin MacLeod are licensed under Creative Commons Attribution license. The 36 buttons of the app can be reprogrammed with any of your own songs from your iTunes library. (Horns, Organs, ...). \n\nThe latest addition is a full screen of your best team teams' Horns! It comes included! If I am missing your favorite team, contact me on instagram @HockeyDJApp.\n\n12 suggested links to iTunes titles which will pump up your kid's team.\n\nEvery button is customizable and can be set to point to the songs you own in your iTunes Local Library (No need for iTunes Cloud Subscription). You can purchase more screens if you want, up to 15 extra screens giving you a total of 216 customizable buttons.\n\nThe cool thing about the buttons is that you can set you own starting time per song, placing the play button at the best moment of the song to have a maximum effect on your DJ skills and for the please of the parents and players at the rink.\n\nThe \"Horn\" and \"1min Left in the game\" buttons are also customizable, and now you can recall the previous song after playing a goal announcement.\n\nVia InApp purchase, you can record your own voice for quick announcements and set on the \"1min Left Button\" (or on any other buttons).\n\nWith additional inApp purchases, you can play announcements for Penalties, by selecting : The voice, the player, the team, the time and type of penalty. Then you just need to press the ready and play button. With version 5.0 and above, you can also record player roster names. This will be played on demand when you announce penalties. You can even use it to record your own announcements and play them on the rink speakers as you would play any songs from the app.\n\nDisclaimer : Copyrighted songs (120 suggested) are not included in the Apps. This latest version will let you use your iTunes Cloud Music Subscription to select your songs. From the Settings screen, you can find a button to pre-load each screen with specific startup time for each song."

Wouldn’t it be great to be able to dive deeply with one big breath and take incredible pictures for your friends at home? The Apnea Trainer makes it possible! By using it to train three times a week, you can quickly double your underwater time.\n\nThis is the same training principle used by apnea divers. It’s based on a yoga technique which strengthens the diaphragm muscles allowing you to fill your lungs with more oxygen and releasing more carbon dioxide while exhaling. The system is relatively simple and depends on finding the right time intervals which are provided by the program, thus letting you relax and concentrate on your breathing. This will guarantee maximum training success.\nThe program will also come in handy just before the actual dive since a pranayama mode is already included. The Apnea Trainer will help you keep your whole body calm and give you the perfect preparation for those amazing, long-lasting dives. \n\n\nFeatures:\n+ Training to improve free diving time\n\n+ Pranayama mode to calm your body before diving or snorkeling\n\n+ Custom time settings for pro divers\n\n+ Optical and Audio instructions\n\n+ Easy to use interface\n\nUpdated user interface with the help of Bjoern Maser by www.minimalist.ch."

      "label": "The most advanced sports timer in the AppStore! \nFeatured by Apple in the TV-ad \"Strength\". \n\nSprintTimer is a unique sports timer and photo finish app that employs the same techniques as the fully automatic timing equipment (FAT) used at the Olympics. Start the timer and point the camera towards the finish line. The app creates an image where you can scroll to get the time for each competitor with a 0.01 s accuracy*. SprintTimer also includes a motion/human-activated Video Finish for longer races and a Start Sender for wirelessly controlling SprintTimer from another device.\n\nSprintTimer is used by coaches, teachers, and athletes all over the world for practice and competition in, for example, track & field, cycling, skiing, speed skating, car racing, rowing, kayaking, horses or greyhound racing. \n\nSprintTimer has several advantages over a manual stopwatch: \n- One person can time all participants\n- Higher accuracy*\n- Easier to determine the order\n- The image and the results can be saved\n- Can operate \"hands-free\" when started\n- The timer can be started manually, with a sound, or remotely from another device\n\n*See webpage: sprinttimer.app/accuracy\n\n——— Reviews and Comments ———\n\n\"Without a doubt the best App available on the market for sprinters and coaches who want accurate timing to see their development.\"\nspeedendurance.com\n\n\"AMAZING\"\nthepegeek.com\n\n\"Amazing app for physical education teachers or coaches!  I have used it for timing during our track and field, speed quickness & agility, fitness testing, & many more units.  It is very accurate and easy to use and gets the job done quickly!  A must-have!\"\nmertonphysed.weebly.com\n\n \"The app is very professionally set up and you can very easily capture your whole Track event.\"\nwww.melhamada.com\n\n\"Very useful app for measuring and/or verifying close finishes to track and field or road races.\"\nphysedreview.weebly.com\n\nSatisfied users from all over the world:\n- Brilliant.  A fantastic app for use in school athletics lessons\n- Amazing. This application is awesome and the results are really accurate.\n- What a brilliant app! Our £9k photo finish camera broke down and this app was a real lifesaver and worth way more than £1.50! Highly recommended.\n- This app is wonderful. We use it to time all our meets.\n- This is a great app and it is getting better from release to release\n- Nice, nice, nice! Using it for our youth track team. Love it! 5 stars!\n- Exactly what I needed - Fantastic app\n- Thank you so much for developing this amazing app just when we ran out of options.\n- Congratulations on developing a really clever and useful app.\n- Love what you did with the SprintTimer app.\n\n——— In-App Purchases and Subscriptions ———\n\nThe Start Sender and Results Manager features require the purchase of SprintTimer Pro, available as a subscription at $4.99 per year. There is a 2 weeks free trial period.\n\nShould you choose to subscribe to SprintTimer Pro, the purchase will be charged to your Apple ID account. The subscription will be auto-renewed 24 hours prior to the end of the period. You can manage it from the user settings in iTunes after purchasing it, and you will also be able to cancel the auto-renewing subscription from there.\n\nIf you purchase a new SprintTimer Pro subscription during a free trial you will forfeit any free trial remaining from your first subscription.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy: https://sprinttimer.se/privacy\n\n\nIcon runners made by Freepik from Flaticon.com"

      "label": "Flyskyhy forms your flight instrument during flight and shows all information you need for that. You get the normal data like altitude, climb rate, ground speed, and glide angle. But it also calculates and shows the current wind direction and strength, very important for your safety.\n\nA moving and rotating map shows your current flying position and flight trail. It indicates where you have gone up (in a thermal), and where you have had faster than normal decline. With that, you can easily find back that thermal that you lost. The map also shows the nearest known landing spots, and whether they are reachable by normal glide, given your current altitude and wind direction.\n\nIntegration with Bluetooth varios SensBox, FlyNet, GoFly iPico, XC-Tracer, BlueFlyVario, or SkyDrop gives accurate altitude and lift information. That turns your iPhone into an full-fletched GPS-vario, including vario tones.\n\nThe app makes a full log of your flight, that can be analyzed afterwards. Besides normal data like start and landing positions, duration of flight, and an altitude graph of the flight, Flyskyhy also calculates the scoring distances for you. So you can immediately see whether you have broken that FAI triangle record.\n\nYour live location is reported on livetrack24.com or loctome.com if you desire, so anybody can follow your flight while it is happening. If you are flying together with friends, then their location is shown on your map during your flight. So you never have to wonder anymore whether they are in front of or behind you.\n\nThe flight display has multiple screens which are all fully configurable. You can move all elements to other spots, delete and add elements, and resize them.\n\nThrough in-app purchases, the app also supports airspaces and waypoints.\n\nThe app is optimised for paragliding and hang gliders, but can be used with all  kinds of airsports.\n\nMain features during the flight;\n• Altitude, climb rate, ground speed, air speed, direction, glide angle and many more\n• Wind strength and direction\n• Moving map of the flying area\n• Spots where you have had lift, great for thermal coring\n• Shows whether you can still reach a landing spot with the current altitude and wind\n• Live tracking of your flight on livetrack24.com or loctome.com\n• Shows live location of your friends during flight\n\nAfter the flight:\n• Full logbook of all your flights\n• Basic flight data like start/landing, duration, height difference, distance flown, and many more\n• Calculation of 5-points, open triangle, and FAI triangle distances\n• Graph of altitude and climb rate\n• Signed IGC and KML log files of flights\n• Transfer the log to iTunes or send by email\n• Upload the flight directly to XContest, ParaglidingForum, DHV-XC, and other Leonardo servers\n• Open flight in Google Earth on the iPhone\n• Replay the flight and relive it!\n\nBy purchasing the Waypoints Extension you get access to:\n• A fully zoomable and scrollable map with the waypoints and optimised route. The map also shows start and landing spots, as well as restricted airspaces (with the Airspace Extension)\n• Enter new waypoints, either on the map or by specifying the parameters\n• Full route support with start time, goal, entry/exit points, etc. \n• Many instruments to guide you along the route\n• Visible and audible indication when a waypoint has been reached\n• Complete waypoints organiser\n• Import and export of various waypoint file formats\n\nBy purchasing the Airspace Extension you get access to:\n• Airspaces of 30 countries\n• Display of airspaces on the map with configurable colors and formats\n• Display of your vertical position w.r.t. airspaces\n• Visible and audible warnings when approaching and entering an airspace\n• Shows local airspaces by touching a spot on the map\n\nNote: a live internet connection is required for live tracking of your and your friends locations\nNote: continuous GPS and screen usage makes the battery drain faster than normal"

Validation published on the Journal of Strength & Conditioning Research and Journal of Sports Sciences*****\n***Featured by Apple under ‘Best New Apps’ in 100+ countries***\n***The only app which calculates the force-velocity profile using the groundbreaking Samozino’s method***\n \nMy Jump 2 is the first app scientifically developed to measure your jump height. With a great design and validated by sport scientists, My Jump 2 is as reliable as a 10000$ force platform. Scientifically probed!\n\n------------------------------\n \nPierre Samozino (PhD, sport scientist, University of Savoy): “My Jump 2 makes possible the determination of the jump height with a high accuracy, which has been validated in very recent scientific study. The other, and I think the main added value of this app is to propose the determination of the Force-Velocity-Power profile of each athlete and its own imbalance between force and velocity qualities. Very useful to optimize your strength training and improve your explosive performances.”\n\nJean-Benoit Morin (PhD, sport scientist, University of Nice): “My Jump 2 is the cutting edge, scientifically validated and most practical application to measure athletes vertical jumping performance, and the only one to include the complete \"Optimal Force-Velocity Profile\" analysis we recently validated. I'm using it with athletes, students, and research subjects. The entire Jumping Force-Velocity-Power and Optimal F-V Profile approach in your pocket!”\n \n------------------------------\n \nMy Jump 2 gives you advanced information of your jumps using the camera on your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad. Just record a jump, select accurately its take off and landing and lets My Jump do its magic. My Jump 2 calculates the height, flight time, velocity, force and power of your vertical jumps. Also, it gives you the contact time, vertical stiffness and reactive strength index (RSI) of your Drop Jumps. Moreover, it allows you to calculate your Force-Velocity profile using Samozino's method. Complete analysis of your jumps right on your hand!\n \nFEATURES:\n \n• Accurate measurement of your vertical jumps. Scientifically demonstrated!\n• Calculate the force-velocity profile using the groundbreaking Samozino’s method. You can know your maximal theoretical force, velocity, power and how far you are from your optimal capabilities! You can even get information about which quality (force or velocity) you should work to increase your explosive performance.\n• Record stunnig slowmo videos up to 240fps or import as much as you like from your camera roll.\n• Different jump types: countermovement jump (CMJ), squat jump (SJ), drop jump (DJ), CMJ free arms, horizontal jumps and repeated jump test!\n• Annotate the external load used (CMJ & SJ) or the height of the box (DJ) to organize your best performances in different categories.\n• Multi-user. My Jump 2 allows you to create as many users as you want. Monitor all your team on your iDevice!\n• iCloud sync (iOS 13+)\n• History. Record as many jumps as you want for each user created. With My Jump 2 you can analyze the evolution of your performance during time. You can even observe exactly how much you have improved!\n• Export your data to Excel, Numbers, Google Drive and more!\n• Beautiful, intuitive like design.\n• Universal app: purchase once and install it on your iPhone, iPad and Mac (10.15+)\n \nNote: My Jump 2 works better with slow-motion videos.\n \nMY JUMP 2, A JUMP PLATFORM RIGHT ON YOUR HAND!"

      "label": "The TRACT Optics Impact Ballistics mobile application takes the guesswork out of long-range shooting and provides data to help the most experienced shooter as well as the beginner or novice. This mobile application is one of the most comprehensive databases of information available today. With virtually every modern ammunition manufacturer’s information listed shooters can match any TRACT rifle scope reticle to their exact cartridge. Simply select your scope, then your ammo/bullet the program will calculate the bullet drop information as it pertains to your reticle automatically. If you cannot find your particular round of ammunition in the program, simply add the Ballistic Coefficient (B.C.) and Muzzle Velocity to the program and you will be good to go. With the ability to import current weather conditions the Impact program will provide up to date Bullet Drop Compensation to help you make accurate shots in the field or at the range. While the mobile application is designed to provide ballistic date without an internet connection, when the user has an internet connection, they are able to access our complete library of videos, articles, and blogs. Simply navigate to the Learn section of the app and you can access the Getting Started section for Rifle Scopes, Binoculars and Spotting Scopes as well as Pro Shooting Tips with videos detailing How To videos showing how to maximize the performance of your optic. You can even shop our complete line of Optics and Accessories right from the App. This app will be continually updated with new ammunition information, new product releases and videos. Selectable options include Meters or Yards, Drag Table, Spin Drift, Sight Height, Printable Dope and BDC cards, the ability to compare loads, atmospheric conditions (manual entry or automatic import), wind direction, sight setting/zero calculator and much more. The program is capable of providing ballistic data out to 2,500 yards. The BDC card allows the shooter to print out a “cheat sheet” that can show the bullet drop at each magnification (for Second Focal Plane scopes) The Dope card provides velocity, energy, path, drop, wind drift, time of flight, # of click value and MOA or MRAD info in 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 yard increments. Weather/Atmospheric conditions can be automatically imported thanks to our direct link to World Weather Online, or you can manually enter the Temperature, Altitude, Barometric Pressure and Humidity through the Conditions section. The conditions section also allows the user to enter Bullet Wind Drift information such as wind speed and direction and provide data in inches, MOA or MRAD. The sight settings section is a great resource for shooters who would like to zero their rifle at a further distance then they are able to shoot. For example, if a user only has access to a 100-yard range but would like his rifle to be zeroed at 200 yards, the Sight Setting section will show the user where his bullet needs to impact on a 100-yard target to be zeroed at 200 yards. Our goal for this app is that it provides you with a comprehensive resource for everything and anything related to TRACT Optics…Where you Belong."

Determining the solunar period is therefore useful for activities such as birdwatching, fishing or hunting. There are two major and two minor solunar periods each day. The time at which each solunar occurs varies depending on the date and on your geographical location.\n\nThe app helps you to determine the solunar period and expected animal activity index (where 6-point is when animals are most active). It also tells you the exact sunrise, sunset, sun transit, moon rise, moon set, and moon transit times, alone with moon phase. The app can utilize your iPhone's build-in GPS to obtain your geographical location. In case you are using iTouch or without GPS signal, the app also accepts user input of longitude and latitude. \n\n\nFEATURES:\n.Locations: GPS or Manual Entry\n.Major & Minor Periods\n.Activity Index\n.Moonrise / Moonset Times\n.Moon Phase Data\n.Sunrise / Sunset Times\n.Sun Transit\n.Moon Transit\n.Day / Week View\n.Any Date\n.Any Location - Worldwide\n\nNo network is needed.

      "label": "Measuring your car's torque and horsepower has never been easier, now that you can do it with the help of your mobile device and this digital Dyno. You just need to open your datalog of a pull, and Log Dyno will do the rest. \n\nYou can send your CSV file from your email, browser, or any app to Log Dyno which will Open the datalog from the app right away and give you a measurement, or you can save your CSV file to the Log Dyno folder in your Files app, for easy access from the in-app file browser.\n\nYou can use any CSV or MSL file that contains RPM data which is needed to accurately measure Horsepower and Torque.\n\nFrom the torque curve and gear ratios, the app will also recommend optimal gear shift points for each gear to ensure maximum acceleration. This makes sure you know when to shift, so you always have the most possible power at the wheels.\n\nCorrections:\n●\tUncorrected\n●\tSAE J1349\n●\tSTD\n●\tDIN 70020\n●\tISO 1585\n\nPower Units:\n●\tWHP\n●\tBHP\n●\tPS\n●\tKW\n\nTorque Units:\n●\tLB-FT\n●\tNM\nEither at the wheels or at the crank\n\nCompare multiple measurements!\n\nYou can save each one of your Dyno measurements, and compare them, or just analyze them interactively.\n\nWhat datalog files can be used?\n\n●\tJB4\n●\tMHD\n●\tProTool\n●\tCOBB\n●\tMegaSquirt\n●\tProTool\n●      Bootmod3\n●\tand any other CSV file\n\nThis is the easiest way to have your torque and horsepower measured with a virtual dyno using only your mobile phone and your datalog. You can see if your mods or tune work right away, and compare them.\n\nLog Dyno has been compared to multiple real life dyno sheets, and measurements were spot on, with multiple different vehicles\n\nHow does it work?\n\n#1. Datalog your vehicle\nTake the log just like a dyno pull, in one given gear, from low rpm to high rpm. Try to avoid wheelspin as it can cause spikes in the graph.\n\n#2. Set up your vehicle data\n\nThe dyno app requires some data about your vehicle. You’ll be asked to set values for the following:\n\n●\tCar Name\n●\tWeight\n●\tTank Capacity\n●\tTire Size\n●\tDT%\n●\tDrag Coefficient\n●\tFrontal Area\n\n#3. Share the results!\n\nYou can share your results right from the virtual dyno measurement page to basically any app or post it to any social network or email it. Of course, you can just save the results in your phone gallery too.\n\nHow accurate is the dyno measurement?\n\nIf you have set your vehicle data correctly, the results our dyno app gives will be the same as the results a real dyno will give you. Also, keep in mind that wheelspin may result in spikes in the graph. If you are unable to avoid it, you’ll still get accurate results, you just need to ignore the spikes.\n\nThe best thing about our dyno app is that you can see right away how your mods work after datalogging.\nNow, you don't have to go to the dyno if you want to measure any small modification or just never had your car's power measured. You can see right away how your mods or tune work after datalogging. You can dyno unlimited times and unlimited vehicles for the fraction of the price of a dyno measurement.\n\nYou have to set your car up, how much it weighs, its tire size, the gear ratios, and also what your car drag coefficient and frontal area are, which the app will help in determining.\n\nAfter specifying for which gear you had the datalog taken and specifying the driver, passenger, and possible cargo weight, you can open the CSV or MSL file.\n\nBased on your car data and environmental values, the app generates a torque and horsepower curve, which you can analyze. The app also points out the peak values, and you will be able to see at what rpm you made the most torque and the most power.\n\nIf you have any questions feel free to send an email: profisoftgames@gmail.com"

This app allows the user to select the type of clay target they are shooting, select the distance of the target, and the angle to get recommendations for the correct choke to use, and the estimated lead for the target.  Using this app will help the user become a more successful shooter.\n\nIn addition to the choke and lead recommendations this app has a Shotgun Vault which allows the users to catalog their firearms and the chokes they already have for them.  There is also a feature within the vault where the user can store notes about each firearm such as bore sizes, serial numbers, and any other notes the user wishes to save.  All of this information is securely stored within the cloud, only accessible to you.  This can be a very helpful feature to save notes about the user’s favorite firearms.\n\nAfter entering firearm information into the Shotgun Vault, the user will see an add to cart icon appear on the main Choke Selection screen when they do not own a specifically recommended choke.  From this add to cart icon, the user can painlessly order chokes to fill in their set through the Briley Best Shot App.  \n\nAs an added bonus, any chokes purchased through the Briley Best Shot App will qualify for a 10% discount!"

      "label": "Chronocurl is a laser stopwatch system useful to calculate relevant information for curling players.\n\nThe curling delivery is a complex process. In order to progress, it is very important to get accurate feedback in order to quantify the diverse parameter composing the delivery. Three main parameter define the trajectory of a curling stone: the direction, the rotation speed and the linear speed of the rock.\n\nChronocurl quantifies the linear speed of the curling rock when it cuts the laser beam. Using the value of speed, the player can easily work on his consistency without having to refer visually to the distance travelled by the rock. The app lets you read speed data in numerous units such as km/h, mph, m/s. The app also allow conversion of speed data at the hog line into approximation of commonly used split times such as back-line to hog-line or T-line to hog line.\n\nPro Version\nThe Pro version of the app allows the combination of multiple Chronocurl within a single pratice. This way, Chronocurl will give you the speed of the rock but can also measure split times with great precision.\n\nThe combination of multiple Chronocurl (up to 6 units on 2 sheets) multiplies the number of possibilities.\n\nThe Pro version of the app also allows audio feedback. This way a player can receive his data without even looking at the screen.\n\nSome features :\nAll Speed Units\t\t\t: Free and Pro Version \nDual display\t\t\t\t: Free and Pro Version\nDetail display\t\t\t\t: Free and Pro Version\nRock Circumference Setting: Free and Pro Version\nBetween shot timer\t\t: Free and Pro Version\nHog to hog split times\t\t: Pro Version\nAudio feedback\t\t\t: Pro Version\nSide by side practice\t\t: Pro Version\nMulti-Chronocurl\t\t\t: Pro Version\nEmail of practice data\t\t: Pro Version\nMultiple Rock circumference: Pro Version"

Do you get bored in the arena and need to help finding new ways to keep both you and your horse entertained?\n\nIf the answer is yes to any of the above then you need the Polework Patterns App by Fancy Footwork Equestrian  in your life! \n\nThis app includes 40 different layouts (20 main and 20 random) which are designed to be multi directional and use between one and twenty poles. There are several unique features including:\n\n- the option to search for layouts based on the amount of poles you want to use:\n   • 1–5 poles\n   • 6–10 poles \n   • 11–15 poles \n   • 16–20 poles \n\n- the option to search for exercises based on what area of a horse’s development you want to focus on – here you will find 15 categories including \n   • Balance \n   • Core \n   • Engagement \n   • Response to rider \n   • ... and more!\n\n- a random button which can be used if you can’t decide which layout to go for, or if you like to live a little dangerously! Either way press that random button, watch the poles spin, the confetti fall and then marvel as your layout is revealed! \n\n- all of the layouts have different suggested exercises to use (four options for the main layouts and two options for the random layouts), each of which are colour-coded to show which pace to use, and a proposed difficulty rating attached to help you decide if that exercise is suitable to your horse’s stage of training.\n\n- 120 potential exercises with four suggestions given per exercise as to what areas it could help your horse improve on. (Flexibility, straightness etc) \n\n- a “Favourites” folder where you can add any of the 80 exercises used in the main layouts for quick and easy access.\n\nPolework patterns was developed by the creator of Fancy Footwork Equestrian, Nina Gill. Nina is a qualified coach who runs Polework clinics full-time and is passionate about her work and the many benefits of polework. This passion has led to Fancy Footwork Equestrian collaborating with some of the U.K.’s biggest equestrian YouTubers and influencers, as well as having Polework training articles printed in three of the biggest equine magazines to date. \nWith this app you will never run out of Polework ideas, even the biggest layouts have been designed to be broken down into smaller sections so that those sections can be used as a standalone layout if you don’t have enough poles to build the whole thing."

Internal barometer is used on supported devices for better precision (from iPhone 6/6+ and newer iPads). If more accuracy is needed, a portable weather station can also be used. Application can run without GPS, WiFi and internet. If you're in internet range, you don't need to supply any data. If you're out of internet range, all you need to supply is the outside air temperature.\n\nGreat tool for pilots, drag racers, engine tuners, or anyone who needs to conveniently find their Air Density, Density Altitude, Dyno Correction Factor and rest of calculated data.\n\nNo ads or in-app purchases.\n\nThe application is made up of three tabs that are described next:\n\n• Results: In this tab are shown:\n- Air Density\n- Density Altitude\n- Relative Air Density (RAD)\n- Dew Point\n- SAE - Dyno Correction Factor\n- SAE - Relative Horsepower\n- Station Pressure\n- Saturation Vapor Pressure\n- Virtual Temperature\n- Actual Vapor Pressure\n- Cumulus Cloud Base Height\n- Dry Air\n- Dry Air Pressure\n- Volumetric Content of Oxygen\n- Oxygen Pressure\n\n In addition, the parameters used for the calculations are showed and can be changed (time, temperature, humidity, pressure and altitude).\n For each of the parameters there is a detailed explanation (just tap on any parameter).\n\n• History: This tab contains the history of all calculating data. If you change the weather, the new data will be saved in history.\n\n• Weather: In this tab, you can set the values for current temperature, pressure, altitude and humidity. \n  Also this tab allows to use the GPS to get the current position and altitude, and connect to an external service (you can choose one weather data source from several possible) to get the weather conditions of the nearest weather station (temperature, pressure and humidity).\n  You can manually select which type of atmospheric pressure you are working with (for example if you use portable barometers, weather stations):\n- sea level pressure QNH\n- sea level pressure QFF\n- station pressure (barometric pressure)\n  In addition, this application can work with a pressure sensor built into the iPhone. You can see if it is available on your device and turn it on or off.\n  Also, on this tab, you can enable alerts about possible carburetor icing.\n\nThe app let you use different measure units: ºC y ºF for temperatures, meter and feet for altitude, and mb, hPa, mmHg, inHg y atm for pressures.\n\n\nIf you have any doubt about using this App, please, contact us. We answer every question, and we take care of all comments from our users to try to improve our software. We are also users of this application."

We are leaving the choice to you.\n* Of course, in the future there will be some other fake applications, but do not forget us, we are the first to do this and we will always be best for you.\n \n What is the reason to choose us for you?\n* We are cheaper than others.

For this reason, even if it reduce our success percentage, we wanted to serve you almost every league. You will decide which league or which team you want to bet on.\n\n For “1” and “2” predictions, we suggest you to use only first leagues. For second and third leagues, it is more common to see that strong teams loose the match or the match ends in draw. We do not restrict those kind of situations in our application because we want to serve you every single match.\n\n For “Over” and “Under” predictions, we suggest you to prepare one table to determine which league is suitable for “Over” or “Under” betting. For example: Greece first league, Greece second league, Portugal second league, Spain second league are not suitable for “Over” predictions. Do not bet on.\n\n We tried to explain how you are going to use this application, we hope that we succeeded. If you are good at logic and mathematics, than you will use this application more effective and successful. You will use this application more effective day by day. You will even create black list for teams and leagues by time pasing.\n\n Good luck !"

Internal barometer is used on supported devices for better precision. If more accuracy is needed, a portable weather station can also be used. Application can run without GPS, WiFi and internet, in this case user has to give the weather data manually.\n\n• For each carburetor setup, the following values are given: main jet, needle type, needle position, pilot jet, air screw position, throttle valve size, spark plug\n• Fine tuning for all these values\n• History of all your jetting setups\n• Graphic display of fuel mix quality (Air/Flow Ratio or Lambda)\n• Selectable fuel type (gasoline with or without ethanol, Racing fuels available, for example: VP C12, VP 110, VP MRX02)\n• Adjustable fuel/oil ratio\n• Mix wizard to get the perfect mix ratio (fuel calculator)\n• Carburetor ice warning\n• Possibility of use automatic weather data or a portable weather station\n• If you don't want to share your location, you can manually select any place in the world, the carburetor setups will be adapted for this place\n• let you use different measure units: ºC y ºF for temperatures, meter and feet for altitude, liters, ml, gallons, oz for fuel, and mb, hPa, mmHg, inHg atm for pressures\n\nValid for the following models from 1990 to 2022:\n• YZ65\n• YZ80\n• YZ85\n• YZ112\n• YZ125\n• YZ125X\n• YZ134\n• YZ144\n• YZ250\n• YZ250X\n• WR500\n• PW50\n• PW80\n\n\nThe application contains four tabs, which are described next:\n\n• Results: In this tab main jet, needle type, needle position, pilot jet, air screw position, throttle valve size, spark plug are shown. These data are calculated depending on the weather conditions and the engine configuration given in the next tabs.\n  This tab lets do a fine tuning adjustment for all this values to adapt to the concrete engine.\n  Besides this jetting information, the air density, density altitude, relative air density, SAE - dyno correction factor, station pressure, SAE- relative horsepower, volumetric content of oxygen, oxygen pressure are shown too.\n On this tab, you can also share your settings with your colleagues, or add  settings to your favorites.\n  You can also see in a graphic form the calculated ratio of air and fuel (lambda).\n\n• History: This tab contains the history of all carburetor setups. If you change the weather, or engine setup, or fine tuning, the new setup will be saved in history.\n  This tab also contains your favorite settings.\n\n• Engine: You can configure in this screen the information about the engine, that is, engine model, year, spark manufacturer, fuel type, oil mix ratio.\n\n• Weather: In this tab, you can set the values for current temperature, pressure, altitude and humidity. \n  Also this tab allows to use the GPS to get the current position and altitude, and connect to an external service (you can choose one weather data source from several possible) to get the weather conditions of the nearest weather station (temperature, pressure and humidity).\n  In addition, this application can work with a pressure sensor built into the iPhone. You can see if it is available on your device and turn it on or off.\n  Also, on this tab, you can manually select any place in the world, the carburetor setups will be adapted for this place.\n  Moreover, on this tab, you can enable alerts about possible carburetor icing.\n\n\nIf you have any doubt about using this App, please, contact us.

      "label": "THE BEST VIDEO REPLAY APP!\n- Number 1 in the Sports iPad Category!!!\n- Trusted by the US major league baseball and basketball teams.\n\nAre you frustrated by making the same mistakes and wasting time on your practice? Video Delay Instant Replay is a fantastic way for athletes to receive instant feedback on their performance. Analyze your form, build good muscle memory, and get faster results. \n\nMake every practice satisfying and effective!\n\nThere are three main features: the DELAY, the SLO-MO, and the REPLAY.\n\nThe DELAY Mode continuously shows the delayed video during practice. After setting the buffer time, there's no need to record and replay manually. The video feedback will be on until you reset the buffer or hit the exit button.\n\nThe SLO-MO Mode captures a short video and instantly replays it in slow motion. It works best for quick activities, like punch or shoot. To adjust the speed rate, use the slider. The recording will get you short slow-motion videos of every repetition. \n\nThe REPLAY View* allows frame-by-frame analysis of athlete moves, including measuring the angles. You can also export a short part of the replay video using AB selection.\n* It works only with Delay mode and a buffer time longer than 1 second.\n\nImprove your skills and get faster results:\n1. Set the Buffer time.\n2. Do your action.\n3. Watch the video feedback.\n4. Immediately correct your posture and repeat!\n\nCoaches and teachers! \nUse the app with an external screen for even better feedback during practice! Watch the Replay video with your team, analyze your players' performance, and correct errors. Add lines on the screen to check out the angles. Trim the video, so it only shows what you want your students to concentrate on. Record only necessary parts of the practice. Instant Feedback also helps to settle disputes between players.\n\nBasketball, baseball, and football players! \nPractice by repetition -  improve your shooting form by copying your favorite players' moves. Make out the best of your hitting drill. Take a quick look at the footage, correct your posture, and return to the action. No need to rewind or touch the device; the video will play instantly. You will be able to see if your pose is good and if your fake moves are effective. \n\nGolf and tennis players! \nUse a motion-detection grid and correct your swing or backhand instantly! Perform proper movements and maintain good posture while exercising. Build better muscle memory and improve your game!\n\nTraining martial arts, archery, or shooting? \nStudy your form with delayed video feedback. Set a short delay time and analyze your moves in slow motion. See what to correct in your kicks or punches.\n\nPilates or yoga fan? \nCheck out poses you won’t see in the mirror, like dog or pigeon. Make sure you are true to form and protect yourself from injury.\n\nActors and performers!\nReplay yourself performing and improve your acting skills. Check out your gestures in slow-motion and make them the best!\n\nFor information on how to use the VDIR, please check out the User Guide in the app!"

      "label": "Listen to your racquet and perfect your game!\n\nRacquetTune ensures that your racquet is ideally suited to your style of play. Simple and straightforward to use, the app uses the sound generated by tapping the strings to calculate the tension with high accuracy. In addition, the interactive swingweight calculator aids in customizing your racquet to fit your own stroke pattern, while the stiffness calculator allows you to simulate different racquet configurations. \n\nRacquetTune not only makes it easier to decide when it is time to restring, it is also an invaluable tool when testing different racquets and strings and in identifying which of your racquets is best suited for different types of games. RacquetTune also allows you to check whether your stringer is consistent in his work. \nRacquetTune includes the following user-friendly tools:\n\nTension measurement \n- Quickly determines the tension and stringbed stiffness. \n- Able to detect changes in tension as small as 0.1 kg/0.2 lb.\n- An accuracy indicator ensures results are consistent. \n- Graphical presentation of sound waves helps you find the ideal way of tapping the strings. \n- Settings can be customized to serve tennis, squash, racquetball and badminton racquets, respectively. \n- View the tension history for each racquet as a list or a graph.\n- Email a spreadsheet with test data.\n\nSwingweight calculator \n- Add as many weights as you wish to the frame. \n- Move and change weights to visualize how swingweight, balance and sweet spot location are affected.\n- Enter target values for the racquet and let RacquetTune distribute the weights automatically.\n\nStiffness calculator \n- Simulate various racquet and string configurations\n- Vary tension, string type and racquet head size. \n- Shows load-displacement curves, stiffness and elastic energies \n- Handles the large deformations encountered in actual play \n\nView a demo video at racquettune.com\n\nRacquetTune has been featured in tennis magazines in USA, Italy, France, Germany, Sweden and Norway. \n\n\"The app is very, very impressive. I get more tension diagnostic questions than just about anybody in the universe, so this is a very good thing to be able to recommend.\" \nJonathan Wolfe \nUS Racquet Stringers Association\n\nNote, that the actual string tension in the racquet and the setting seen on a stringing machine are two different things and therefore incomparable - more information can be found at racquettune.com."

      "label": "The Bicycle Maintenance Guide differs to other repair apps on the AppStore because it is one of the only apps to be packed with quality video content. Most other apps just content text and images.\n\nThe Bicycle Maintenance Guide app is unique and differs to other content found online, such as YouTube and Parktool, because the majority of the apps content can be found and accessed with no internet connection. This means you can use the app to help repair your bike even when you're out in the sticks with no internet connection, to get you home or to your local bike shop. \n\nThe app is the most expansive bicycle repair guide in the App Store with over 100 sections, 60 professionally filmed videos containing over 7.5 hours of footage, 180+ high resolution images and over 50,000 words. \n\nThe Bicycle Maintenance Guide app is a complete guide to bicycle repairs, shown and instructed by two world class bike mechanics - Mike Rawson and Chuck Buckley.\nMike is a Senior Service Technician at a top end bicycle company and was a Team GB Mechanic for 7 years, where he covered the Olympic Games, World Championships and European Cycling Tours.\nChuck was a Head Mechanic of a UK professional cycling team for a long period before returning to NZ where he now owns and runs a bike shop.\n\nThe app is broken up into 5 areas, these are:-\n\nREPAIRS\n• Exclusive access to our private YouTube channel featuring 60 professionally shot HD video tutorials. These videos are not available on-line without this app.\n• Each video tutorial is backed up with a list of tools required and fully presented step by step instructions with hi-resolution photographs.\n• Comprehensive written tutorials backed up with high quality imagery to illustrate how to perform your own repairs\n\nAT THE ROADSIDE\n• An additional 8 video tutorials which can be viewed in an emergency whilst out riding.\n• A unique feature with ‘get out of jail’ tricks that will get the rider home after a major breakdown at the roadside. One video shows how to use a £5 note to repair a torn tyre.\n• Each of these videos also backed up with a list of tools required and fully presented step by step instructions with hi-resolution photographs.\n\nCOMPONENTS\n• Annotated and clearly labelled hi-resolution photographs of each component on a bicycle. By fully explaining what each part does, the user will have a fuller understanding of the components, giving them the confidence to adjust and maintain that part.\n\nFAULT DIAGNOSTICS\n• Easy to follow steps to help diagnose and remedy those common problems with your bicycle.\n\nSERVICING\n• Exclusive servicing guide written by Chuck Buckley encompassing weekly, monthly and annual servicing of your bicycle.\n\nOTHER FEATURES\n• Links to our social media pages and website.\n• Link to email us with any questions or offer your feedback.

Tap the screen once again after your break and the app will display your Break Speed speed.\n\nBreak Speed is more than 10x the accuracy of a radar gun and has become the standard for break shot speed measurements, privately and professionally. With such high precision, you can use Break Speed to provide that feedback you need to improve your breaks. Break harder and more consistently with Break Speed.\n\nDon't worry about others breaking around you or other pool hall noise. Even shouting players won't fool our Break Recognition technology.\n\nFind out why professional pool players are using and recommending Break Speed to others.\n\nOur collaboration with Predator has been very effective. It's been great to work with a team that understands the science of billiards. The Predator R&D team has been testing the application along side their own speed measurement equipment and the Iron Willie robot,  following a number of testing sessions, the Predator R&D team found the application so accurate that a partnership in pool science began.\n\n\"The application is really spot on. During my many testing sessions with the Predator Team there was very little deviation between the Predator testing equipment and the application,\" said Predator Pro Mike Dechaine.\n\nIf you're a serious player, and you don't have Break Speed Powered By Predator, what are you waiting for?"

The same old stickhandling drills get boring and you can't afford a private stickhandling instructor. Well.... you can now!\n\nDangleTime is your private stickhandling coach on your phone. Anytime you want to work on your stickhandling just pull out your phone and get training. \n\nThe app keeps track of your \"DangleTime\" which is the amount of time you spend practicing using the app. This time can be shared and compared with friends. Who can get the highest DangleTime? The higher your DangleTime the more you can level up, go from a Duster to an All-Star!\n\nThe app comes with 3 free training packs. Each training pack contains 8 stickhandling drills. When you select a training pack a drill will play for 20 seconds with a 10 second break and then the next drill will play until all drills in that pack have played. These times can be adjusted in the settings menu. \n\nIf you'd like more stickhandling drills you can purchase them and continue to challenge yourself and improve your stickhandling. \nAll drills are demonstrated by Jeremy Rupke from How To Hockey with plans to add new drill packs from more hockey instructors. \n\nShow me your DangleTime with #DangleTime on Instagram and Twitter and follow me @howtohockey"

      "label": "Used by beginners through Major Championship winners on the PGA Tour, and validated by an Independent Scientific Study by the Departments of Physics and Biomechanics at Yale University.\n\nThe Tour Tempo Total Game allows you to learn how to correctly integrate the Tempo of the Tour Pros into your golf swing. Over 100,000 golfers worldwide, including Major Championship winners on the PGA Tour, have improved their games by using Tour Tempo.  \n\n\"In all the reviews I've written for MyGolfSpy (a number now pushing up on 100), I'd only given one perfect score. Now Tour Tempo can be added to that most-elite company. Tour Tempo is scientifically proven, it's easy to use, and it will help you in every facet of the game.\" \n— GolfSpy Matt: http://www.mygolfspy.com/tour-tempo-review\n\n\"It will be the best thing that you will ever do for your game.\" \n— Pat Dempsey, 2011 RE/MAX World Long Drive Grand Champion 55+\n\n\"You will get better right away! When you synch your swing to that of the Tour Pros with Tour Tempo, you’ll get better right now!\" \n— Dan Rooney, Folds of Honor\n\n\"The Unified Theory of Tempo\" \n— Golf Digest \n\n\"No one has ever come up with a way to teach Tempo until now.\"\n— Travel + Leisure Golf \n\nBased on the international best selling golf book, Tour Tempo. The book outlines and explains the discovery of a specific mathematical ratio regarding the elapsed time of the backswing and the elapsed time of the downswing of the Tour Pros. The Tour Tempo System is simple and easy to learn. All you do is react to three scientifically spaced musical notes. These musical notes alert you to start your takeaway, start your downswing, and then the third note lines you up with impact. It’s just that easy - you literally download the app, turn it on, grab a club and start swinging to the Tempo of the Tour Pros.\n\nLONG GAME\nThe Long Game Tones will teach you how to swing with the tempo ratio exhibited by the Tour Pros. We measured the time of their backswings and downswings by counting how many frames of video each part took. The magic ratio on full swings turned out to be three parts backswing to one part downswing. Tones are provided for each of the following frame ratios of Tour Tempo - 18/6, 21/7, 24/8 & 27/9. The Tour Tempo Tones have a clear purpose. They establish the intrinsic tempo of the golf swing in your subconscious mind. Once this is accomplished, you will not have to think about tempo while playing. This is what the Tour Pros have already done. You are about to acquire that same ability.\n\nSHORT GAME\nThe Total Game App also contains the Short Game Tones of 14/7, 16/8, 18/9 & 20/10. After the publication of Tour Tempo, John Novosel studied the short game swings of the top touring pros, and discovered that virtually all of them employ a 2 to 1 swing ratio on or around the greens - a different Tempo than the 3 to 1 ratio of the Long Game. This is another reason why the game of golf is so hard to master.      \n\nTEMPO TRACKS\nThe Tempo Tracks are an easy way to integrate Tour Tempo into your daily routine. One of the best ways to use the Tracks is to listen to them while driving to the course before a round of golf. The more you listen to them, the more the Tour Tempo rhythm will be ingrained into your Golf Swing. \n\nFOCUS TRACKS\nThe Focus Tracks are revolutionary relaxation songs that contain the Tones of Tour Tempo. Each Track has a Part II that has binaural tones embedded in the music to get your brain into an optimum state for concentration. This optimum state is more commonly known to athletes as “Being in the Zone.”\n\nVIDEOS\nThe videos give a complete explanation of the Tones and how to use them to immediately and dramatically improve your Total Game.  \n\nDISCOUNT\nThe app is your first step towards a more powerful, consistent golf game, and that is why we are giving you a discount from our Tour Tempo Shop. On the 'Info' screen you will find a one-time discount code good for $10 off on a future purchase at TourTempo.com and TourTempo.eu."

      "label": "Avy savvy backcountry skiers and riders know that three things count when it comes to the terrain’s influence on avalanches: the slope, the elevation, and the (compass) aspect. And the Avalanche Inclinometer delivers all three. Sure, you can find plenty of inclinometer apps (also known as clinometers) that are designed for carpenters, but Steve's Avalanche Inclinometer is meant for people who spend time in avalanche terrain. \n\nThis app shows the slope, elevation, and aspect in BIG FONTS which are perfect for tired eyes in stormy (or bright-and-too-sunny) weather. And it doesn’t display a gaggle of tiny buttons and widgets to decipher when you should be skiing.\n\nYou can sight across a slope by holding your phone parallel to the slope, or you can sight up or down a slope by sighting along the long-edge of your phone like a gunsight. (Through-the-camera sighting is nifty when the light is just right, but it often isn't.)\n\nWhen you have your phone aligned with the slope, a single tap on the screen will lock the data so you can read it. The Avalanche Inclinometer will even speak to you as you’re measuring the steepness so you won’t need to look at the screen. And the BIG inclinometer dial changes colors based on the slope which provides instant feedback on how the steepness of the terrain is contributing to the likelihood of an avalanche.\n\nAfter measuring the slope, you can tap a single button to share your current GPS location, the slope in degrees, and the elevation. The email includes kml and gpx waypoint files, and a link that will let you quickly see the location in any browser. You can enter the email address one time and the Avalanche Inclinometer will remember it for next time. Less typing; more skiing.\n\nThe Avalanche Inclinometer isn’t free, but apps don’t grow on trees. To buy this app you’ll spend less than buying a beer at a ski resort—think of it as buying Steve a beer!\n\nIn addition to the Avalanche Inclinometer, it is important that you take an avy class, pay attention to the avalanche red flags, use good route finding techniques, and practice your avalanche rescue skills frequently"

No basketball to play with, but your motions are on point!\n\nThe good old days flew by faster than you can shout 'travel!'.\nThat's youth for you. It came, now it's went.\nOr so you thought...\nYet now, that imaginary basketball's back in virtual form. He shoots!

We get you, man!\nWe made AirShot: a game just for you!\n\nThere's the effortless motion recognition.

Most other apps just content text and images.\n\nThe Bicycle Maintenance Guide app is unique and differs to other content found online, such as YouTube and Parktool, because the majority of the apps content can be found and accessed with no internet connection. This means you can use the app to help repair your bike even when you're out in the sticks with no internet connection, to get you home or to your local bike shop. \n\nThe app is the most expansive bicycle repair guide in the App Store with over 100 sections, 60 professionally filmed videos containing over 7.5 hours of footage, 180+ high resolution images and over 50,000 words. \n\nThe Bicycle Maintenance Guide app is a complete guide to bicycle repairs, shown and instructed by two world class bike mechanics - Mike Rawson and Chuck Buckley.\nMike is a Senior Service Technician at a top end bicycle company and was a Team GB Mechanic for 7 years, where he covered the Olympic Games, World Championships and European Cycling Tours.\nChuck was a Head Mechanic of a UK professional cycling team for a long period before returning to NZ where he now owns and runs a bike shop.\n\nThe app is broken up into 5 areas, these are:-\n\nREPAIRS\n• Exclusive access to our private YouTube channel featuring 60 professionally shot HD video tutorials. These videos are not available on-line without this app.\n• Each video tutorial is backed up with a list of tools required and fully presented step by step instructions with hi-resolution photographs.\n• Comprehensive written tutorials backed up with high quality imagery to illustrate how to perform your own repairs\n\nAT THE ROADSIDE\n• An additional 8 video tutorials which can be viewed in an emergency whilst out riding.\n• A unique feature with ‘get out of jail’ tricks that will get the rider home after a major breakdown at the roadside. One video shows how to use a £5 note to repair a torn tyre.\n• Each of these videos also backed up with a list of tools required and fully presented step by step instructions with hi-resolution photographs.\n\nCOMPONENTS\n• Annotated and clearly labelled hi-resolution photographs of each component on a bicycle. By fully explaining what each part does, the user will have a fuller understanding of the components, giving them the confidence to adjust and maintain that part.\n\nFAULT DIAGNOSTICS\n• Easy to follow steps to help diagnose and remedy those common problems with your bicycle.\n\nSERVICING\n• Exclusive servicing guide written by Chuck Buckley encompassing weekly, monthly and annual servicing of your bicycle.\n\nOTHER FEATURES\n• Links to our social media pages and website.\n• Link to email us with any questions or offer your feedback.

      "label": "Flyskyhy forms your flight instrument during flight and shows all information you need for that. You get the normal data like altitude, climb rate, ground speed, and glide angle. But it also calculates and shows the current wind direction and strength, very important for your safety.\n\nA moving and rotating map shows your current flying position and flight trail. It indicates where you have gone up (in a thermal), and where you have had faster than normal decline. With that, you can easily find back that thermal that you lost. The map also shows the nearest known landing spots, and whether they are reachable by normal glide, given your current altitude and wind direction.\n\nIntegration with Bluetooth varios SensBox, FlyNet, GoFly iPico, XC-Tracer, BlueFlyVario, or SkyDrop gives accurate altitude and lift information. That turns your iPhone into an full-fletched GPS-vario, including vario tones.\n\nThe app makes a full log of your flight, that can be analyzed afterwards. Besides normal data like start and landing positions, duration of flight, and an altitude graph of the flight, Flyskyhy also calculates the scoring distances for you. So you can immediately see whether you have broken that FAI triangle record.\n\nYour live location is reported on livetrack24.com or loctome.com if you desire, so anybody can follow your flight while it is happening. If you are flying together with friends, then their location is shown on your map during your flight. So you never have to wonder anymore whether they are in front of or behind you.\n\nThe flight display has multiple screens which are all fully configurable. You can move all elements to other spots, delete and add elements, and resize them.\n\nThrough in-app purchases, the app also supports airspaces and waypoints.\n\nThe app is optimised for paragliding and hang gliders, but can be used with all  kinds of airsports.\n\nMain features during the flight;\n• Altitude, climb rate, ground speed, air speed, direction, glide angle and many more\n• Wind strength and direction\n• Moving map of the flying area\n• Spots where you have had lift, great for thermal coring\n• Shows whether you can still reach a landing spot with the current altitude and wind\n• Live tracking of your flight on livetrack24.com or loctome.com\n• Shows live location of your friends during flight\n\nAfter the flight:\n• Full logbook of all your flights\n• Basic flight data like start/landing, duration, height difference, distance flown, and many more\n• Calculation of 5-points, open triangle, and FAI triangle distances\n• Graph of altitude and climb rate\n• Signed IGC and KML log files of flights\n• Transfer the log to iTunes or send by email\n• Upload the flight directly to XContest, ParaglidingForum, DHV-XC, and other Leonardo servers\n• Open flight in Google Earth on the iPhone\n• Replay the flight and relive it!\n\nBy purchasing the Waypoints Extension you get access to:\n• A fully zoomable and scrollable map with the waypoints and optimised route. The map also shows start and landing spots, as well as restricted airspaces (with the Airspace Extension)\n• Enter new waypoints, either on the map or by specifying the parameters\n• Full route support with start time, goal, entry/exit points, etc. \n• Many instruments to guide you along the route\n• Visible and audible indication when a waypoint has been reached\n• Complete waypoints organiser\n• Import and export of various waypoint file formats\n\nBy purchasing the Airspace Extension you get access to:\n• Airspaces of 30 countries\n• Display of airspaces on the map with configurable colors and formats\n• Display of your vertical position w.r.t. airspaces\n• Visible and audible warnings when approaching and entering an airspace\n• Shows local airspaces by touching a spot on the map\n\nNote: a live internet connection is required for live tracking of your and your friends locations\nNote: continuous GPS and screen usage makes the battery drain faster than normal"

Validation published on the Journal of Strength & Conditioning Research and Journal of Sports Sciences*****\n***Featured by Apple under ‘Best New Apps’ in 100+ countries***\n***The only app which calculates the force-velocity profile using the groundbreaking Samozino’s method***\n \nMy Jump 2 is the first app scientifically developed to measure your jump height. With a great design and validated by sport scientists, My Jump 2 is as reliable as a 10000$ force platform. Scientifically probed!\n\n------------------------------\n \nPierre Samozino (PhD, sport scientist, University of Savoy): “My Jump 2 makes possible the determination of the jump height with a high accuracy, which has been validated in very recent scientific study. The other, and I think the main added value of this app is to propose the determination of the Force-Velocity-Power profile of each athlete and its own imbalance between force and velocity qualities. Very useful to optimize your strength training and improve your explosive performances.”\n\nJean-Benoit Morin (PhD, sport scientist, University of Nice): “My Jump 2 is the cutting edge, scientifically validated and most practical application to measure athletes vertical jumping performance, and the only one to include the complete \"Optimal Force-Velocity Profile\" analysis we recently validated. I'm using it with athletes, students, and research subjects. The entire Jumping Force-Velocity-Power and Optimal F-V Profile approach in your pocket!”\n \n------------------------------\n \nMy Jump 2 gives you advanced information of your jumps using the camera on your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad. Just record a jump, select accurately its take off and landing and lets My Jump do its magic. My Jump 2 calculates the height, flight time, velocity, force and power of your vertical jumps. Also, it gives you the contact time, vertical stiffness and reactive strength index (RSI) of your Drop Jumps. Moreover, it allows you to calculate your Force-Velocity profile using Samozino's method. Complete analysis of your jumps right on your hand!\n \nFEATURES:\n \n• Accurate measurement of your vertical jumps. Scientifically demonstrated!\n• Calculate the force-velocity profile using the groundbreaking Samozino’s method. You can know your maximal theoretical force, velocity, power and how far you are from your optimal capabilities! You can even get information about which quality (force or velocity) you should work to increase your explosive performance.\n• Record stunnig slowmo videos up to 240fps or import as much as you like from your camera roll.\n• Different jump types: countermovement jump (CMJ), squat jump (SJ), drop jump (DJ), CMJ free arms, horizontal jumps and repeated jump test!\n• Annotate the external load used (CMJ & SJ) or the height of the box (DJ) to organize your best performances in different categories.\n• Multi-user. My Jump 2 allows you to create as many users as you want. Monitor all your team on your iDevice!\n• iCloud sync (iOS 13+)\n• History. Record as many jumps as you want for each user created. With My Jump 2 you can analyze the evolution of your performance during time. You can even observe exactly how much you have improved!\n• Export your data to Excel, Numbers, Google Drive and more!\n• Beautiful, intuitive like design.\n• Universal app: purchase once and install it on your iPhone, iPad and Mac (10.15+)\n \nNote: My Jump 2 works better with slow-motion videos.\n \nMY JUMP 2, A JUMP PLATFORM RIGHT ON YOUR HAND!"

By freedivers, for freedivers, our freedive apnea trainer helps you with static apnea tables and lung capacity training so you can effectively increase the time when diving underwater.\r\nSee why STAmina Apnea Trainer is one of the best apnea apps to improve the breath-holding time for freediving, scuba diving and spearfishing, as well as surfing, running, and other water sports with 6 different apnea tables types.\n\n\r\n■ FREEDIVING & SPEARFISHING APNEA TRAINER FEATURES:\n\n\r\n◉ 6 APNEA TABLE OPTIONS \r\nSTAmina Apnea Trainer can create / generate custom apnea (exercises that are automatically created based on the maximum breath-hold and match the user’s level) or let you select from the following customizable table types:\r\n\r\n- O2 deprivation table – accustoms a body to lower oxygen levels. This is achieved by increasing the amount of time that you hold your breath on each attempt, while the resting time is fixed.\r\n\r\n- CO2 Tolerance table – helps a body to adapt to high carbon dioxide levels. This is achieved by decreasing the length of resting time between fixed breath-hold periods.\r\n\r\n- Wonka table – a variation of CO2 tables. Apnea timer starts after the first contraction, the rest time takes one breath.\r\n\r\n- Mix table – tables where apnea time increases and rest time decreases with each round.\r\n\r\n- Custom table – allows mixing of different approaches to create a custom training, thus generating the most effective training program.\r\n\r\n- Pranayama – a breathing technique to decrease stress in the body and relax the nervous system.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ APPLE HEALTH SYNCRONIZATION \n\n\r\n\r\n◉ PERSONALIZED TRAINING WITH VARYING DIFFICULTY\r\nWhen you start working with the application, you set your personal record in breath holding. Based on this data, the app will offer a personalized training program with exercises of 3 difficulty levels to choose from: easy, normal, and hard.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ PERSONALIZED EXERCISE SETTINGS \r\nEach exercise can be edited by setting your own number of repetitions, breath hold time, rest time, etc.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ TRAINING REMINDERS \r\nGet the notification to start your apnea training. Set a reminder in the apnea diver app for the day and the time & get a notification to do a breath holding training session.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ PERSONAL STATISTICS AND DETAILED TRAINING HISTORY\r\nAll your workouts and exercises are recorded in the freedive trainer app to track the detailed progress of each training.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ VOICE GUIDANCE\r\nTraining may be accompanied by voice guidance with male/female voices recorded by professional voice actors. STAmina supports English, French, Russian voice guidance.\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n◉ HEART RATE AND OXYGEN SATURATION TRACKING\r\nTrack your heart rate while doing breath holding exercises (a compatible HR monitor or pulse-oximeter is required) \n\n\r\n\r\n◉ CONTRACTIONS TRACKING \r\nUse our freedive trainer to track unlimited contractions, analyse captured data after exercises\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ CLOUD SYNC / BACKUP\r\nAccess your data on multiple devices and easily restore it in case you switch devices/phones.\n\n\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\nStamina Apnea Trainer allows training breath hold effectively for anyone who cares about all kinds of diving including:\r\n> beginner or professional freedivers;\r\nspearfishers;\r\n> scuba divers to learn how to dive longer on one tank;\r\n> surfers in case of unexpected breath hold;\r\n> underwater sports athletes such as underwater rugby, hockey, etc.\r\n> runners who want to train breath holding & high tolerance to CO2 while running\r\n\r\n_______\r\nInfo https://getstamina.app/\r\nContact https://www.facebook.com/staminamobile/\r\nSupport hello@squarecrowdapps.com"

      "label": "The most advanced sports timer in the AppStore! \nFeatured by Apple in the TV-ad \"Strength\". \n\nSprintTimer is a unique sports timer and photo finish app that employs the same techniques as the fully automatic timing equipment (FAT) used at the Olympics. Start the timer and point the camera towards the finish line. The app creates an image where you can scroll to get the time for each competitor with a 0.01 s accuracy*. SprintTimer also includes a motion/human-activated Video Finish for longer races and a Start Sender for wirelessly controlling SprintTimer from another device.\n\nSprintTimer is used by coaches, teachers, and athletes all over the world for practice and competition in, for example, track & field, cycling, skiing, speed skating, car racing, rowing, kayaking, horses or greyhound racing. \n\nSprintTimer has several advantages over a manual stopwatch: \n- One person can time all participants\n- Higher accuracy*\n- Easier to determine the order\n- The image and the results can be saved\n- Can operate \"hands-free\" when started\n- The timer can be started manually, with a sound, or remotely from another device\n\n*See webpage: sprinttimer.app/accuracy\n\n——— Reviews and Comments ———\n\n\"Without a doubt the best App available on the market for sprinters and coaches who want accurate timing to see their development.\"\nspeedendurance.com\n\n\"AMAZING\"\nthepegeek.com\n\n\"Amazing app for physical education teachers or coaches!  I have used it for timing during our track and field, speed quickness & agility, fitness testing, & many more units.  It is very accurate and easy to use and gets the job done quickly!  A must-have!\"\nmertonphysed.weebly.com\n\n \"The app is very professionally set up and you can very easily capture your whole Track event.\"\nwww.melhamada.com\n\n\"Very useful app for measuring and/or verifying close finishes to track and field or road races.\"\nphysedreview.weebly.com\n\nSatisfied users from all over the world:\n- Brilliant.  A fantastic app for use in school athletics lessons\n- Amazing. This application is awesome and the results are really accurate.\n- What a brilliant app! Our £9k photo finish camera broke down and this app was a real lifesaver and worth way more than £1.50! Highly recommended.\n- This app is wonderful. We use it to time all our meets.\n- This is a great app and it is getting better from release to release\n- Nice, nice, nice! Using it for our youth track team. Love it! 5 stars!\n- Exactly what I needed - Fantastic app\n- Thank you so much for developing this amazing app just when we ran out of options.\n- Congratulations on developing a really clever and useful app.\n- Love what you did with the SprintTimer app.\n\n——— In-App Purchases and Subscriptions ———\n\nThe Start Sender and Results Manager features require the purchase of SprintTimer Pro, available as a subscription at $4.99 per year. There is a 2 weeks free trial period.\n\nShould you choose to subscribe to SprintTimer Pro, the purchase will be charged to your Apple ID account. The subscription will be auto-renewed 24 hours prior to the end of the period. You can manage it from the user settings in iTunes after purchasing it, and you will also be able to cancel the auto-renewing subscription from there.\n\nIf you purchase a new SprintTimer Pro subscription during a free trial you will forfeit any free trial remaining from your first subscription.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy: https://sprinttimer.se/privacy\n\n\nIcon runners made by Freepik from Flaticon.com"

Unlike other predator calling apps on the market, this one was designed with you, the hunter in mind. Everything is on one screen. When you're out in cold weather, the last thing you want to be doing is navigating through many screens to get to the sounds and controls. This app solves that problem. \n\nWhen you start this app up, it's ready to go. The sounds on this calling app have brought much success to those who've used it through the years. This is the only predator calling app you'll ever need for bringing in and locating coyotes, foxes, bobcats, mountain lions, lynx, bears and much more.\n\nYou can play multiple sounds together at the same time, and it can also loop individual sounds so they play non-stop. Sounds will keep playing when your device goes into sleep mode, is locked, or when you minimize the app. You can use your own bluetooth or wireless speaker/amplifier by connecting it to the headphone jack for added volume to aid in long-distance calling. This will be especially useful when crow hunting as you want to be able to broadcast your sounds to much further distances to bring them in to you.\n\nIncludes the following 18 sounds:\nCoyotes Howling\nCoyote Siren Locator\nFox Mating Call\nMountain Lion Growls\nSquirrel Distress\nSquirrel Mating Call\nFrenzied Crows\nSandhill Crane\nJavelina\nBaby Rabbit Distress 1\nBaby Rabbit Distress 2\nBaby Rabbit Distress 3\nCottontail Distress\nJackrabbit Distress\nSparrow Distress\nMockingbird Distress\nRobin Distress\nRodent Distress"

All matches are stored on your iPhone and key statistics give you insights on how to improve your game.\n- Keep track of all your matches (with or without an Apple Watch)\n- Singles and doubles match modes\n- Identify teammates and opponents\n- Track your unforced errors\n- Service statistics\n- Player database to keep notes on opponent strengths and weaknesses\n- Follow live matches point by point\n- Integrates with Health app (steps taken, running distance, maximum heart rate, calories burned) to help you gain insight into your Pickleball workouts as well as to monitor how hard your opponents make you work\n\n---\nHow to use the Watch app:\nIt is so simple. Just start the app from your Apple Watch.\n- Select game setup (i.e.: Doubles, Game to 11, Win by 2)\n- Swipe towards you when you win a rally.\n- Swipe away from you when you lose a rally.\n- Swipe right to record an unforced error.\n- Swipe left to undo.\n- Press down on the watch face to end session or restart a game.\n\nTIP! Swipe from the middle of the watch, not the edge.\n\nScores are spoken aloud and gentle vibrations allow you to continue play without looking at your watch.\nPlayer positions and current server are shown on the watch face in case you lose track.\n\nIMPORTANT:\nThe watch is by default set to wake on wrist raise. If Pickleball Score Keeper does not open on Wrist Raise gesture during a match, please do the following from the watch home screen:\n1. Tap Settings > tap General > tap Wake Screen \n2. Make sure that \"Wake Screen on Wrist Raise\" is turned on. \n3. Scroll down to \"Resume to: Previous Activity\" and checkmark.\n\nPlease don’t be shy to use the Feedback button on the Pickleball Score Keeper iPhone app to contact us with ideas and suggestion.  We welcome your feedback."

Golf GPS that is easy to use, has a beautiful design, and there are no subscription, usage or course download fees.\n\nWe have over 30,000 courses available, with new courses being added every day of the year. You can view the entire course list on our website: www.skydroid.net. \n\nAdd new courses (if yours is missing) to our system using our web based Course Mapper tool (see skydroid.net for details and tutorial). \n\nFeel free to contact us with questions (contact@skydroid.net)\n\nNote: See our usage note below for help on searching for courses.\n\nFEATURES:\n• Clean and Clear design\n\n• Distances to the front, center and back of every green on the course\n\n• Distances to course features (water hazards, bunkers, target points)\n\n• Satellite image of every green and course\n\n• Shot Tracking: Track the distance of your drives!\n\n• Find your distance to ANY point on the course.\n\n• GPS Accuracy indicator (tap at anytime to find your exact accuracy)\n\n• Distances in yards or meters\n\n• Auto Hole advance\n\n• Works Internationally!!\n\n• Audio updates to the center of the green.  A great hands-free way to use SkyDroid.\n\n• Book discounted tee times directly through SkyDroid.\n\nNo other fees are involved, and you can download as many courses you want without any other charges. \n\nWith SkyDroid – Golf GPS, our simple-to-use design will have you spending your time on your golf game, not on clicking buttons. \n\nView all our courses at www.skydroid.net/courses.php\n\nView our FAQ at www.skydroid.net/faq.php\n\n\nUSAGE NOTES:\n\n• SEARCHING for Courses: When searching for courses by name, you can just search for \"Aug\" instead of \"Augusta National Golf Course\" (leave out the quote marks).\n\n• SEARCHING for Courses: Radar button will find Mapped courses within 25mi/40km of your current location.\n\n• To save battery power, click your power button to turn off the screen when not in use.\n\n• Set your GPS Keep Alive in the SkyDroid settings to control how long GPS stays active when SkyDroid is in the background. Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\n• GPS accuracy can vary over time (click the GPS signal strength icon at any time to see your accuracy).\n\n• Before playing a course preview its mapping by clicking the link for the course name at www.skydroid.net/courses.php (best done using a large screen). Let us know of any mapping issues, or make changes yourself.\n\n• If we don’t have your course, you can add it as long as there is a satellite image of the course available in Course Mapper.\n\n• Change distance measurement (yards/meters) in the app Settings available on the in-app Menu.\n\n• While playing golf you will only incur data usage while using the Satellite View screen. Course downloads can be done at home over Wi-Fi and are small in size.\n\nEnjoy your round!!"

      "label": "The TRACT Optics Impact Ballistics mobile application takes the guesswork out of long-range shooting and provides data to help the most experienced shooter as well as the beginner or novice. This mobile application is one of the most comprehensive databases of information available today. With virtually every modern ammunition manufacturer’s information listed shooters can match any TRACT rifle scope reticle to their exact cartridge. Simply select your scope, then your ammo/bullet the program will calculate the bullet drop information as it pertains to your reticle automatically. If you cannot find your particular round of ammunition in the program, simply add the Ballistic Coefficient (B.C.) and Muzzle Velocity to the program and you will be good to go. With the ability to import current weather conditions the Impact program will provide up to date Bullet Drop Compensation to help you make accurate shots in the field or at the range. While the mobile application is designed to provide ballistic date without an internet connection, when the user has an internet connection, they are able to access our complete library of videos, articles, and blogs. Simply navigate to the Learn section of the app and you can access the Getting Started section for Rifle Scopes, Binoculars and Spotting Scopes as well as Pro Shooting Tips with videos detailing How To videos showing how to maximize the performance of your optic. You can even shop our complete line of Optics and Accessories right from the App. This app will be continually updated with new ammunition information, new product releases and videos. Selectable options include Meters or Yards, Drag Table, Spin Drift, Sight Height, Printable Dope and BDC cards, the ability to compare loads, atmospheric conditions (manual entry or automatic import), wind direction, sight setting/zero calculator and much more. The program is capable of providing ballistic data out to 2,500 yards. The BDC card allows the shooter to print out a “cheat sheet” that can show the bullet drop at each magnification (for Second Focal Plane scopes) The Dope card provides velocity, energy, path, drop, wind drift, time of flight, # of click value and MOA or MRAD info in 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 yard increments. Weather/Atmospheric conditions can be automatically imported thanks to our direct link to World Weather Online, or you can manually enter the Temperature, Altitude, Barometric Pressure and Humidity through the Conditions section. The conditions section also allows the user to enter Bullet Wind Drift information such as wind speed and direction and provide data in inches, MOA or MRAD. The sight settings section is a great resource for shooters who would like to zero their rifle at a further distance then they are able to shoot. For example, if a user only has access to a 100-yard range but would like his rifle to be zeroed at 200 yards, the Sight Setting section will show the user where his bullet needs to impact on a 100-yard target to be zeroed at 200 yards. Our goal for this app is that it provides you with a comprehensive resource for everything and anything related to TRACT Optics…Where you Belong."

RacquetTune also allows you to check whether your stringer is consistent in his work. \nRacquetTune includes the following user-friendly tools:\n\nTension measurement \n- Quickly determines the tension and stringbed stiffness. \n- Able to detect changes in tension as small as 0.1 kg/0.2 lb.\n- An accuracy indicator ensures results are consistent. \n- Graphical presentation of sound waves helps you find the ideal way of tapping the strings. \n- Settings can be customized to serve tennis, squash, racquetball and badminton racquets, respectively. \n- View the tension history for each racquet as a list or a graph.\n- Email a spreadsheet with test data.\n\nSwingweight calculator \n- Add as many weights as you wish to the frame. \n- Move and change weights to visualize how swingweight, balance and sweet spot location are affected.\n- Enter target values for the racquet and let RacquetTune distribute the weights automatically.\n\nStiffness calculator \n- Simulate various racquet and string configurations\n- Vary tension, string type and racquet head size. \n- Shows load-displacement curves, stiffness and elastic energies \n- Handles the large deformations encountered in actual play \n\nView a demo video at racquettune.com\n\nRacquetTune has been featured in tennis magazines in USA, Italy, France, Germany, Sweden and Norway. \n\n\"The app is very, very impressive. I get more tension diagnostic questions than just about anybody in the universe, so this is a very good thing to be able to recommend.\" \nJonathan Wolfe \nUS Racquet Stringers Association\n\nNote, that the actual string tension in the racquet and the setting seen on a stringing machine are two different things and therefore incomparable - more information can be found at racquettune.com."

Determining the solunar period is therefore useful for activities such as birdwatching, fishing or hunting. There are two major and two minor solunar periods each day. The time at which each solunar occurs varies depending on the date and on your geographical location.\n\nThe app helps you to determine the solunar period and expected animal activity index (where 6-point is when animals are most active). It also tells you the exact sunrise, sunset, sun transit, moon rise, moon set, and moon transit times, alone with moon phase. The app can utilize your iPhone's build-in GPS to obtain your geographical location. In case you are using iTouch or without GPS signal, the app also accepts user input of longitude and latitude. \n\n\nFEATURES:\n.Locations: GPS or Manual Entry\n.Major & Minor Periods\n.Activity Index\n.Moonrise / Moonset Times\n.Moon Phase Data\n.Sunrise / Sunset Times\n.Sun Transit\n.Moon Transit\n.Day / Week View\n.Any Date\n.Any Location - Worldwide\n\nNo network is needed.

The app gives you duration, distance, speed and altitude as well as your exact position and track lines on a map while tracking.\n\nThe web site stores your tracks in an archive under your account that enables you to log in and view and edit your tracks. Using the app, you can be as anonymous as you like since you track under an Alias, and you can even set the tracks to be private (not listed or searchable on locatoweb.com). \n\nThe app only records your position when a track has been set up and started and lasts until you stop it. It is frequently used to track bicycle rides, road trips, hiking trips and other outdoor adventures where you want to show your friends and family where you are, or to simply track your adventures for your own pleasure.\n\nThere is also a safety aspect of using LocaToWeb. If you have the track running and something happens, your wife, husband and friends can see the exact location of where you are. Maybe you are riding your bike and falls off hitting your head, or you just want to be safe when walking home alone at night. \n\nKey features:\n\n- Share your position to web in real time\n- Monitor duration, distance, speed and altitude\n- See your exact position and track line on a map\n- Capture and upload photos while tracking\n- Set up race groups that tracks several participants\n- Choose your units system (metric/imperial)\n- Possible to keep the screen alive while tracking\n- Resume a track that has been stopped\n- View and edit your archived tracks anytime on the web site\n- Just install and track, no registering is required\n\nNote that continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

Calculations are provided for the best Trimix given a planned depth and a desired maximum partial pressure of oxygen and equivalent narcotic depth (END). You can also calculate the ceiling and maximum depths along with your END based on your planned mix. The dive planning tools support both salt water and fresh water calculations. The blending tools provide for filling a cylinder with a remaining mix (or empty) to a specified target mix using oxygen, helium and a topping mix (air or another available mix). You can also calculate the result of topping an existing partially filled cylinder with a specific topping mix (air or another available mix). There is also a Bleed Down calculator that allows you adjust an existing full or partially full cylinder to a new mix with minimal wasted gas. Trimix Tools supports calculations in both metric and Imperial/US systems of measure.\n\nTraveling on a boat or working out of network range? These tools are at hand any time you have your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch. You could, for example, easily calculate the result of topping your cylinder from your first dive with air from the boat's compressor to take advantage of any remaining mix. You also have the convenience of saved settings that you can recall at a touch and adjust to a new situation as needed.\n\nChances are you regularly work with a specific set of mixes and common dive situations. Trimix Tools includes the convenience of saved settings that you can recall and adjust to a new situation as needed. You can also select mix values using pre-installed default mixes or your own saved custom mixes. When updating one of the mixes for a tool you are offered a list of saved mixes that you can use directly or adjust as needed. You can save the currently displayed mix by tapping on the \"+\" button. Just like with the saved calculations, you can re-arrange or delete any mixes in your saved list.\n\nDo you need to share your planning or blending calculations with other divers? All the tools have the ability to share the results of the calculations from within the application. You can set default email addresses and a subject Trimix Tool's settings that will be automatically added when you share a result.\n\nAll END calculations (Dive Planning and Best Trimix tabs) in Trimix Tools treat oxygen as a narcotic gas by default. There is an option available under the Settings tab to change the default so that oxygen is not treated as narcotic if that is your preference. Remember you must always personally analyze your mix before diving it.\n\nThis application is not a substitute for proper training and should not be used as a substitute for proper dive planning or the primary Trimix blending and planning methods taught during training. Please do not attempt to handle high pressure oxygen or fill SCUBA cylinders without proper training."

It keeps track of all of the players on your team, where they are supposed to be on the field, and how long they've been playing since they were last substituted into the game.\n\nJust enter in your team name and your player roster. Drag your players on and off the field and tap the clock to start it running. Players on the field accrue elapsed time. Players off the field do not. It's that simple.\n\nWhat Coach's Clock does:\n\n* It tracks how much time has elapsed in the current play period.\n* It tracks the position of every player on your team.\n* It keeps track of how long each player has been on the field.\n* It helps you plan player substitutions.\n* It has field backgrounds for basketball, field hockey, football, hockey and soccer but it could also be used for any similar sport.\n* It supports an unlimited number of teams.\n* It has detailed usage instructions right inside the app.\n* It's a \"universal app\" so one purchase is good for all your iDevices!\n\nWhat it doesn't do:\n\n* Coach's Clock doesn't force you to keep the app running throughout your game. You are free to close it, open other apps, take phone calls, or whatever you like. You only need to run it when you want to refer to it or when you need to make a change. The clocks keep time even when the app isn't running.\n* Coach's Clock is not a replacement for your whiteboard or playbook. (There are plenty of other fine apps which can do that for you.)\n\nCoach's Clock may seem like a pretty simple app, and it is! But that's the beauty of it. It doesn't try to do everything for you; instead it tries to do a few essential things very well. It doesn't try to change the way you coach your team; it just makes your job a little easier."

Unfortunately measuring swing weight has been fairly complicated, until now. With SwingTool it is enough to just hang your equipment and let it swing like a pendulum. Place the iPhone close to the swinging end and it will automatically display the swing weight.\n\nCharacteristics\n- Can be used for all types equipment\n- Choose any point to calculate the swing weight at\n- Choose any point to hang the equipment at (independent of the swing point)\n- Faster and more accurate than the traditional way to measure swing weight\n- Can be used to measure the swing time of any pendulum with 0.01 s accuracy\n\nA demo video is available at appmaker.se/swingTool\n\nTo golfers: With this app you do MOI-matching i.e. it measures the real dynamic swing weight (moment of inertia). Not the static Lorythmic balance point (D9, C4 etc) that sometimes is called swing weight."

It has the same features and flexibility as the desktop app available from Pinwheel Software. \n\nYou can search by shaft manufacturer, shaft construction (aluminum, carbon, aluminum/carbon), and shaft usage (target, hunting, both).\n\nYou can search the database for a specific weight range for a completed arrow (with your components), a  shaft diameter range, or a specific percent FOC range.  Choose to include or omit discontinued shafts.\n\nFlexible, Accurate, Unique."

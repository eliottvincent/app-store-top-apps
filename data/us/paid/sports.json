      "label": "Avy savvy backcountry skiers and riders know that three things count when it comes to the terrain’s influence on avalanches: the slope, the elevation, and the (compass) aspect. And the Avalanche Inclinometer delivers all three. Sure, you can find plenty of inclinometer apps (also known as clinometers) that are designed for carpenters, but Steve's Avalanche Inclinometer is meant for people who spend time in avalanche terrain. \n\nThis app shows the slope, elevation, and aspect in BIG FONTS which are perfect for tired eyes in stormy (or bright-and-too-sunny) weather. And it doesn’t display a gaggle of tiny buttons and widgets to decipher when you should be skiing.\n\nYou can sight across a slope by holding your phone parallel to the slope, or you can sight up or down a slope by sighting along the long-edge of your phone like a gunsight. (Through-the-camera sighting is nifty when the light is just right, but it often isn't.)\n\nWhen you have your phone aligned with the slope, a single tap on the screen will lock the data so you can read it. The Avalanche Inclinometer will even speak to you as you’re measuring the steepness so you won’t need to look at the screen. And the BIG inclinometer dial changes colors based on the slope which provides instant feedback on how the steepness of the terrain is contributing to the likelihood of an avalanche.\n\nAfter measuring the slope, you can tap a single button to share your current GPS location, the slope in degrees, and the elevation. The email includes kml and gpx waypoint files, and a link that will let you quickly see the location in any browser. You can enter the email address one time and the Avalanche Inclinometer will remember it for next time. Less typing; more skiing.\n\nThe Avalanche Inclinometer isn’t free, but apps don’t grow on trees. To buy this app you’ll spend less than buying a beer at a ski resort—think of it as buying Steve a beer!\n\nIn addition to the Avalanche Inclinometer, it is important that you take an avy class, pay attention to the avalanche red flags, use good route finding techniques, and practice your avalanche rescue skills frequently"

By freedivers, for freedivers, our freedive apnea trainer helps you with static apnea tables and lung capacity training so you can effectively increase the time when diving underwater.\r\nSee why STAmina Apnea Trainer is one of the best apnea apps to improve the breath-holding time for freediving, scuba diving and spearfishing, as well as surfing, running, and other water sports with 6 different apnea tables types.\n\n\r\n■ FREEDIVING & SPEARFISHING APNEA TRAINER FEATURES:\n\n\r\n◉ 6 APNEA TABLE OPTIONS \r\nSTAmina Apnea Trainer can create / generate custom apnea (exercises that are automatically created based on the maximum breath-hold and match the user’s level) or let you select from the following customizable table types:\r\n\r\n- O2 deprivation table – accustoms a body to lower oxygen levels. This is achieved by increasing the amount of time that you hold your breath on each attempt, while the resting time is fixed.\r\n\r\n- CO2 Tolerance table – helps a body to adapt to high carbon dioxide levels. This is achieved by decreasing the length of resting time between fixed breath-hold periods.\r\n\r\n- Wonka table – a variation of CO2 tables. Apnea timer starts after the first contraction, the rest time takes one breath.\r\n\r\n- Mix table – tables where apnea time increases and rest time decreases with each round.\r\n\r\n- Custom table – allows mixing of different approaches to create a custom training, thus generating the most effective training program.\r\n\r\n- Pranayama – a breathing technique to decrease stress in the body and relax the nervous system.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ APPLE HEALTH SYNCRONIZATION \n\n\r\n\r\n◉ PERSONALIZED TRAINING WITH VARYING DIFFICULTY\r\nWhen you start working with the application, you set your personal record in breath holding. Based on this data, the app will offer a personalized training program with exercises of 3 difficulty levels to choose from: easy, normal, and hard.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ PERSONALIZED EXERCISE SETTINGS \r\nEach exercise can be edited by setting your own number of repetitions, breath hold time, rest time, etc.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ TRAINING REMINDERS \r\nGet the notification to start your apnea training. Set a reminder in the apnea diver app for the day and the time & get a notification to do a breath holding training session.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ PERSONAL STATISTICS AND DETAILED TRAINING HISTORY\r\nAll your workouts and exercises are recorded in the freedive trainer app to track the detailed progress of each training.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ VOICE GUIDANCE\r\nTraining may be accompanied by voice guidance with male/female voices recorded by professional voice actors. STAmina supports English, French, Russian voice guidance.\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n◉ HEART RATE AND OXYGEN SATURATION TRACKING\r\nTrack your heart rate while doing breath holding exercises (a compatible HR monitor or pulse-oximeter is required) \n\n\r\n\r\n◉ CONTRACTIONS TRACKING \r\nUse our freedive trainer to track unlimited contractions, analyse captured data after exercises\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ CLOUD SYNC / BACKUP\r\nAccess your data on multiple devices and easily restore it in case you switch devices/phones.\n\n\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\nStamina Apnea Trainer allows training breath hold effectively for anyone who cares about all kinds of diving including:\r\n> beginner or professional freedivers;\r\nspearfishers;\r\n> scuba divers to learn how to dive longer on one tank;\r\n> surfers in case of unexpected breath hold;\r\n> underwater sports athletes such as underwater rugby, hockey, etc.\r\n> runners who want to train breath holding & high tolerance to CO2 while running\r\n\r\n_______\r\nInfo https://getstamina.app/\r\nContact https://www.facebook.com/staminamobile/\r\nSupport hello@squarecrowdapps.com"

      "label": "Used by beginners through Major Championship winners on the PGA Tour, and validated by an Independent Scientific Study by the Departments of Physics and Biomechanics at Yale University.\n\nThe Tour Tempo Total Game allows you to learn how to correctly integrate the Tempo of the Tour Pros into your golf swing. Over 100,000 golfers worldwide, including Major Championship winners on the PGA Tour, have improved their games by using Tour Tempo.  \n\n\"In all the reviews I've written for MyGolfSpy (a number now pushing up on 100), I'd only given one perfect score. Now Tour Tempo can be added to that most-elite company. Tour Tempo is scientifically proven, it's easy to use, and it will help you in every facet of the game.\" \n— GolfSpy Matt: http://www.mygolfspy.com/tour-tempo-review\n\n\"It will be the best thing that you will ever do for your game.\" \n— Pat Dempsey, 2011 RE/MAX World Long Drive Grand Champion 55+\n\n\"You will get better right away! When you synch your swing to that of the Tour Pros with Tour Tempo, you’ll get better right now!\" \n— Dan Rooney, Folds of Honor\n\n\"The Unified Theory of Tempo\" \n— Golf Digest \n\n\"No one has ever come up with a way to teach Tempo until now.\"\n— Travel + Leisure Golf \n\nBased on the international best selling golf book, Tour Tempo. The book outlines and explains the discovery of a specific mathematical ratio regarding the elapsed time of the backswing and the elapsed time of the downswing of the Tour Pros. The Tour Tempo System is simple and easy to learn. All you do is react to three scientifically spaced musical notes. These musical notes alert you to start your takeaway, start your downswing, and then the third note lines you up with impact. It’s just that easy - you literally download the app, turn it on, grab a club and start swinging to the Tempo of the Tour Pros.\n\nLONG GAME\nThe Long Game Tones will teach you how to swing with the tempo ratio exhibited by the Tour Pros. We measured the time of their backswings and downswings by counting how many frames of video each part took. The magic ratio on full swings turned out to be three parts backswing to one part downswing. Tones are provided for each of the following frame ratios of Tour Tempo - 18/6, 21/7, 24/8 & 27/9. The Tour Tempo Tones have a clear purpose. They establish the intrinsic tempo of the golf swing in your subconscious mind. Once this is accomplished, you will not have to think about tempo while playing. This is what the Tour Pros have already done. You are about to acquire that same ability.\n\nSHORT GAME\nThe Total Game App also contains the Short Game Tones of 14/7, 16/8, 18/9 & 20/10. After the publication of Tour Tempo, John Novosel studied the short game swings of the top touring pros, and discovered that virtually all of them employ a 2 to 1 swing ratio on or around the greens - a different Tempo than the 3 to 1 ratio of the Long Game. This is another reason why the game of golf is so hard to master.      \n\nTEMPO TRACKS\nThe Tempo Tracks are an easy way to integrate Tour Tempo into your daily routine. One of the best ways to use the Tracks is to listen to them while driving to the course before a round of golf. The more you listen to them, the more the Tour Tempo rhythm will be ingrained into your Golf Swing. \n\nFOCUS TRACKS\nThe Focus Tracks are revolutionary relaxation songs that contain the Tones of Tour Tempo. Each Track has a Part II that has binaural tones embedded in the music to get your brain into an optimum state for concentration. This optimum state is more commonly known to athletes as “Being in the Zone.”\n\nVIDEOS\nThe videos give a complete explanation of the Tones and how to use them to immediately and dramatically improve your Total Game.  \n\nDISCOUNT\nThe app is your first step towards a more powerful, consistent golf game, and that is why we are giving you a discount from our Tour Tempo Shop. On the 'Info' screen you will find a one-time discount code good for $10 off on a future purchase at TourTempo.com and TourTempo.eu."

      "label": "Listen to your racquet and perfect your game!\n\nRacquetTune ensures that your racquet is ideally suited to your style of play. Simple and straightforward to use, the app uses the sound generated by tapping the strings to calculate the tension with high accuracy. In addition, the interactive swingweight calculator aids in customizing your racquet to fit your own stroke pattern, while the stiffness calculator allows you to simulate different racquet configurations. \n\nRacquetTune not only makes it easier to decide when it is time to restring, it is also an invaluable tool when testing different racquets and strings and in identifying which of your racquets is best suited for different types of games. RacquetTune also allows you to check whether your stringer is consistent in his work. \nRacquetTune includes the following user-friendly tools:\n\nTension measurement \n- Quickly determines the tension and stringbed stiffness. \n- Able to detect changes in tension as small as 0.1 kg/0.2 lb.\n- An accuracy indicator ensures results are consistent. \n- Graphical presentation of sound waves helps you find the ideal way of tapping the strings. \n- Settings can be customized to serve tennis, squash, racquetball and badminton racquets, respectively. \n- View the tension history for each racquet as a list or a graph.\n- Email a spreadsheet with test data.\n\nSwingweight calculator \n- Add as many weights as you wish to the frame. \n- Move and change weights to visualize how swingweight, balance and sweet spot location are affected.\n- Enter target values for the racquet and let RacquetTune distribute the weights automatically.\n\nStiffness calculator \n- Simulate various racquet and string configurations\n- Vary tension, string type and racquet head size. \n- Shows load-displacement curves, stiffness and elastic energies \n- Handles the large deformations encountered in actual play \n\nView a demo video at racquettune.com\n\nRacquetTune has been featured in tennis magazines in USA, Italy, France, Germany, Sweden and Norway. \n\n\"The app is very, very impressive. I get more tension diagnostic questions than just about anybody in the universe, so this is a very good thing to be able to recommend.\" \nJonathan Wolfe \nUS Racquet Stringers Association\n\nNote, that the actual string tension in the racquet and the setting seen on a stringing machine are two different things and therefore incomparable - more information can be found at racquettune.com."

      "label": "Flyskyhy forms your flight instrument during flight and shows all information you need for that. You get the normal data like altitude, climb rate, ground speed, and glide angle. But it also calculates and shows the current wind direction and strength, very important for your safety.\n\nA moving and rotating map shows your current flying position and flight trail. It indicates where you have gone up (in a thermal), and where you have had faster than normal decline. With that, you can easily find back that thermal that you lost. The map also shows the nearest known landing spots, and whether they are reachable by normal glide, given your current altitude and wind direction.\n\nIntegration with Bluetooth varios SensBox, FlyNet, GoFly iPico, XC-Tracer, BlueFlyVario, or SkyDrop gives accurate altitude and lift information. That turns your iPhone into an full-fletched GPS-vario, including vario tones.\n\nThe app makes a full log of your flight, that can be analyzed afterwards. Besides normal data like start and landing positions, duration of flight, and an altitude graph of the flight, Flyskyhy also calculates the scoring distances for you. So you can immediately see whether you have broken that FAI triangle record.\n\nYour live location is reported on livetrack24.com or loctome.com if you desire, so anybody can follow your flight while it is happening. If you are flying together with friends, then their location is shown on your map during your flight. So you never have to wonder anymore whether they are in front of or behind you.\n\nThe flight display has multiple screens which are all fully configurable. You can move all elements to other spots, delete and add elements, and resize them.\n\nThrough in-app purchases, the app also supports airspaces and waypoints.\n\nThe app is optimised for paragliding and hang gliders, but can be used with all  kinds of airsports.\n\nMain features during the flight;\n• Altitude, climb rate, ground speed, air speed, direction, glide angle and many more\n• Wind strength and direction\n• Moving map of the flying area\n• Spots where you have had lift, great for thermal coring\n• Shows whether you can still reach a landing spot with the current altitude and wind\n• Live tracking of your flight on livetrack24.com or loctome.com\n• Shows live location of your friends during flight\n\nAfter the flight:\n• Full logbook of all your flights\n• Basic flight data like start/landing, duration, height difference, distance flown, and many more\n• Calculation of 5-points, open triangle, and FAI triangle distances\n• Graph of altitude and climb rate\n• Signed IGC and KML log files of flights\n• Transfer the log to iTunes or send by email\n• Upload the flight directly to XContest, ParaglidingForum, DHV-XC, and other Leonardo servers\n• Open flight in Google Earth on the iPhone\n• Replay the flight and relive it!\n\nBy purchasing the Waypoints Extension you get access to:\n• A fully zoomable and scrollable map with the waypoints and optimised route. The map also shows start and landing spots, as well as restricted airspaces (with the Airspace Extension)\n• Enter new waypoints, either on the map or by specifying the parameters\n• Full route support with start time, goal, entry/exit points, etc. \n• Many instruments to guide you along the route\n• Visible and audible indication when a waypoint has been reached\n• Complete waypoints organiser\n• Import and export of various waypoint file formats\n\nBy purchasing the Airspace Extension you get access to:\n• Airspaces of 30 countries\n• Display of airspaces on the map with configurable colors and formats\n• Display of your vertical position w.r.t. airspaces\n• Visible and audible warnings when approaching and entering an airspace\n• Shows local airspaces by touching a spot on the map\n\nNote: a live internet connection is required for live tracking of your and your friends locations\nNote: continuous GPS and screen usage makes the battery drain faster than normal"

      "label": "THE BEST VIDEO REPLAY APP!\n- Number 1 in the Sports iPad Category!!!\n- Trusted by the US major league baseball and basketball teams.\n\nAre you frustrated by making the same mistakes and wasting time on your practice? Video Delay Instant Replay is a fantastic way for athletes to receive instant feedback on their performance. Analyze your form, build good muscle memory, and get faster results. \n\nMake every practice satisfying and effective!\n\nThere are three main features: the DELAY, the SLO-MO, and the REPLAY.\n\nThe DELAY Mode continuously shows the delayed video during practice. After setting the buffer time, there's no need to record and replay manually. The video feedback will be on until you reset the buffer or hit the exit button.\n\nThe SLO-MO Mode captures a short video and instantly replays it in slow motion. It works best for quick activities, like punch or shoot. To adjust the speed rate, use the slider. The recording will get you short slow-motion videos of every repetition. \n\nThe REPLAY View* allows frame-by-frame analysis of athlete moves, including measuring the angles. You can also export a short part of the replay video using AB selection.\n* It works only with Delay mode and a buffer time longer than 1 second.\n\nImprove your skills and get faster results:\n1. Set the Buffer time.\n2. Do your action.\n3. Watch the video feedback.\n4. Immediately correct your posture and repeat!\n\nCoaches and teachers! \nUse the app with an external screen for even better feedback during practice! Watch the Replay video with your team, analyze your players' performance, and correct errors. Add lines on the screen to check out the angles. Trim the video, so it only shows what you want your students to concentrate on. Record only necessary parts of the practice. Instant Feedback also helps to settle disputes between players.\n\nBasketball, baseball, and football players! \nPractice by repetition -  improve your shooting form by copying your favorite players' moves. Make out the best of your hitting drill. Take a quick look at the footage, correct your posture, and return to the action. No need to rewind or touch the device; the video will play instantly. You will be able to see if your pose is good and if your fake moves are effective. \n\nGolf and tennis players! \nUse a motion-detection grid and correct your swing or backhand instantly! Perform proper movements and maintain good posture while exercising. Build better muscle memory and improve your game!\n\nTraining martial arts, archery, or shooting? \nStudy your form with delayed video feedback. Set a short delay time and analyze your moves in slow motion. See what to correct in your kicks or punches.\n\nPilates or yoga fan? \nCheck out poses you won’t see in the mirror, like dog or pigeon. Make sure you are true to form and protect yourself from injury.\n\nActors and performers!\nReplay yourself performing and improve your acting skills. Check out your gestures in slow-motion and make them the best!\n\nFor information on how to use the VDIR, please check out the User Guide in the app!"

      "label": "The TRACT Optics Impact Ballistics mobile application takes the guesswork out of long-range shooting and provides data to help the most experienced shooter as well as the beginner or novice. This mobile application is one of the most comprehensive databases of information available today. With virtually every modern ammunition manufacturer’s information listed shooters can match any TRACT rifle scope reticle to their exact cartridge. Simply select your scope, then your ammo/bullet the program will calculate the bullet drop information as it pertains to your reticle automatically. If you cannot find your particular round of ammunition in the program, simply add the Ballistic Coefficient (B.C.) and Muzzle Velocity to the program and you will be good to go. With the ability to import current weather conditions the Impact program will provide up to date Bullet Drop Compensation to help you make accurate shots in the field or at the range. While the mobile application is designed to provide ballistic date without an internet connection, when the user has an internet connection, they are able to access our complete library of videos, articles, and blogs. Simply navigate to the Learn section of the app and you can access the Getting Started section for Rifle Scopes, Binoculars and Spotting Scopes as well as Pro Shooting Tips with videos detailing How To videos showing how to maximize the performance of your optic. You can even shop our complete line of Optics and Accessories right from the App. This app will be continually updated with new ammunition information, new product releases and videos. Selectable options include Meters or Yards, Drag Table, Spin Drift, Sight Height, Printable Dope and BDC cards, the ability to compare loads, atmospheric conditions (manual entry or automatic import), wind direction, sight setting/zero calculator and much more. The program is capable of providing ballistic data out to 2,500 yards. The BDC card allows the shooter to print out a “cheat sheet” that can show the bullet drop at each magnification (for Second Focal Plane scopes) The Dope card provides velocity, energy, path, drop, wind drift, time of flight, # of click value and MOA or MRAD info in 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 yard increments. Weather/Atmospheric conditions can be automatically imported thanks to our direct link to World Weather Online, or you can manually enter the Temperature, Altitude, Barometric Pressure and Humidity through the Conditions section. The conditions section also allows the user to enter Bullet Wind Drift information such as wind speed and direction and provide data in inches, MOA or MRAD. The sight settings section is a great resource for shooters who would like to zero their rifle at a further distance then they are able to shoot. For example, if a user only has access to a 100-yard range but would like his rifle to be zeroed at 200 yards, the Sight Setting section will show the user where his bullet needs to impact on a 100-yard target to be zeroed at 200 yards. Our goal for this app is that it provides you with a comprehensive resource for everything and anything related to TRACT Optics…Where you Belong."

      "label": "Dive Log is designed to work either as your primary SCUBA diving logbook application or in conjunction with compatible 3rd party desktop logbook applications. You can use Dive Log at the dive site or on the dive boat to capture the information about the site while it is fresh in your mind (or your dive guide's mind). You can even capture the GPS coordinates of the dive site using the built in location services of your iOS device. Details about your actual dive can be added immediately after your dive or at the après dive event and later be saved to your desktop computer. The dive buddy feature is fully integrated with Contacts on your iPhone or iPad, letting you capture information about your newest dive buddy or quickly add an existing buddy to a particular dive. The dive data and statistics features let you have an immediate answer the next time your dive guide asks how much weight you used on your last dive or have all the information you need about your dive history when you fill out that next dive waiver.  Metric and Imperial values are supported for all appropriate logbook fields. You can easily enter values using the appropriate units for the situation and view them in your preferred measurement system. You can even explore detailed dive profiles from popular dive computers that you download with your desktop software and later upload to Dive Log on iPhone/iPad. Dive profile data can also be transferred directly from certain dive computers directly via Bluetooth or using a supported Bluetooth accessory and an associated in-app purchase.  \n\nOn Windows, Diving Log 6.0 (www.divinglog.de) is fully integrated with Dive Log on iPhone/iPad and has built in synchronization. Diving Log 6.0 has extensive support for importing data from dive computers and other dive log applications. \n\nOn Mac OS X, logbook information can be imported to Dive Log on iPhone/iPad from a number of compatible applications using the free Dive Log Manager application available from More Mobile Software (www.moremobilesoftware.com/divelog-sync). Dive Log DT (available on the Mac App Store) can be used to directly import a number of dive computers and file formats and can synchronize with Dive Log on iOS.\n\nDive data can be directly downloaded on a Bluetooth LE (Bluetooth 4.0) compatible iPhone, iPad or iPod touch from Bluetooth LE capable dive computers such as the Suunto EON Steel, Suunto EON Core, Suunto D5, Scubapro Galileo 2 (G2), Aladin Sport (Matrix), Aladin H (Matrix), G2 HUD, Aladin A1, Shearwater Teric, Peregrine, Petrel 2, Perdix, Perdix AI, NERD 2, Oceanic VTX, Pro Plus 4, Geo 4.0, VEO 4.0, Aeris A300CS, Aqualung i300C, i550C, i750TC, i770R, Sherwood Wisdom 4, Mares Genius and certain heinrichs weikamp OSTC computers as well as the DiveNav Inc. bluebuddy and Tech Buddy dive logger accessories. Supported Bluetooth LE accessories are available separately.\n\nMares Bluelink Pro is a Bluetooth LE accessory by Mares and available for purchase separately (www.mares.com). The Bluelink Pro allows you transfer dive data from certain Mares dive computers (Puck Pro, Smart, Smart Air, Quad and Quad Air) directly to Dive Log on your Bluetooth LE (Bluetooth 4.0) compatible iPhone, iPad or iPod touch.\n\nDive Computer Buddy (aka DCbuddy) is a Bluetooth LE accessory by DiveNav Inc. (note that the DCbuddy itself is no longer available). The DCbuddy allows you transfer dive data from certain dive computers (including models from Suunto, Oceanic, Aqualung, Aeris, Sherwood, Tusa and Mares) directly to Dive Log on your Bluetooth LE (Bluetooth 4.0) compatible iPhone, iPad or iPod touch."

Tap the screen once again after your break and the app will display your Break Speed speed.\n\nBreak Speed is more than 10x the accuracy of a radar gun and has become the standard for break shot speed measurements, privately and professionally. With such high precision, you can use Break Speed to provide that feedback you need to improve your breaks. Break harder and more consistently with Break Speed.\n\nDon't worry about others breaking around you or other pool hall noise. Even shouting players won't fool our Break Recognition technology.\n\nFind out why professional pool players are using and recommending Break Speed to others.\n\nOur collaboration with Predator has been very effective. It's been great to work with a team that understands the science of billiards. The Predator R&D team has been testing the application along side their own speed measurement equipment and the Iron Willie robot,  following a number of testing sessions, the Predator R&D team found the application so accurate that a partnership in pool science began.\n\n\"The application is really spot on. During my many testing sessions with the Predator Team there was very little deviation between the Predator testing equipment and the application,\" said Predator Pro Mike Dechaine.\n\nIf you're a serious player, and you don't have Break Speed Powered By Predator, what are you waiting for?"

Also it includes a module which allows you to time relay events.\n\nKeeps all your events history for later review and analysis. Each performance can be shared by email or shared in the different social networks. Allows you to time multiple athletes at the same time.\n\nIt allows you to Import/Export athletes. This is useful when you have a big roaster of athletes and needs to be imported to the app. Also if you have the app installed in different devices (iPad and iPhone), it facilitates the process of keeping on sync the roaster. \n\nIt allows to predefine Teams of athletes (before the meet). These teams, along with individual athletes, are available to pick from when using the app during meets; these expedite you the process of timing events during the meet.\n\nSmart Stop feature: because this app has preloaded the events, it knows exactly when the final lap is, so it will stop the stopwatch at the end of the final lap, regardless of the button you use (lap or stop). For Individual events, splits can be set at the 200m mark or 400m mark based on your preferences. When splits are set to 200m, it also allows you to use this app for indoor events. This application also supports hurled events, allowing to record splits per hurdle (touch downs), including support for events with 4, 5, 8 or 10 hurdles.\n\nBecause StopWatch for Track and Field knows the event characteristics, you can record: \n\n-The distance for each split \n-The estimated time at the finish line!! \n-The estimated time of your relay team \n-The Individual splits per leg in relay events\n\nVisit our website to see our demo videos: http://goo.gl/ymuFQ or follow us in Twitter @StopWatchTF\n\nIf you have question, suggestions, issues, before writting it in a review, first don't hesitate to contact us to stopwatchtf@gmail.com"

      "label": "An extensive overhaul of the app is now complete, making a 4.5/5 star app even better! This upgrade is packed with lots of new features and a new interface that supports both portrait and landscape modes.\n\nWith iTouchStats Basketball, you are in control over how much data you want to track.  The most popular method is to track individual player stats for one team while tracking just the opponent's team stats, as shown in the 1st screen shot.  Or you can track individual player stats for both teams, as shown in the 2nd screen shot.  Which stats you track for each team is up to you.   Even the use of the game clock and shot location tracking are optional.  \n\nA unique feature of iTouchStats Basketball is the quick stat icons that appear next to a player's photo or jersey.  These icons coordinate with the stat button colors, giving you an easy way to see a player's key stats without needing to leave the main scoring screen.  Icons include: Points (Green), Fouls (Red), Turnovers (Orange), Assists (Yellow), Steals (Gray), and Blocks (Brown).  By double-tapping on a player, you can get even more stat details including shot charts and shooting percentages.\n \nNEW ▸▸  One of the coolest features added in v4.0 is the team bench that appears at the bottom of the score keeping screen.  The bench greatly improves player subbing and also gives you easy access to viewing the stats of the players not in the game.  You can even register a stat to a player on the bench if a sub-in was missed.\n \nNEW ▸▸  User Definable Rating System (This system has the ability to give individual values to each stat, allowing a quick easy way for a coach or parent to see how a player performed in a game based on these values.)\n\nNEW ▸▸  User Definable Stat Button (This definable stat button can also be turned off in the game reports.)\n\nNEW ▸▸  Team quick stats are displayed in the scoreboard. \n \nNEW ▸▸  iCloud Data Backups\n\nNEW ▸▸  Half Timeouts have been added as an option.\n\nNEW ▸▸  Running Clock is an added Rules option.\n\nIMPROVED ▸▸  Game and season PDF reports.  Not only has the look improved, but you can now choose which stats are displayed on PDF reports.  For example, if the game clock is not used and deflections are not tracked, then you can turn these fields off in PDF reports.\n\nIMPROVED ▸▸  Stat viewing options.  You can now view a team or player(s) stats by periods.  For example, you could use this to compare how your starters did in the 2nd half vs. the 1st half.  You could even do this over multiple games!\n    \nIMPROVED ▸▸  Season, Team, and Player management.  For users who track multiple seasons, you will now only see data relating to your \"Default\" season, but changing between seasons can be done easily. \n\n▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸\nDETAILED STAT LIST\n▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸\n▸ 2-Point, 3-Point, Free Throws, Field Goals (Made, Attempts, and % for each) \n ▸ Rebounds (Offensive, Defensive, Dead Ball)  \n▸ Assists  \n▸ Blocks  \n▸ Steals  \n▸ Turnovers (optional Forced or Unforced: Out of Bounds, Lost Ball, Ball Handling, Bad Pass, Back Court, 3 Sec, 5 Sec, 10 Sec, Shot Clock, Other)  \n▸ Fouls (optional: Offensive, Defensive, Flagrant, Team Technical, Player Technical)  \n▸ Charges Taken \n▸ Deflections   \n▸ Forced Jump Balls \n ▸ Efficiency (Stat formula taken from http://www.nba.com/statistics/efficiency.html) \n▸ Rating (User Definable Rating System)\n ▸ Minutes Played  \n▸ Games (Started, Played)  \n▸ User Definable Stat Button\n\n▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸\nView app videos and download sample PDF reports at iTouchStats.com\n▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸"

      "label": "Belt Level: Low-white to low-purple.\nEmphasis: Safer training, less injuries and more fun for the more mature Jiu Jitsu Practitioners!\n\nWhile there certainly are a ton of instructionals out there for tournament competitors, the Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Over 40 instructional app breaks new ground by focusing on the needs of practitioners who are close to or over the age of forty, have the responsibilities of family and career waiting for them immediately following class and have major concerns regarding the frequency and severity of injuries while sparring. For many of these practitioners, Jiu Jitsu is simply a fun hobby used to help them stay in shape, relieve stress, keep their mind sharp, make friends and have fun!\n\nThe Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Over 40 instructional app will help these “mature practitioners” lower the frequency and severity of injuries associated with grappling with other practitioners who are ten to twenty years younger than themselves. It will also help them to accomplish their goals through minimized and well timed movements.\n\nSeven areas are addressed on this instructional:\n\nI. Introduction and theory\nII. Fundamental movements\nIII. Defensive postures\nIV. Defensive positioning\nV. Fundamental techniques\nVI. Submission escapes\nVII. How to train\n\nThe fundamental movements section focuses on the most important movements within Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. I stress the importance of “Fundamental Movements” because they lay the foundation of the art. When I write the words “Fundamental Movements”, I am referring to a specific group of movements that are used most often by middle to high level practitioners. For example, horizontal and vertical hip movements are the foundation for any grappling method.\n\nThe defensive postures section is designed to be combined with the defensive positioning and fundamental techniques sections. The combination of these three sections will not only lower the frequency and severity of injuries, but they will also lower the amount of energy the “Over 40 practitioner” will put into his or her overall game!\n\nThe defensive postures will show you how and where to place your arms into a position that will make it hard for your opponent to gain any leverage over your arm or neck without taking his or her weight off of your body.\n\nDefensive positioning will show you how to position your body in such a way as to get the opponent to move in a predictable manner (e.g. forcing him to take his weight off of you so that it will be physically easier for you to escape).\n\nFinally, the defensive postures and positioning, when combined with the ten (10) fundamental techniques taught on this instructional, will lower the amount of force you use to accomplish your objectives. Lowering the amount of energy used to accomplish a specific objective should be the eventual goal for every Over 40 practitioner!\n\nThe next section is an important one: Submission escapes. However, I don’t want you (the more mature practitioner) to miss the main point of this section: My goal in presenting this information was not just so you could tap less often. Rather, the goal was to help you to lower the frequency of injuries associated with sparring with the young and the aggressive students at your academy.\n\nFinally, in the last chapter of the instructional app, I show you how to train. I teach a few methods of combining the movements, techniques, training methods and strategies mentioned in this instructional into something that will not only lower the frequency and severity of injuries, but will also lower the amount of energy you expend to accomplish your objectives and show you how to get more enjoyment out of your Jiu Jitsu training!"

The same old stickhandling drills get boring and you can't afford a private stickhandling instructor. Well.... you can now!\n\nDangleTime is your private stickhandling coach on your phone. Anytime you want to work on your stickhandling just pull out your phone and get training. \n\nThe app keeps track of your \"DangleTime\" which is the amount of time you spend practicing using the app. This time can be shared and compared with friends. Who can get the highest DangleTime? The higher your DangleTime the more you can level up, go from a Duster to an All-Star!\n\nThe app comes with 3 free training packs. Each training pack contains 8 stickhandling drills. When you select a training pack a drill will play for 20 seconds with a 10 second break and then the next drill will play until all drills in that pack have played. These times can be adjusted in the settings menu. \n\nIf you'd like more stickhandling drills you can purchase them and continue to challenge yourself and improve your stickhandling. \nAll drills are demonstrated by Jeremy Rupke from How To Hockey with plans to add new drill packs from more hockey instructors. \n\nShow me your DangleTime with #DangleTime on Instagram and Twitter and follow me @howtohockey"

Wouldn’t it be great to be able to dive deeply with one big breath and take incredible pictures for your friends at home? The Apnea Trainer makes it possible! By using it to train three times a week, you can quickly double your underwater time.\n\nThis is the same training principle used by apnea divers. It’s based on a yoga technique which strengthens the diaphragm muscles allowing you to fill your lungs with more oxygen and releasing more carbon dioxide while exhaling. The system is relatively simple and depends on finding the right time intervals which are provided by the program, thus letting you relax and concentrate on your breathing. This will guarantee maximum training success.\nThe program will also come in handy just before the actual dive since a pranayama mode is already included. The Apnea Trainer will help you keep your whole body calm and give you the perfect preparation for those amazing, long-lasting dives. \n\n\nFeatures:\n+ Training to improve free diving time\n\n+ Pranayama mode to calm your body before diving or snorkeling\n\n+ Custom time settings for pro divers\n\n+ Optical and Audio instructions\n\n+ Easy to use interface\n\nUpdated user interface with the help of Bjoern Maser by www.minimalist.ch."

No worries, add as many teams as you like, and Next Batter Up will keep everything organized and ready.\n\n- Add Players to a Team:  Adding players becomes painless with an awesome audio trimming slider, haptic feedback, and pinpoint buttons that let you get to the exact millisecond in the song that your player wants.  We also support typing in times for players who tell you their exact start and end times.  On the players screen, you can reorder players to match your lineup.  \n\n- Add custom recorded player announcements like \"Next Batter Up, #10, Rylie Hart!\". With the ability to also blend your recorded announcement with the song of your choosing.\n\n- Add custom Text-To-Speech announcements using Apple's Enhanced Voices!  Voices include: Ava, Samantha, Tom, Kate, Lee, Daniel, Serena, Allison, or Susan\n\n- Upload your own player introduction and mash it with a song.\n\n- Upload/Record Game Announcements so that you won't forget later.\n\n- Share your lineup with other parents/friends/coaches/students!  We'll even send them your custom introductions! (via airdrop/email)\n\n- Save your lineup configuration for later use.\n\n- Fade in/Fade Out options.\n\n- Bench Players that are not in your lineup for the current game.\n\n- Playlists:  Create playlists to match your needs.  Need one for pregame warmups?  No problem!  How about ceremonial music?  Practice?  Just won the championship game?  Dad's birthday party?\n\nSupported Music:  Next Batter Up requires the use of Apple Music, and those songs must be downloaded to your device in order to utilize them within the app.  Apple Subscription Service Compatible.

App records a punch motion at the inertial frame of reference using gyroscope and accelerometer data and saves the punch.\nAll information about a punch is revealed now.\nGraph of speed and all the punch rates: acceleration, distance, power, duration, reaction time.\nOn speed graph you can see how your punch accelerates and swing as first peak if it exists.\nYou can record another punch to make a comparison, or you can share your punch.\nYou can choose appropriate units: kilograms or pounds, kilometers per hour or meters per second and etc.\nYou can record any kind of punch and not only the punch but any motion of your body.\n\nTechnical data:\n\nOn iPhone 4S application can’t work properly. Punch speed on iPhone 4S may be 2 times lower, but duration and reaction time are still correct. App works perfectly on iPhone 5, iPhone 5s, iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6S, iPhone 6S Plus, iPhone SE. But it may be not that easy to grip iPhone 6 Plus or  iPhone 6S Plus when you punch.\n\nSpeed measurement error is not more than 5% in most cases. Maximum acceleration is about 16g. Power is calculated approximately, with special formula based on your skills level, punch speed, and your mass. Put your mass in a punch to get more accurate result. Distance is calculated with small deviation when you punch the air. You get a straight distance between punch starting point and punch ending point. Time accuracy is limited to 10 ms.\n\nWarning! Use this app only at your own risk! Make sure that you hold your iPhone strong enough and be careful when you punch! Developer disclaims any responsibility."

      "label": "Dive Plan is a digital decompression table and log book, made using general public information, most compatible with PADI, SSI, SDI, NAUI, NAVI diving tables, and it is comparable with most of the other current diving organizations and their dive tables. Recreational dive planners are decompression tables in which non-stop time under water is calculated. The Dive Planner can be used to practice for your dive certification exams, and can be used as a general guide for planning dives, and logging your dives so you never forget what to enter into your paper log book. \n\nDive Plan works for diving with air (21% Oxygen) filled tanks, as well as enriched air (nitrox from 21% to 40% oxygen). Please note that when diving on an altitude, special considerations must be taken into account, and different dive tables should be used.\n\nDive computers use much more sophisticated algorithms for calculated non-decmpression limits, based on the whole dive, whereas the recreational dive tables are much more conservative and assume a square profile dive where the diver spends the entire dive at one depth."

No more writing everything down on a pieces of paper to be lost in your range bag.  When your friends ask about the loads you are using, you can pull out Chronograph Log and give them accurate info instead of guessing.  Send them an email or message on the spot.  Share your favorite loads via eMail, Facebook and more.\n\nChronograph Log was primarily developed for USPSA IPSC and IDPA, where Minor and Major Power Factors are very important.  It will color code those entries based on their velocities.  Note that the Power Factors can be ignored if you are tracking rifle loads or don’t care about Power Factors.\n\nNote: This application is not a chronograph.  You will need to enter readings from your chronograph into the Chronograph Log app.\n\n• Define: Bullets, Guns and Powder in the database.\n• Record velocities for each round from your chronograph.\n• Automatically calculate Average, Min and Max velocities.\n• Color coding to show each velocity’s Power Factor.\n• Export full tables to Mail.\n• Export favorite loads to Messages, Mail, Twitter or Facebook.\n• Backup / Restore to Dropbox.\n• Bluetooth integration with Competition Electronics \"ProChrono Digital\" using their \"Digital Link\" module."

It happened to me and to my fishing buddy, so I decided to write this app. The truth is also that to find the right length considering all the factors: the size, the ring, the line, the plates... while driving the boat, putting lines to the water, trying to not hook ourselves, looking at the sonar, trying to get the thermocline depth, adding waypoint when seeing fishes, listening radio for other reports is difficult to say the least. 9 years ago, smartphones were only starting to be in all fishermen pocket but now it is clearly in all pockets. \n\nDipsies have a very simple data table, while the two values per cell, with or without the ring, make it clearly more difficult to read. But some of the other divers have larger and more complex data tables with tens of columns and rows and even many pages. Now that apps are omnipresent, it was the right time to do another version with more divers."

Do you get bored in the arena and need to help finding new ways to keep both you and your horse entertained?\n\nIf the answer is yes to any of the above then you need the Polework Patterns by Fancy Footwork Equestrian app in your life! \n\nThis app includes 40 different layouts (20 main and 20 random) which are designed to be multi directional and use between one and twenty poles. There are several unique features including:\n\n- the option to search for layouts based on the amount of poles you want to use:\n   • 1–5 poles\n   • 6–10 poles \n   • 11–15 poles \n   • 16–20 poles \n\n- the option to search for exercises based on what area of a horse’s development you want to focus on – here you will find 15 categories including \n   • Balance \n   • Core \n   • Engagement \n   • Response to rider \n   • ... and more!\n\n- a random button which can be used if you can’t decide which layout to go for, or if you like to live a little dangerously! Either way press that random button, watch the poles spin, the confetti fall and then marvel as your layout is revealed! \n\n- all of the layouts have different suggested exercises to use (four options for the main layouts and two options for the random layouts), each of which are colour-coded to show which pace to use, and a proposed difficulty rating attached to help you decide if that exercise is suitable to your horse’s stage of training.\n\n- 120 potential exercises with four suggestions given per exercise as to what areas it could help your horse improve on. (Flexibility, straightness etc) \n\n- a “Favourites” folder where you can add any of the 80 exercises used in the core layouts for quick and easy access.\n\nPolework patterns was developed by the creator of Fancy Footwork Equestrian, Nina Gill. Nina is a qualified coach who runs Polework clinics full-time and is passionate about her work and the many benefits of polework. This passion has led to Fancy Footwork Equestrian collaborating with some of the U.K.’s biggest equestrian YouTubers and influencers, as well as having Polework training articles printed in three of the biggest equine magazines to date. \nWith this app you will never run out of Polework ideas, even the biggest layouts have been designed to be broken down into smaller sections so that those sections can be used as a standalone layout if you don’t have enough poles to build the whole thing."

The Passing app was designed with a purpose to be used in practice and minimize the amount of time spent searching and pressing buttons. It is quick and easy to use. It can be used to track an entire team or individual during a specific drill. It does not save any data. Once you clear the scores, it starts all over. The Passing app keeps track of the total passing score and the number of attempts and calculates a passing average.\n\nThe intended scoring system for the Passing app is as follows:\n3 points for a pass the setter can set all 3 hitters in the front row \n2 points for a pass the setter can set only 2 hitters in the front row\n1 point for a pass the setter can only set 1 hitter in the front row\n0 points for a shanked pass (ace) or overpass"

      "label": "Did you know the scoreboard booth usually has a heater underneath its table? As the perfect mum or dad watching all your kids' Ice Hockey games, be the one setting the ambiance for the team AND being where the heater is! Talk to the scoreboard guru and offer to play music during the games. Nothing simpler, get the app, setup your playlist with the perfect start time for each song, and plug your phone to the rink's audio system. That's it! All the kids will vote for you to play at all the games now. You will see, the time at the rink will fly and you will be looking forward to the next game like never before and you will never freeze again. I wrote that app for my son, it changed the way I see rinks now. The team was even convincing home teams we were visiting to let me play music for the travel games!   \n\nThis is the perfect Dad's app for Ice Hockey Entertainment music management and playlist. Play Pump up Songs, Face Off, and Crowd Power Up to cheer up for your team. \n\n24 songs included in this version of the app. These songs by Audionautix and Kevin MacLeod are licensed under Creative Commons Attribution license. The 36 buttons of the app can be reprogrammed with any of your own songs from your iTunes library. (Horns, Organs, ...). \n\nThe latest addition is a full screen of your best team teams' Horns! It comes included! If I am missing your favorite team, contact me on instagram @HockeyDJApp.\n\n12 suggested links to iTunes titles which will pump up your kid's team.\n\nEvery button is customizable and can be set to point to the songs you own in your iTunes Local Library (No need for iTunes Cloud Subscription). You can purchase more screens if you want, up to 15 extra screens giving you a total of 216 customizable buttons.\n\nThe cool thing about the buttons is that you can set you own starting time per song, placing the play button at the best moment of the song to have a maximum effect on your DJ skills and for the please of the parents and players at the rink.\n\nThe \"Horn\" and \"1min Left in the game\" buttons are also customizable, and now you can recall the previous song after playing a goal announcement.\n\nVia InApp purchase, you can record your own voice for quick announcements and set on the \"1min Left Button\" (or on any other buttons).\n\nWith additional inApp purchases, you can play announcements for Penalties, by selecting : The voice, the player, the team, the time and type of penalty. Then you just need to press the ready and play button. With version 5.0 and above, you can also record player roster names. This will be played on demand when you announce penalties. You can even use it to record your own announcements and play them on the rink speakers as you would play any songs from the app.\n\nDisclaimer : Copyrighted songs (120 suggested) are not included in the Apps. This latest version will let you use your iTunes Cloud Music Subscription to select your songs. From the Settings screen, you can find a button to pre-load each screen with specific startup time for each song."

      "label": "The most advanced sports timer in the AppStore! \nFeatured by Apple in the TV-ad \"Strength\". \n\nSprintTimer is a unique sports timer and photo finish app that employs the same techniques as the fully automatic timing equipment (FAT) used at the Olympics. Start the timer and point the camera towards the finish line. The app creates an image where you can scroll to get the time for each competitor with a 0.01 s accuracy*. SprintTimer also includes a motion/human-activated Video Finish for longer races and a Start Sender for wirelessly controlling SprintTimer from another device.\n\nSprintTimer is used by coaches, teachers, and athletes all over the world for practice and competition in, for example, track & field, cycling, skiing, speed skating, car racing, rowing, kayaking, horses or greyhound racing. \n\nSprintTimer has several advantages over a manual stopwatch: \n- One person can time all participants\n- Higher accuracy*\n- Easier to determine the order\n- The image and the results can be saved\n- Can operate \"hands-free\" when started\n- The timer can be started manually, with a sound, or remotely from another device\n\n*See webpage: sprinttimer.app/accuracy\n\n——— Reviews and Comments ———\n\n\"Without a doubt the best App available on the market for sprinters and coaches who want accurate timing to see their development.\"\nspeedendurance.com\n\n\"AMAZING\"\nthepegeek.com\n\n\"Amazing app for physical education teachers or coaches!  I have used it for timing during our track and field, speed quickness & agility, fitness testing, & many more units.  It is very accurate and easy to use and gets the job done quickly!  A must-have!\"\nmertonphysed.weebly.com\n\n \"The app is very professionally set up and you can very easily capture your whole Track event.\"\nwww.melhamada.com\n\n\"Very useful app for measuring and/or verifying close finishes to track and field or road races.\"\nphysedreview.weebly.com\n\nSatisfied users from all over the world:\n- Brilliant.  A fantastic app for use in school athletics lessons\n- Amazing. This application is awesome and the results are really accurate.\n- What a brilliant app! Our £9k photo finish camera broke down and this app was a real lifesaver and worth way more than £1.50! Highly recommended.\n- This app is wonderful. We use it to time all our meets.\n- This is a great app and it is getting better from release to release\n- Nice, nice, nice! Using it for our youth track team. Love it! 5 stars!\n- Exactly what I needed - Fantastic app\n- Thank you so much for developing this amazing app just when we ran out of options.\n- Congratulations on developing a really clever and useful app.\n- Love what you did with the SprintTimer app.\n\n——— In-App Purchases and Subscriptions ———\n\nThe Start Sender and Results Manager features require the purchase of SprintTimer Pro, available as a subscription at $4.99 per year.

Prolonged writing to a flash drive shortness its life span.\n\n+ PRIVACY\nThe app does not in any way collect or send private data or require login. The app is self contained working on your device without any need to contact other services or use internet connection.\n\n\n\nWHAT CRITICS SAY (WITH VIDEO):\n\n[Professional physical education teacher Jarrod Robinson]\n\n“Over the years, I’ve spoken to thousands of PhysEd teachers about the app BaM Video Delay. It’s a complete game-changer that takes what used to be possible with expensive and complicated systems and makes it a reality for everyone”\n\nhttps://thepegeek.com/2016/03/raising-bar-bam-video-delay/\n\n\n[australiancurriculumtfel.edublogs.org]\n\n“The app has great potential to be used on a regular basis in physical education classes as a formative assessment tool.”\n\nhttp://australiancurriculumtfel.edublogs.org/2015/11/11/formative-assessment-using-bam-video-delay-app-in-pe/\n\n\n\nUSER REVIEWS:\n\nBy Kbone2000\n5/5 Great app!\nEvery coach needs this app. Immediate feedback for players and a great way for self analysis.\n\nBy James McDermott\n5/5 Great app!\nWorks for what I need, nice that you can have a delay rather than asking someone to record each time.\n\nBy awholelottatry\n5/5 A great technical training tool for sport and fitness\nThis is exactly what I was looking for! Needed it to perfect technique in Crossfit Olympic lifting. Every technical sport could use this valuable tool.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n\nEver wanted to learn a new move? \nBe it for professional dancing, gymnastics, golf, basketball, tennis, martial arts, breakdance, strike a pose or other use.\n\nA mirror is nice but it's hard to move and look the same time, sometimes even impossible when not facing forward. \n\nA video camera is OK but it is a hassle with all the start, stop, rewind, positioning and other.\n \nSo in the end you don't use either, give up on learning something new and move on with your life.\n\n\n\"Bust a Move Video Delay\" solves these problems.\nIt gives you an easy to use tool with quick feedback. You see what you just did, so you can correct it, try again, look again, correct ... and so on.\n\nAlso, after the initial setup, no interaction is needed so you can focus on training without any distractions.  \n\n\n\nSO WHAT DOES A “VIDEO DELAY” DO ?\n\nIt continuously shows you what just happened seconds ago. There is no alternating record or play phase, just continuous playback but with a given delay. This way you get fast and easy accessible video feedback. \n\nAlso no tapping, rewinding or other interactions are needed. Once set up it works hands free so you can focus on your moves.\n\nNow there are just two easy steps:\n1. BUST A MOVE\n(do what you want to learn)\n2. LOOK & LEARN\n(see what you just did and what's wrong)\n\nThis way you get instantaneous feedback so you can quickly learn on your mistakes and get better in no time. \n\n\n\nFEATURES:\n\n- \"hands free\" continuous playback but with a delay\n- up to Full HD at 30 fps and HD at 60 fps\n- universal app for both iPhone/iPod and iPad\n- delays from 1 second up to 6 minutes\n- uses device memory instead of its flash drive\n- up to 4 independent views so you can see yourself 4 times in a row\n- slow motion and pause to analyse the video\n- export as video\n- AirPlay and HDMI TV cable support\n- auto hiding interface controls\n- \"Live View\" for easy positioning of the camera and setup\n- front to rear camera switch\n- horizontal flip\n- x2 Zoom with panning\n- exposure and focus setting\n- and a manual, just in case"

The app gives you duration, distance, speed and altitude as well as your exact position and track lines on a map while tracking.\n\nThe web site stores your tracks in an archive under your account that enables you to log in and view and edit your tracks. Using the app, you can be as anonymous as you like since you track under an Alias, and you can even set the tracks to be private (not listed or searchable on locatoweb.com). \n\nThe app only records your position when a track has been set up and started and lasts until you stop it. It is frequently used to track bicycle rides, road trips, hiking trips and other outdoor adventures where you want to show your friends and family where you are, or to simply track your adventures for your own pleasure.\n\nThere is also a safety aspect of using LocaToWeb. If you have the track running and something happens, your wife, husband and friends can see the exact location of where you are. Maybe you are riding your bike and falls off hitting your head, or you just want to be safe when walking home alone at night. \n\nKey features:\n\n- Share your position to web in real time\n- Monitor duration, distance, speed and altitude\n- See your exact position and track line on a map\n- Capture and upload photos while tracking\n- Set up race groups that tracks several participants\n- Choose your units system (metric/imperial)\n- Possible to keep the screen alive while tracking\n- Resume a track that has been stopped\n- View and edit your archived tracks anytime on the web site\n- Just install and track, no registering is required\n\nNote that continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

      "label": "In the middle of the rush for applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning to training apps, Happy Fingers wants you, rather than the machine, to be the one that actually learns something.\n\nHappy Fingers has the following goals:\n• Answering all of your questions related to finger training for climbing;\n• Carefully guiding you in the process of choosing some training method or grip type;\n• Describing how to warm up; how to hang or how to perform each program;\n• Teaching you how to control the load to ensure the desired effects;\n• Offering alternatives to keep from stalling;\n• Preventing injuries, overtraining and excessive fatigue in your forearms;\n• Describing different training methods and the optimal exercise for each circumstance;\n• Providing a range of training programs for each method, level and athletic goal to choose from.\n\nI’m Eva López; climbing is my passion and the topic of my doctoral thesis on Finger Endurance and Strength Training in Climbing. I developed Happy Fingers with the aim of making you the main character in your growth process, looking at the reasons behind any hitch you find while training, offering strategies to keep your motivation or progressing in the long run. Of course, your personal situation, objectives and needs will always be part of the equation.\n\nAll of the above is based on the most up to date research and what I’ve learned along my 20+ years of observation, analysis and experimentation. I have adapted all that knowledge to the individual characteristics of every person I’ve trained, including myself, to refine and complete the process. Linking Science & Experience, relating Theory & Practice, Evidence-based Training, all describe this educational resource that will help you get the most out of your workouts and your climbs.\n\nI want to make clear that the Happy Fingers app does not automatically churn out training programs from some initial evaluation. It's full of information and advice, but it will never command you to blindly follow some path. Individualization is a staple of training, the Holy Grail. You decide. You’re on the driver’s seat.\n\nCONTENTS:\n1. Before You Hang.\n11. Are dead hangs for me?\n1.2. Terminology.\n1.3. What gear do I need\n\n2. The Basic Dilemmas\n2.1.

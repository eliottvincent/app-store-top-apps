      "label": "Avy savvy backcountry skiers and riders know that three things count when it comes to the terrain’s influence on avalanches: the slope, the elevation, and the (compass) aspect. And the Avalanche Inclinometer delivers all three. Sure, you can find plenty of inclinometer apps (also known as clinometers) that are designed for carpenters, but Steve's Avalanche Inclinometer is meant for people who spend time in avalanche terrain. \n\nThis app shows the slope, elevation, and aspect in BIG FONTS which are perfect for tired eyes in stormy (or bright-and-too-sunny) weather. And it doesn’t display a gaggle of tiny buttons and widgets to decipher when you should be skiing.\n\nYou can sight across a slope by holding your phone parallel to the slope, or you can sight up or down a slope by sighting along the long-edge of your phone like a gunsight. (Through-the-camera sighting is nifty when the light is just right, but it often isn't.)\n\nWhen you have your phone aligned with the slope, a single tap on the screen will lock the data so you can read it. The Avalanche Inclinometer will even speak to you as you’re measuring the steepness so you won’t need to look at the screen. And the BIG inclinometer dial changes colors based on the slope which provides instant feedback on how the steepness of the terrain is contributing to the likelihood of an avalanche.\n\nAfter measuring the slope, you can tap a single button to share your current GPS location, the slope in degrees, and the elevation. The email includes kml and gpx waypoint files, and a link that will let you quickly see the location in any browser. You can enter the email address one time and the Avalanche Inclinometer will remember it for next time. Less typing; more skiing.\n\nThe Avalanche Inclinometer isn’t free, but apps don’t grow on trees. To buy this app you’ll spend less than buying a beer at a ski resort—think of it as buying Steve a beer!\n\nIn addition to the Avalanche Inclinometer, it is important that you take an avy class, pay attention to the avalanche red flags, use good route finding techniques, and practice your avalanche rescue skills frequently"

      "label": "Used by beginners through Major Championship winners on the PGA Tour, and validated by an Independent Scientific Study by the Departments of Physics and Biomechanics at Yale University.\n\nThe Tour Tempo Total Game allows you to learn how to correctly integrate the Tempo of the Tour Pros into your golf swing. Over 100,000 golfers worldwide, including Major Championship winners on the PGA Tour, have improved their games by using Tour Tempo.  \n\n\"In all the reviews I've written for MyGolfSpy (a number now pushing up on 100), I'd only given one perfect score. Now Tour Tempo can be added to that most-elite company. Tour Tempo is scientifically proven, it's easy to use, and it will help you in every facet of the game.\" \n— GolfSpy Matt: http://www.mygolfspy.com/tour-tempo-review\n\n\"It will be the best thing that you will ever do for your game.\" \n— Pat Dempsey, 2011 RE/MAX World Long Drive Grand Champion 55+\n\n\"You will get better right away! When you synch your swing to that of the Tour Pros with Tour Tempo, you’ll get better right now!\" \n— Dan Rooney, Folds of Honor\n\n\"The Unified Theory of Tempo\" \n— Golf Digest \n\n\"No one has ever come up with a way to teach Tempo until now.\"\n— Travel + Leisure Golf \n\nBased on the international best selling golf book, Tour Tempo. The book outlines and explains the discovery of a specific mathematical ratio regarding the elapsed time of the backswing and the elapsed time of the downswing of the Tour Pros. The Tour Tempo System is simple and easy to learn. All you do is react to three scientifically spaced musical notes. These musical notes alert you to start your takeaway, start your downswing, and then the third note lines you up with impact. It’s just that easy - you literally download the app, turn it on, grab a club and start swinging to the Tempo of the Tour Pros.\n\nLONG GAME\nThe Long Game Tones will teach you how to swing with the tempo ratio exhibited by the Tour Pros. We measured the time of their backswings and downswings by counting how many frames of video each part took. The magic ratio on full swings turned out to be three parts backswing to one part downswing. Tones are provided for each of the following frame ratios of Tour Tempo - 18/6, 21/7, 24/8 & 27/9. The Tour Tempo Tones have a clear purpose. They establish the intrinsic tempo of the golf swing in your subconscious mind. Once this is accomplished, you will not have to think about tempo while playing. This is what the Tour Pros have already done. You are about to acquire that same ability.\n\nSHORT GAME\nThe Total Game App also contains the Short Game Tones of 14/7, 16/8, 18/9 & 20/10. After the publication of Tour Tempo, John Novosel studied the short game swings of the top touring pros, and discovered that virtually all of them employ a 2 to 1 swing ratio on or around the greens - a different Tempo than the 3 to 1 ratio of the Long Game. This is another reason why the game of golf is so hard to master.      \n\nTEMPO TRACKS\nThe Tempo Tracks are an easy way to integrate Tour Tempo into your daily routine. One of the best ways to use the Tracks is to listen to them while driving to the course before a round of golf. The more you listen to them, the more the Tour Tempo rhythm will be ingrained into your Golf Swing. \n\nFOCUS TRACKS\nThe Focus Tracks are revolutionary relaxation songs that contain the Tones of Tour Tempo. Each Track has a Part II that has binaural tones embedded in the music to get your brain into an optimum state for concentration. This optimum state is more commonly known to athletes as “Being in the Zone.”\n\nVIDEOS\nThe videos give a complete explanation of the Tones and how to use them to immediately and dramatically improve your Total Game.  \n\nDISCOUNT\nThe app is your first step towards a more powerful, consistent golf game, and that is why we are giving you a discount from our Tour Tempo Shop. On the 'Info' screen you will find a one-time discount code good for $10 off on a future purchase at TourTempo.com and TourTempo.eu."

      "label": "THE BEST VIDEO REPLAY APP!\n- Number 1 in the Sports iPad Category!!!\n- Trusted by the US major league baseball and basketball teams.\n\nAre you frustrated by making the same mistakes and wasting time on your practice? Video Delay Instant Replay is a fantastic way for athletes to receive instant feedback on their performance. Analyze your form, build good muscle memory, and get faster results. \n\nMake every practice satisfying and effective!\n\nThere are three main features: the DELAY, the SLO-MO, and the REPLAY.\n\nThe DELAY Mode continuously shows the delayed video during practice. After setting the buffer time, there's no need to record and replay manually. The video feedback will be on until you reset the buffer or hit the exit button.\n\nThe SLO-MO Mode captures a short video and instantly replays it in slow motion. It works best for quick activities, like punch or shoot. To adjust the speed rate, use the slider. The recording will get you short slow-motion videos of every repetition. \n\nThe REPLAY View* allows frame-by-frame analysis of athlete moves, including measuring the angles. You can also export a short part of the replay video using AB selection.\n* It works only with Delay mode and a buffer time longer than 1 second.\n\nImprove your skills and get faster results:\n1. Set the Buffer time.\n2. Do your action.\n3. Watch the video feedback.\n4. Immediately correct your posture and repeat!\n\nCoaches and teachers! \nUse the app with an external screen for even better feedback during practice! Watch the Replay video with your team, analyze your players' performance, and correct errors. Add lines on the screen to check out the angles. Trim the video, so it only shows what you want your students to concentrate on. Record only necessary parts of the practice. Instant Feedback also helps to settle disputes between players.\n\nBasketball, baseball, and football players! \nPractice by repetition -  improve your shooting form by copying your favorite players' moves. Make out the best of your hitting drill. Take a quick look at the footage, correct your posture, and return to the action. No need to rewind or touch the device; the video will play instantly. You will be able to see if your pose is good and if your fake moves are effective. \n\nGolf and tennis players! \nUse a motion-detection grid and correct your swing or backhand instantly! Perform proper movements and maintain good posture while exercising. Build better muscle memory and improve your game!\n\nTraining martial arts, archery, or shooting? \nStudy your form with delayed video feedback. Set a short delay time and analyze your moves in slow motion. See what to correct in your kicks or punches.\n\nPilates or yoga fan? \nCheck out poses you won’t see in the mirror, like dog or pigeon. Make sure you are true to form and protect yourself from injury.\n\nActors and performers!\nReplay yourself performing and improve your acting skills. Check out your gestures in slow-motion and make them the best!\n\nFor information on how to use the VDIR, please check out the User Guide in the app!"

      "label": "Pickleball Score Keeper is the first Pickleball app designed for Apple Watch. It turns your Apple Watch into a simple and easy-to-use score tracking device. All matches are stored on your iPhone and key statistics give you insights on how to improve your game.\n- Keep track of all your matches (with or without an Apple Watch)\n- Singles and doubles match modes\n- Identify teammates and opponents\n- Track your unforced errors\n- Service statistics\n- Player database to keep notes on opponent strengths and weaknesses\n- Follow live matches point by point\n- Integrates with Health app (steps taken, running distance, maximum heart rate, calories burned) to help you gain insight into your Pickleball workouts as well as to monitor how hard your opponents make you work\n\n---\nHow to use the Watch app:\nIt is so simple. Just start the app from your Apple Watch.\n- Select game setup (i.e.: Doubles, Game to 11, Win by 2)\n- Swipe towards you when you win a rally.\n- Swipe away from you when you lose a rally.\n- Swipe right to record an unforced error.\n- Swipe left to undo.\n- Press down on the watch face to end session or restart a game.\n\nTIP! Swipe from the middle of the watch, not the edge.\n\nScores are spoken aloud and gentle vibrations allow you to continue play without looking at your watch.\nPlayer positions and current server are shown on the watch face in case you lose track.\n\nIMPORTANT:\nThe watch is by default set to wake on wrist raise. If Pickleball Score Keeper does not open on Wrist Raise gesture during a match, please do the following from the watch home screen:\n1. Tap Settings > tap General > tap Wake Screen \n2. Make sure that \"Wake Screen on Wrist Raise\" is turned on. \n3. Scroll down to \"Resume to: Previous Activity\" and checkmark.\n\nPlease don’t be shy to use the Feedback button on the Pickleball Score Keeper iPhone app to contact us with ideas and suggestion.  We welcome your feedback."

By freedivers, for freedivers, our freedive apnea trainer helps you with static apnea tables and lung capacity training so you can effectively increase the time when diving underwater.\r\nSee why STAmina Apnea Trainer is one of the best apnea apps to improve the breath-holding time for freediving, scuba diving and spearfishing, as well as surfing, running, and other water sports with 6 different apnea tables types.\n\n\r\n■ FREEDIVING & SPEARFISHING APNEA TRAINER FEATURES:\n\n\r\n◉ 6 APNEA TABLE OPTIONS \r\nSTAmina Apnea Trainer can create / generate custom apnea (exercises that are automatically created based on the maximum breath-hold and match the user’s level) or let you select from the following customizable table types:\r\n\r\n- O2 deprivation table – accustoms a body to lower oxygen levels. This is achieved by increasing the amount of time that you hold your breath on each attempt, while the resting time is fixed.\r\n\r\n- CO2 Tolerance table – helps a body to adapt to high carbon dioxide levels. This is achieved by decreasing the length of resting time between fixed breath-hold periods.\r\n\r\n- Wonka table – a variation of CO2 tables. Apnea timer starts after the first contraction, the rest time takes one breath.\r\n\r\n- Mix table – tables where apnea time increases and rest time decreases with each round.\r\n\r\n- Custom table – allows mixing of different approaches to create a custom training, thus generating the most effective training program.\r\n\r\n- Pranayama – a breathing technique to decrease stress in the body and relax the nervous system.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ APPLE HEALTH SYNCRONIZATION \n\n\r\n\r\n◉ PERSONALIZED TRAINING WITH VARYING DIFFICULTY\r\nWhen you start working with the application, you set your personal record in breath holding. Based on this data, the app will offer a personalized training program with exercises of 3 difficulty levels to choose from: easy, normal, and hard.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ PERSONALIZED EXERCISE SETTINGS \r\nEach exercise can be edited by setting your own number of repetitions, breath hold time, rest time, etc.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ TRAINING REMINDERS \r\nGet the notification to start your apnea training. Set a reminder in the apnea diver app for the day and the time & get a notification to do a breath holding training session.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ PERSONAL STATISTICS AND DETAILED TRAINING HISTORY\r\nAll your workouts and exercises are recorded in the freedive trainer app to track the detailed progress of each training.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ VOICE GUIDANCE\r\nTraining may be accompanied by voice guidance with male/female voices recorded by professional voice actors. STAmina supports English, French, Russian voice guidance.\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n◉ HEART RATE AND OXYGEN SATURATION TRACKING\r\nTrack your heart rate while doing breath holding exercises (a compatible HR monitor or pulse-oximeter is required) \n\n\r\n\r\n◉ CONTRACTIONS TRACKING \r\nUse our freedive trainer to track unlimited contractions, analyse captured data after exercises\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ CLOUD SYNC / BACKUP\r\nAccess your data on multiple devices and easily restore it in case you switch devices/phones.\n\n\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\nStamina Apnea Trainer allows training breath hold effectively for anyone who cares about all kinds of diving including:\r\n> beginner or professional freedivers;\r\nspearfishers;\r\n> scuba divers to learn how to dive longer on one tank;\r\n> surfers in case of unexpected breath hold;\r\n> underwater sports athletes such as underwater rugby, hockey, etc.\r\n> runners who want to train breath holding & high tolerance to CO2 while running\r\n\r\n_______\r\nInfo https://getstamina.app/\r\nContact https://www.facebook.com/staminamobile/\r\nSupport hello@squarecrowdapps.com"

Play Pump up Songs, Face Off, and Crowd Power Up to cheer up for your team. \n\n24 songs included in this version of the app. These songs by Audionautix and Kevin MacLeod are licensed under Creative Commons Attribution license. The 36 buttons of the app can be reprogrammed with any of your own songs from your iTunes library. (Horns, Organs, ...). \n\nThe latest addition is a full screen of your best team teams' Horns! It comes included! If I am missing your favorite team, contact me on instagram @HockeyDJApp.\n\n12 suggested links to iTunes titles which will pump up your kid's team.\n\nEvery button is customizable and can be set to point to the songs you own in your iTunes Local Library (No need for iTunes Cloud Subscription). You can purchase more screens if you want, up to 15 extra screens giving you a total of 216 customizable buttons.\n\nThe cool thing about the buttons is that you can set you own starting time per song, placing the play button at the best moment of the song to have a maximum effect on your DJ skills and for the please of the parents and players at the rink.\n\nThe \"Horn\" and \"1min Left in the game\" buttons are also customizable, and now you can recall the previous song after playing a goal announcement.\n\nVia InApp purchase, you can record your own voice for quick announcements and set on the \"1min Left Button\" (or on any other buttons).\n\nWith additional inApp purchases, you can play announcements for Penalties, by selecting : The voice, the player, the team, the time and type of penalty. Then you just need to press the ready and play button. With version 5.0 and above, you can also record player roster names. This will be played on demand when you announce penalties. You can even use it to record your own announcements and play them on the rink speakers as you would play any songs from the app.\n\nDisclaimer : Copyrighted songs (120 suggested) are not included in the Apps. This latest version will let you use your iTunes Cloud Music Subscription to select your songs. From the Settings screen, you can find a button to pre-load each screen with specific startup time for each song."

Prolonged writing to a flash drive shortness its life span.\n\n+ PRIVACY\nThe app does not in any way collect or send private data or require login. The app is self contained working on your device without any need to contact other services or use internet connection.\n\n\n\nWHAT CRITICS SAY (WITH VIDEO):\n\n[Professional physical education teacher Jarrod Robinson]\n\n“Over the years, I’ve spoken to thousands of PhysEd teachers about the app BaM Video Delay. It’s a complete game-changer that takes what used to be possible with expensive and complicated systems and makes it a reality for everyone”\n\nhttps://thepegeek.com/2016/03/raising-bar-bam-video-delay/\n\n\n[australiancurriculumtfel.edublogs.org]\n\n“The app has great potential to be used on a regular basis in physical education classes as a formative assessment tool.”\n\nhttp://australiancurriculumtfel.edublogs.org/2015/11/11/formative-assessment-using-bam-video-delay-app-in-pe/\n\n\n\nUSER REVIEWS:\n\nBy Kbone2000\n5/5 Great app!\nEvery coach needs this app. Immediate feedback for players and a great way for self analysis.\n\nBy James McDermott\n5/5 Great app!\nWorks for what I need, nice that you can have a delay rather than asking someone to record each time.\n\nBy awholelottatry\n5/5 A great technical training tool for sport and fitness\nThis is exactly what I was looking for! Needed it to perfect technique in Crossfit Olympic lifting. Every technical sport could use this valuable tool.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n\nEver wanted to learn a new move? \nBe it for professional dancing, gymnastics, golf, basketball, tennis, martial arts, breakdance, strike a pose or other use.\n\nA mirror is nice but it's hard to move and look the same time, sometimes even impossible when not facing forward. \n\nA video camera is OK but it is a hassle with all the start, stop, rewind, positioning and other.\n \nSo in the end you don't use either, give up on learning something new and move on with your life.\n\n\n\"Bust a Move Video Delay\" solves these problems.\nIt gives you an easy to use tool with quick feedback. You see what you just did, so you can correct it, try again, look again, correct ... and so on.\n\nAlso, after the initial setup, no interaction is needed so you can focus on training without any distractions.  \n\n\n\nSO WHAT DOES A “VIDEO DELAY” DO ?\n\nIt continuously shows you what just happened seconds ago. There is no alternating record or play phase, just continuous playback but with a given delay. This way you get fast and easy accessible video feedback. \n\nAlso no tapping, rewinding or other interactions are needed. Once set up it works hands free so you can focus on your moves.\n\nNow there are just two easy steps:\n1. BUST A MOVE\n(do what you want to learn)\n2. LOOK & LEARN\n(see what you just did and what's wrong)\n\nThis way you get instantaneous feedback so you can quickly learn on your mistakes and get better in no time. \n\n\n\nFEATURES:\n\n- \"hands free\" continuous playback but with a delay\n- up to Full HD at 30 fps and HD at 60 fps\n- universal app for both iPhone/iPod and iPad\n- delays from 1 second up to 6 minutes\n- uses device memory instead of its flash drive\n- up to 4 independent views so you can see yourself 4 times in a row\n- slow motion and pause to analyse the video\n- export as video\n- AirPlay and HDMI TV cable support\n- auto hiding interface controls\n- \"Live View\" for easy positioning of the camera and setup\n- front to rear camera switch\n- horizontal flip\n- x2 Zoom with panning\n- exposure and focus setting\n- and a manual, just in case"

      "label": "The TRACT Optics Impact Ballistics mobile application takes the guesswork out of long-range shooting and provides data to help the most experienced shooter as well as the beginner or novice. This mobile application is one of the most comprehensive databases of information available today. With virtually every modern ammunition manufacturer’s information listed shooters can match any TRACT rifle scope reticle to their exact cartridge. Simply select your scope, then your ammo/bullet the program will calculate the bullet drop information as it pertains to your reticle automatically. If you cannot find your particular round of ammunition in the program, simply add the Ballistic Coefficient (B.C.) and Muzzle Velocity to the program and you will be good to go. With the ability to import current weather conditions the Impact program will provide up to date Bullet Drop Compensation to help you make accurate shots in the field or at the range. While the mobile application is designed to provide ballistic date without an internet connection, when the user has an internet connection, they are able to access our complete library of videos, articles, and blogs. Simply navigate to the Learn section of the app and you can access the Getting Started section for Rifle Scopes, Binoculars and Spotting Scopes as well as Pro Shooting Tips with videos detailing How To videos showing how to maximize the performance of your optic. You can even shop our complete line of Optics and Accessories right from the App. This app will be continually updated with new ammunition information, new product releases and videos. Selectable options include Meters or Yards, Drag Table, Spin Drift, Sight Height, Printable Dope and BDC cards, the ability to compare loads, atmospheric conditions (manual entry or automatic import), wind direction, sight setting/zero calculator and much more. The program is capable of providing ballistic data out to 2,500 yards. The BDC card allows the shooter to print out a “cheat sheet” that can show the bullet drop at each magnification (for Second Focal Plane scopes) The Dope card provides velocity, energy, path, drop, wind drift, time of flight, # of click value and MOA or MRAD info in 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 yard increments. Weather/Atmospheric conditions can be automatically imported thanks to our direct link to World Weather Online, or you can manually enter the Temperature, Altitude, Barometric Pressure and Humidity through the Conditions section. The conditions section also allows the user to enter Bullet Wind Drift information such as wind speed and direction and provide data in inches, MOA or MRAD. The sight settings section is a great resource for shooters who would like to zero their rifle at a further distance then they are able to shoot. For example, if a user only has access to a 100-yard range but would like his rifle to be zeroed at 200 yards, the Sight Setting section will show the user where his bullet needs to impact on a 100-yard target to be zeroed at 200 yards. Our goal for this app is that it provides you with a comprehensive resource for everything and anything related to TRACT Optics…Where you Belong."

      "label": "Mobile Golf Tempo Training App allows any golfer to mimic the swing of the Pros, improving distance and accuracy, potentially making the need for bunkers obsolete!\n\nMobile Golf Tempo is the best way to master long and short game with a smooth swing rhythm as well as putting distance control.  \n\nProfessional golfers regularly work their tempo so why not you?\n\nTeaching pros agree that consistent tempo is an important aspect of the golf swing. A very slow tempo is something golfers of all levels should avoid. This app allows golfers to establish the tempo of the tour pros and a fluid rhythm in order to add length to their shots, consistency across their game and distance control.\n\nThe “Swing ratio” is the time it takes to complete the backswing as compared to the downswing. A swing ratio of 3:1 means the backswing is three times as long as the downswing. This swing ratio can vary across club selection or shot type. For example, many touring pros use a swing ratio of 3:1 for their driver with a ratio of 2.1:1 when making their putts. \n\nBy simply reacting to visual, audial or vibrational signals delivered through your iPhone, you can begin your backswing, start your downswing, and make impact with the golf ball at precisely the correct tempo and timing. It’s just that simple!\n\nThere is even and optional additional tone for golfers who utilize a swing trigger (any kind of move that takes place just before golfers start their swing) in their game. \nVisit our blog at http://www.mobile-golf-tempo.com/blog-in-english/ to learn to control distance in short game using Mobile Golf Tempo.\n\nFor the demanding golfers, Mobile Golf Tempo allows them to change all parameters of the tempo.\n\nFeatures:\n* Simple and advanced mode\n* Possibility to create a WAV file containing audio sequences from your tempo to be played by your iPod mini for example\n* The only tempo app fully configurable that allows slow tempo (useful for senior players) as well as extremely fast tempo like the faster pros on tour, and all in between \n* One of the only tempo apps that allows you to break rules and experiment all you want: swing ratio can be changed from 1.00:1 to 4.25:1 \n* Opportunity to have different tempos for each club (including the putter)\n* Tempo is expressed in different ways, one of which is textual (too slow, slow, relax, animated, lively, fast, very fast, explosive and too fast)\n* 7 preset tempos corresponding to the majority of touring pros\n* Ability to adjust the human reaction time to the sound. So, you only have to react to the tones\n* Ability to take into account the time of a possible swing trigger (ritual)\n* Animation of the swing (driver, iron, full swing wedge, ¾ swing wedge, ½ swing wedge, ¼ swing wedges and putter), right-handed and left-handed. The movement of the golfer reflects your settings (e.g. the swing trigger and the human reaction time to sound).\n* Possibility to select a random time between the sound sequences\n* Metronome\n* Vibrate mode\n* Compatible with the Suunto G6 watch\n* Languages: French, English and Spanish\n* Train your tempo memory\n* Learning mode\n* Offline documentation with technical advices\n\nIf you're not getting sound from Mobile Golf Tempo App,  please check the \"Mute\" side switch located near the volume button. \n\nThe reason why some apps (like Music) played sound and others didn't is because individual iOS apps can decide whether their audio should play regardless of the mute switch state. \n\nMany golf clubs prohibit the sounds of phones, and that's why the sound of Mobile Golf Tempo app does not play when you use side switch to mute the phone.  This is a normal and standard feature, so please don't write negative comments for something that's absolutely logical!"

Wouldn’t it be great to be able to dive deeply with one big breath and take incredible pictures for your friends at home? The Apnea Trainer makes it possible! By using it to train three times a week, you can quickly double your underwater time.\n\nThis is the same training principle used by apnea divers. It’s based on a yoga technique which strengthens the diaphragm muscles allowing you to fill your lungs with more oxygen and releasing more carbon dioxide while exhaling. The system is relatively simple and depends on finding the right time intervals which are provided by the program, thus letting you relax and concentrate on your breathing. This will guarantee maximum training success.\nThe program will also come in handy just before the actual dive since a pranayama mode is already included. The Apnea Trainer will help you keep your whole body calm and give you the perfect preparation for those amazing, long-lasting dives. \n\n\nFeatures:\n+ Training to improve free diving time\n\n+ Pranayama mode to calm your body before diving or snorkeling\n\n+ Custom time settings for pro divers\n\n+ Optical and Audio instructions\n\n+ Easy to use interface\n\nUpdated user interface with the help of Bjoern Maser by www.minimalist.ch."

      "label": "An extensive overhaul of the app is now complete, making a 4.5/5 star app even better! This upgrade is packed with lots of new features and a new interface that supports both portrait and landscape modes.\n\nWith iTouchStats Basketball, you are in control over how much data you want to track.  The most popular method is to track individual player stats for one team while tracking just the opponent's team stats, as shown in the 1st screen shot.  Or you can track individual player stats for both teams, as shown in the 2nd screen shot.  Which stats you track for each team is up to you.   Even the use of the game clock and shot location tracking are optional.  \n\nA unique feature of iTouchStats Basketball is the quick stat icons that appear next to a player's photo or jersey.  These icons coordinate with the stat button colors, giving you an easy way to see a player's key stats without needing to leave the main scoring screen.  Icons include: Points (Green), Fouls (Red), Turnovers (Orange), Assists (Yellow), Steals (Gray), and Blocks (Brown).  By double-tapping on a player, you can get even more stat details including shot charts and shooting percentages.\n \nNEW ▸▸  One of the coolest features added in v4.0 is the team bench that appears at the bottom of the score keeping screen.  The bench greatly improves player subbing and also gives you easy access to viewing the stats of the players not in the game.  You can even register a stat to a player on the bench if a sub-in was missed.\n \nNEW ▸▸  User Definable Rating System (This system has the ability to give individual values to each stat, allowing a quick easy way for a coach or parent to see how a player performed in a game based on these values.)\n\nNEW ▸▸  User Definable Stat Button (This definable stat button can also be turned off in the game reports.)\n\nNEW ▸▸  Team quick stats are displayed in the scoreboard. \n \nNEW ▸▸  iCloud Data Backups\n\nNEW ▸▸  Half Timeouts have been added as an option.\n\nNEW ▸▸  Running Clock is an added Rules option.\n\nIMPROVED ▸▸  Game and season PDF reports.  Not only has the look improved, but you can now choose which stats are displayed on PDF reports.  For example, if the game clock is not used and deflections are not tracked, then you can turn these fields off in PDF reports.\n\nIMPROVED ▸▸  Stat viewing options.  You can now view a team or player(s) stats by periods.  For example, you could use this to compare how your starters did in the 2nd half vs. the 1st half.  You could even do this over multiple games!\n    \nIMPROVED ▸▸  Season, Team, and Player management.  For users who track multiple seasons, you will now only see data relating to your \"Default\" season, but changing between seasons can be done easily. \n\n▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸\nDETAILED STAT LIST\n▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸\n▸ 2-Point, 3-Point, Free Throws, Field Goals (Made, Attempts, and % for each) \n ▸ Rebounds (Offensive, Defensive, Dead Ball)  \n▸ Assists  \n▸ Blocks  \n▸ Steals  \n▸ Turnovers (optional Forced or Unforced: Out of Bounds, Lost Ball, Ball Handling, Bad Pass, Back Court, 3 Sec, 5 Sec, 10 Sec, Shot Clock, Other)  \n▸ Fouls (optional: Offensive, Defensive, Flagrant, Team Technical, Player Technical)  \n▸ Charges Taken \n▸ Deflections   \n▸ Forced Jump Balls \n ▸ Efficiency (Stat formula taken from http://www.nba.com/statistics/efficiency.html) \n▸ Rating (User Definable Rating System)\n ▸ Minutes Played  \n▸ Games (Started, Played)  \n▸ User Definable Stat Button\n\n▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸\nView app videos and download sample PDF reports at iTouchStats.com\n▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸"

      "label": "***Validation published on the Journal of Applied Biomechanics***\n\nWe know you love running, but do you know how do you run?\n\nDesigned by sport scientists & coaches of elite runners, Runmatic is the first scientifically designed app that analyzes your running and sprinting technique to help you to improve your performance and prevent injuries.\n\nRunmatic takes advance of the slowmotion recording capabilities of your iOS devices to accurately analyze your running and sprinting technique. Using scientifically validation equations, Runmatic calculates the contact-flight times, force, efficiency, frequency and even the asymmetry of your legs in a simple, accurate way. Runmatic can also analyze your stride informing about relevant variables such as pronation, pelvic drop or strike pattern, which could help you prevent injuries. \n\nRunmatic is an extraordinary tool for sprint analysis as well. It can measure total time, splits and contact/flight times with a precision comparable to professional timing gates. Moreover, it can create Kinograms (following the methodology by ALTIS) to analyze the quality of motion of each phase of the sprint. You can even calculate the most relevant angles of your body!\n\n\n****Pr. Jean-Benoit Morin, PhD, Expert in running biomechanics: \"This is a very useful app to evaluate and monitor the mechanics of the runners' strides. It's accurate, it's scientifically validated and it uses equations derived from our research (Morin et al., 2005). The tools often used to perform this kind of analyses are much more expensive and generally less practical for the general population. Runmatic solves this problem and allows runners to analyze and monitor their running mechanics in an easy way\"\n\n****Arturo Casado, Olympic runner, 2010 European 1500m Champion: \"Runmatic is very helpful for my training. It let me better understand how do I run, which is critical to improve my running economy and, therefore, my performance. Is like a lab in my pocket!\"\n\nRunmatic has a lot of great features that will help you monitor your running and sprinting performance in a very simple, yet powerful way:\n\n-Calculate contact time, flight time, frequency, max force, displacement of the center of mass and leg stiffness with scientific accuracy\n-Analyze your stride to calculate your pelvic drop, pronation and strike patter, which could help you prevent injuries.\n-Measure total time, splits and contact and flight times of your sprints.\n-Analyze the quality of the sprint by creating Kinograms (ALTIS methodology).\n-Multi-user: create as many users as you want\n-iCloud sync (iOS13 only)\n-Progress analysis: save as many runs as you want and see your progress through time to check if you have improved or worsened your performance. You can even see the percent of change from one test to another!\n-Data export: export your whole database to a csv file and play with your data in Excel!\n-Universal app: purchase once and install it on your iPhone, iPad or Mac (10.15+)\n\n\nRunmatic, analyze your running/sprinting mechanics and improve your performance!"

You want to add the pressure you have on the course to stay steady and not over swing.  There is a fundamental idea of desirable difficulty, coined by the cognitive psychologist Robert Bjork in 1994, which argues that introducing a certain degree of challenge to the learning process boosts long-term retention.\n\nEasily adjust for ALL types of swings and ALL levels of ability.\n\nThe four head-movement boundaries (TOP, BOTTOM, LEFT, RIGHT) can be easily customized through individual settings for each.   Depending on your skill level, what club you are hitting, and your swing tendencies, set the boundaries accordingly.\n\n\nSIMPLE Design\n-\tNo props or gadgets involved!\n-\tJust set your phone down in front of you and swing\n-\tEasy adjustments in Settings\n\nSMART Interface\n-\tUses facial recognition to start/stop\n-\tSwing naturally \n-\tChoose visual and/or audio prompts\n\nINSTANT Feedback\n-\tProven adverse-conditioning approach\n-\tAdjust for different abilities and clubs\n-\tReview swings on Camera Roll\n\n\nHere is what some of the Steady Head users are saying …\n\nBryce Hayden (Newport Beach, CA), 5 hcp  -  “What I love is that I don’t need anything but my phone to train the most important thing in my swing …”\n\nChris Ward (Denver, CO), 9 hcp - “The app tells me in real-time when my head moves too much, not after the fact.”\n\nCharlie Long (Tuscon, AZ) instructor - “This is a groundbreaking app … a must have for every golfer”\n\nArt Vandelay (New York, NY), 18 hcp- “I really like how all the swings are saved to the Cameral Roll, and I can analyze them to see exactly how and when my head is moving out of position.”\n\nDaniel Strong (Orlanda, FL), 1 hcp - “What makes this training method different is there is nothing unnatural, so it translates to real play very effectively”\n\nChip Brakeville (San Clemente, CA), 14 hcp - “When I make a good swing, I get no feedback … which is what I want, just like the real thing on the course.”\n\nTori Greene (Minneapolis, MN), 10 hcp - “I can train anywhere …  indoors or outdoors … with or without a club … hitting a ball or not.”\n\nBilly McCoy (Dallas, TX), scratch - “It’s really cool how you can set the head-movement boundaries however you want, to condition myself to eliminate my bad tendencies.”\n\nMike Morretti  (Kansas City, MO), 13 hcp – “Now you don’t need someone or something to hold your head while you swing!”\n\nBrandel Tutor (Clearwater, FL), 2 hcp - “This is what you call an elegantly simple app.”\n\nFrank Knight (Phoenix, AZ), 12 hcp -  “You can start with an easy setting, then gradually tighten the boundaries as you train yourself”\n\nRalph Moore (Valencia, CA), +2 hcp – “This app have been key in validating that my new swing moves are not causing my head to move out of position”\n\nSean Lyle (Baltimore, MD), teaching pro:  “This is the holy grail of swing trainers …. Instead of telling my students AFTERWARDS that they moved their head, now they know when it happens DURING their swing”\n\nLarry Learned (Jacksonville, FL), club pro:  “Now I don’t have to say ‘keep your head down’ to my students.

      "label": "WHY HUNTER TRACKER?\nThere are a few hunting apps on the market these days, and even less tracking apps. Most are complicated and time consuming. And what happens AFTER you bag that big buck? With these issues in mind, we created Hunter Tracker, the world's easiest hunting and tracking app! It was created for hunters by hunters. The same problems that you’ve faced in the wild, we've faced as well.\n\n* New Colors!\n* New Menus!\n* New Deer Activity Indicators!\n* No Irritating Pop-Up Ads!\n* No Intrusive Logins! Just Open the App and Use It!\n* Hunting and Tracking Info at your Fingertips\n* Hunting Log Keeps Track of Important Activity\n* Share Your Hunting Log Photos on Facebook & Twitter\n* Store an unlimited number of locations\n* Game tracking GPS and guidance\n* Graphical wind and scent direction indicator\n* 5 Day Lunar Activity and Weather Forecast\n* Easy to use Compass and Direction Finder\n* Especially suited for Whitetail Deer Hunting\n\n\nCOMPASS\nCompass image with standard compass needle points, digital readout with the bearing in degrees, alphabetic symbols with compass needle heading.\n\nDIGITAL AND MAP GAME TRACKING\nSimply find the first sign of the animal's trail and tap the MARK GPS POSITION button. A coordinate will pop up on the screen. Move on to the next blood drop or broken twig and mark it. If you lose the game's trail, just tap one of the coordinates and the GPS will guide you back to it.\n\nUNLIMITED HUNTING AREAS\nAdd as many locations as you choose. When you tap the ADD NEW HUNTING AREA button, a screen with two tabs will appear:\"\n\nThe BY LOCATION tab prompts you to either choose the location you are at or type in an address. Once the GPS coordinates have been determined, type in a descriptive name and save the location.\n\nThe BY MAP tab lets you zoom in on a specific area. After finding your desired area on the map, simply hold your finger on that area until the scent indicator appears. Then, just type in a descriptive name and tap the SAVE LOCATION button.\n\nTapping a location on the list brings up a menu with four choices:\n\nShow location on map will bring up the map of the location. If the scent indicator is not in the precise position of your choosing, just hold your finger on it until it is draggable, then drag it to the exact location. The slider at the bottom of the map can be dragged to display the wind speed and direction for any specific time during the next 5 day period. You can tap the button at the bottom to cycle through a choice of Street, Hybrid, or Satellite view.\n\nGet directions to location will bring up a screen showing your CURRENT COORDINATES and the DESTINATION COORDINATES. Below that, you will see the DISTANCE TO DESTINATION and BEARING TO DESTINATION. Your CURRENT BEARING will be shown in red. Simply turn toward the destination bearing until both the BEARING TO DESTINATION and the CURRENT BEARING turn green. Then you just walk until the DISTANCE TO DESTINATION reads 0.\n\nDelete the location will delete whatever location you tapped on. Delete all locations will delete every location you've saved. It will not affect your saved tracking coordinates, however.\n\nUP TO THE MINUTE WEATHER UPDATES\nThere are three tabs on the weather page:\n\nThe CURRENT tab displays the current weather in either standard or metric. Notice the SCENT INDICATOR, the same one you'll see on your HUNTING LOCATION page. By tapping the DOWN ARROW in the upper right corner, you can choose which location you'd like the weather to show.\n\nThe FORECAST tab displays the forecasted weather in either standard or metric, depending on what you've chosen on the settings page, over a 5 day period in 3 hour increments.\n\nThe LUNAR tab displays the lunar activity in either 12 or 24 hour time format, depending on what you've chosen on the settings page.\n\nThe combined data is a great indicator of deer or other game activity and the probability of seeing movement.\n\nWith all of this in one easy to use app, why not download HUNTER TRACKER today!"

      "label": "Listen to your racquet and perfect your game!\n\nRacquetTune ensures that your racquet is ideally suited to your style of play. Simple and straightforward to use, the app uses the sound generated by tapping the strings to calculate the tension with high accuracy. In addition, the interactive swingweight calculator aids in customizing your racquet to fit your own stroke pattern, while the stiffness calculator allows you to simulate different racquet configurations. \n\nRacquetTune not only makes it easier to decide when it is time to restring, it is also an invaluable tool when testing different racquets and strings and in identifying which of your racquets is best suited for different types of games. RacquetTune also allows you to check whether your stringer is consistent in his work. \nRacquetTune includes the following user-friendly tools:\n\nTension measurement \n- Quickly determines the tension and stringbed stiffness. \n- Able to detect changes in tension as small as 0.1 kg/0.2 lb.\n- An accuracy indicator ensures results are consistent. \n- Graphical presentation of sound waves helps you find the ideal way of tapping the strings. \n- Settings can be customized to serve tennis, squash, racquetball and badminton racquets, respectively. \n- View the tension history for each racquet as a list or a graph.\n- Email a spreadsheet with test data.\n\nSwingweight calculator \n- Add as many weights as you wish to the frame. \n- Move and change weights to visualize how swingweight, balance and sweet spot location are affected.\n- Enter target values for the racquet and let RacquetTune distribute the weights automatically.\n\nStiffness calculator \n- Simulate various racquet and string configurations\n- Vary tension, string type and racquet head size. \n- Shows load-displacement curves, stiffness and elastic energies \n- Handles the large deformations encountered in actual play \n\nView a demo video at racquettune.com\n\nRacquetTune has been featured in tennis magazines in USA, Italy, France, Germany, Sweden and Norway. \n\n\"The app is very, very impressive. I get more tension diagnostic questions than just about anybody in the universe, so this is a very good thing to be able to recommend.\" \nJonathan Wolfe \nUS Racquet Stringers Association\n\nNote, that the actual string tension in the racquet and the setting seen on a stringing machine are two different things and therefore incomparable - more information can be found at racquettune.com."

But it also calculates and shows the current wind direction and strength, very important for your safety.\n\nA moving and rotating map shows your current flying position and flight trail. It indicates where you have gone up (in a thermal), and where you have had faster than normal decline. With that, you can easily find back that thermal that you lost. The map also shows the nearest known landing spots, and whether they are reachable by normal glide, given your current altitude and wind direction.\n\nIntegration with Bluetooth varios SensBox, FlyNet, GoFly iPico, XC-Tracer, BlueFlyVario, or SkyDrop gives accurate altitude and lift information. That turns your iPhone into an full-fletched GPS-vario, including vario tones.\n\nThe app makes a full log of your flight, that can be analyzed afterwards. Besides normal data like start and landing positions, duration of flight, and an altitude graph of the flight, Flyskyhy also calculates the scoring distances for you. So you can immediately see whether you have broken that FAI triangle record.\n\nYour live location is reported on livetrack24.com or loctome.com if you desire, so anybody can follow your flight while it is happening. If you are flying together with friends, then their location is shown on your map during your flight. So you never have to wonder anymore whether they are in front of or behind you.\n\nThe flight display has multiple screens which are all fully configurable. You can move all elements to other spots, delete and add elements, and resize them.\n\nThrough in-app purchases, the app also supports airspaces and waypoints.\n\nThe app is optimised for paragliding and hang gliders, but can be used with all  kinds of airsports.\n\nMain features during the flight;\n• Altitude, climb rate, ground speed, air speed, direction, glide angle and many more\n• Wind strength and direction\n• Moving map of the flying area\n• Spots where you have had lift, great for thermal coring\n• Shows whether you can still reach a landing spot with the current altitude and wind\n• Live tracking of your flight on livetrack24.com or loctome.com\n• Shows live location of your friends during flight\n\nAfter the flight:\n• Full logbook of all your flights\n• Basic flight data like start/landing, duration, height difference, distance flown, and many more\n• Calculation of 5-points, open triangle, and FAI triangle distances\n• Graph of altitude and climb rate\n• Signed IGC and KML log files of flights\n• Transfer the log to iTunes or send by email\n• Upload the flight directly to XContest, ParaglidingForum, DHV-XC, and other Leonardo servers\n• Open flight in Google Earth on the iPhone\n• Replay the flight and relive it!\n\nBy purchasing the Waypoints Extension you get access to:\n• A fully zoomable and scrollable map with the waypoints and optimised route. The map also shows start and landing spots, as well as restricted airspaces (with the Airspace Extension)\n• Enter new waypoints, either on the map or by specifying the parameters\n• Full route support with start time, goal, entry/exit points, etc. \n• Many instruments to guide you along the route\n• Visible and audible indication when a waypoint has been reached\n• Complete waypoints organiser\n• Import and export of various waypoint file formats\n\nBy purchasing the Airspace Extension you get access to:\n• Airspaces of 30 countries\n• Display of airspaces on the map with configurable colors and formats\n• Display of your vertical position w.r.t. airspaces\n• Visible and audible warnings when approaching and entering an airspace\n• Shows local airspaces by touching a spot on the map\n\nNote: a live internet connection is required for live tracking of your and your friends locations\nNote: continuous GPS and screen usage makes the battery drain faster than normal"

      "label": "The most advanced sports timer in the AppStore! \nFeatured by Apple in the TV-ad \"Strength\". \n\nSprintTimer is a unique sports timer and photo finish app that employs the same techniques as the fully automatic timing equipment (FAT) used at the Olympics. Start the timer and point the camera towards the finish line. The app creates an image where you can scroll to get the time for each competitor with a 0.01 s accuracy*. SprintTimer also includes a motion/human-activated Video Finish for longer races and a Start Sender for wirelessly controlling SprintTimer from another device.\n\nSprintTimer is used by coaches, teachers, and athletes all over the world for practice and competition in, for example, track & field, cycling, skiing, speed skating, car racing, rowing, kayaking, horses or greyhound racing. \n\nSprintTimer has several advantages over a manual stopwatch: \n- One person can time all participants\n- Higher accuracy*\n- Easier to determine the order\n- The image and the results can be saved\n- Can operate \"hands-free\" when started\n- The timer can be started manually, with a sound, or remotely from another device\n\n*See webpage: sprinttimer.app/accuracy\n\n——— Reviews and Comments ———\n\n\"Without a doubt the best App available on the market for sprinters and coaches who want accurate timing to see their development.\"\nspeedendurance.com\n\n\"AMAZING\"\nthepegeek.com\n\n\"Amazing app for physical education teachers or coaches!  I have used it for timing during our track and field, speed quickness & agility, fitness testing, & many more units.  It is very accurate and easy to use and gets the job done quickly!  A must-have!\"\nmertonphysed.weebly.com\n\n \"The app is very professionally set up and you can very easily capture your whole Track event.\"\nwww.melhamada.com\n\n\"Very useful app for measuring and/or verifying close finishes to track and field or road races.\"\nphysedreview.weebly.com\n\nSatisfied users from all over the world:\n- Brilliant.  A fantastic app for use in school athletics lessons\n- Amazing. This application is awesome and the results are really accurate.\n- What a brilliant app! Our £9k photo finish camera broke down and this app was a real lifesaver and worth way more than £1.50! Highly recommended.\n- This app is wonderful. We use it to time all our meets.\n- This is a great app and it is getting better from release to release\n- Nice, nice, nice! Using it for our youth track team. Love it! 5 stars!\n- Exactly what I needed - Fantastic app\n- Thank you so much for developing this amazing app just when we ran out of options.\n- Congratulations on developing a really clever and useful app.\n- Love what you did with the SprintTimer app.\n\n——— In-App Purchases and Subscriptions ———\n\nThe Start Sender and Results Manager features require the purchase of SprintTimer Pro, available as a subscription at $4.99 per year. There is a 2 weeks free trial period.\n\nShould you choose to subscribe to SprintTimer Pro, the purchase will be charged to your Apple ID account. The subscription will be auto-renewed 24 hours prior to the end of the period. You can manage it from the user settings in iTunes after purchasing it, and you will also be able to cancel the auto-renewing subscription from there.\n\nIf you purchase a new SprintTimer Pro subscription during a free trial you will forfeit any free trial remaining from your first subscription.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy: https://sprinttimer.se/privacy\n\n\nIcon runners made by Freepik from Flaticon.com"

Tap the screen once again after your break and the app will display your Break Speed speed.\n\nBreak Speed is more than 10x the accuracy of a radar gun and has become the standard for break shot speed measurements, privately and professionally. With such high precision, you can use Break Speed to provide that feedback you need to improve your breaks. Break harder and more consistently with Break Speed.\n\nDon't worry about others breaking around you or other pool hall noise. Even shouting players won't fool our Break Recognition technology.\n\nFind out why professional pool players are using and recommending Break Speed to others.\n\nOur collaboration with Predator has been very effective. It's been great to work with a team that understands the science of billiards. The Predator R&D team has been testing the application along side their own speed measurement equipment and the Iron Willie robot,  following a number of testing sessions, the Predator R&D team found the application so accurate that a partnership in pool science began.\n\n\"The application is really spot on. During my many testing sessions with the Predator Team there was very little deviation between the Predator testing equipment and the application,\" said Predator Pro Mike Dechaine.\n\nIf you're a serious player, and you don't have Break Speed Powered By Predator, what are you waiting for?"

You can use Dive Log at the dive site or on the dive boat to capture the information about the site while it is fresh in your mind (or your dive guide's mind). You can even capture the GPS coordinates of the dive site using the built in location services of your iOS device. Details about your actual dive can be added immediately after your dive or at the après dive event and later be saved to your desktop computer. The dive buddy feature is fully integrated with Contacts on your iPhone or iPad, letting you capture information about your newest dive buddy or quickly add an existing buddy to a particular dive. The dive data and statistics features let you have an immediate answer the next time your dive guide asks how much weight you used on your last dive or have all the information you need about your dive history when you fill out that next dive waiver.  Metric and Imperial values are supported for all appropriate logbook fields. You can easily enter values using the appropriate units for the situation and view them in your preferred measurement system. You can even explore detailed dive profiles from popular dive computers that you download with your desktop software and later upload to Dive Log on iPhone/iPad. Dive profile data can also be transferred directly from certain dive computers directly via Bluetooth or using a supported Bluetooth accessory and an associated in-app purchase.  \n\nOn Windows, Diving Log 6.0 (www.divinglog.de) is fully integrated with Dive Log on iPhone/iPad and has built in synchronization. Diving Log 6.0 has extensive support for importing data from dive computers and other dive log applications. \n\nOn Mac OS X, logbook information can be imported to Dive Log on iPhone/iPad from a number of compatible applications using the free Dive Log Manager application available from More Mobile Software (www.moremobilesoftware.com/divelog-sync). Dive Log DT (available on the Mac App Store) can be used to directly import a number of dive computers and file formats and can synchronize with Dive Log on iOS.\n\nDive data can be directly downloaded on a Bluetooth LE (Bluetooth 4.0) compatible iPhone, iPad or iPod touch from Bluetooth LE capable dive computers such as the Suunto EON Steel, Suunto EON Core, Suunto D5, Scubapro Galileo 2 (G2), Aladin Sport (Matrix), Aladin H (Matrix), G2 HUD, Aladin A1, Shearwater Teric, Peregrine, Petrel 2, Perdix, Perdix AI, NERD 2, Oceanic VTX, Pro Plus 4, Geo 4.0, VEO 4.0, Aeris A300CS, Aqualung i300C, i550C, i750TC, i770R, Sherwood Wisdom 4, Mares Genius and certain heinrichs weikamp OSTC computers as well as the DiveNav Inc. bluebuddy and Tech Buddy dive logger accessories. Supported Bluetooth LE accessories are available separately.\n\nMares Bluelink Pro is a Bluetooth LE accessory by Mares and available for purchase separately (www.mares.com). The Bluelink Pro allows you transfer dive data from certain Mares dive computers (Puck Pro, Smart, Smart Air, Quad and Quad Air) directly to Dive Log on your Bluetooth LE (Bluetooth 4.0) compatible iPhone, iPad or iPod touch.\n\nDive Computer Buddy (aka DCbuddy) is a Bluetooth LE accessory by DiveNav Inc. (note that the DCbuddy itself is no longer available). The DCbuddy allows you transfer dive data from certain dive computers (including models from Suunto, Oceanic, Aqualung, Aeris, Sherwood, Tusa and Mares) directly to Dive Log on your Bluetooth LE (Bluetooth 4.0) compatible iPhone, iPad or iPod touch."

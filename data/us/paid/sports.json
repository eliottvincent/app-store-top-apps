      "label": "Avy savvy backcountry skiers and riders know that three things count when it comes to the terrain’s influence on avalanches: the slope, the elevation, and the (compass) aspect. And the Avalanche Inclinometer delivers all three. Sure, you can find plenty of inclinometer apps (also known as clinometers) that are designed for carpenters, but Steve's Avalanche Inclinometer is meant for people who spend time in avalanche terrain. \n\nThis app shows the slope, elevation, and aspect in BIG FONTS which are perfect for tired eyes in stormy (or bright-and-too-sunny) weather. And it doesn’t display a gaggle of tiny buttons and widgets to decipher when you should be skiing.\n\nYou can sight across a slope by holding your phone parallel to the slope, or you can sight up or down a slope by sighting along the long-edge of your phone like a gunsight. (Through-the-camera sighting is nifty when the light is just right, but it often isn't.)\n\nWhen you have your phone aligned with the slope, a single tap on the screen will lock the data so you can read it. The Avalanche Inclinometer will even speak to you as you’re measuring the steepness so you won’t need to look at the screen. And the BIG inclinometer dial changes colors based on the slope which provides instant feedback on how the steepness of the terrain is contributing to the likelihood of an avalanche.\n\nAfter measuring the slope, you can tap a single button to share your current GPS location, the slope in degrees, and the elevation. The email includes kml and gpx waypoint files, and a link that will let you quickly see the location in any browser. You can enter the email address one time and the Avalanche Inclinometer will remember it for next time. Less typing; more skiing.\n\nThe Avalanche Inclinometer isn’t free, but apps don’t grow on trees. To buy this app you’ll spend less than buying a beer at a ski resort—think of it as buying Steve a beer!\n\nIn addition to the Avalanche Inclinometer, it is important that you take an avy class, pay attention to the avalanche red flags, use good route finding techniques, and practice your avalanche rescue skills frequently"

By freedivers, for freedivers, our freedive apnea trainer helps you with static apnea tables and lung capacity training so you can effectively increase the time when diving underwater.\r\nSee why STAmina Apnea Trainer is one of the best apnea apps to improve the breath-holding time for freediving, scuba diving and spearfishing, as well as surfing, running, and other water sports with 6 different apnea tables types.\n\n\r\n■ FREEDIVING & SPEARFISHING APNEA TRAINER FEATURES:\n\n\r\n◉ 6 APNEA TABLE OPTIONS \r\nSTAmina Apnea Trainer can create / generate custom apnea (exercises that are automatically created based on the maximum breath-hold and match the user’s level) or let you select from the following customizable table types:\r\n\r\n- O2 deprivation table – accustoms a body to lower oxygen levels. This is achieved by increasing the amount of time that you hold your breath on each attempt, while the resting time is fixed.\r\n\r\n- CO2 Tolerance table – helps a body to adapt to high carbon dioxide levels. This is achieved by decreasing the length of resting time between fixed breath-hold periods.\r\n\r\n- Wonka table – a variation of CO2 tables. Apnea timer starts after the first contraction, the rest time takes one breath.\r\n\r\n- Mix table – tables where apnea time increases and rest time decreases with each round.\r\n\r\n- Custom table – allows mixing of different approaches to create a custom training, thus generating the most effective training program.\r\n\r\n- Pranayama – a breathing technique to decrease stress in the body and relax the nervous system.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ APPLE HEALTH SYNCRONIZATION \n\n\r\n\r\n◉ PERSONALIZED TRAINING WITH VARYING DIFFICULTY\r\nWhen you start working with the application, you set your personal record in breath holding. Based on this data, the app will offer a personalized training program with exercises of 3 difficulty levels to choose from: easy, normal, and hard.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ PERSONALIZED EXERCISE SETTINGS \r\nEach exercise can be edited by setting your own number of repetitions, breath hold time, rest time, etc.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ TRAINING REMINDERS \r\nGet the notification to start your apnea training. Set a reminder in the apnea diver app for the day and the time & get a notification to do a breath holding training session.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ PERSONAL STATISTICS AND DETAILED TRAINING HISTORY\r\nAll your workouts and exercises are recorded in the freedive trainer app to track the detailed progress of each training.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ VOICE GUIDANCE\r\nTraining may be accompanied by voice guidance with male/female voices recorded by professional voice actors. STAmina supports English, French, Russian voice guidance.\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n◉ HEART RATE AND OXYGEN SATURATION TRACKING\r\nTrack your heart rate while doing breath holding exercises (a compatible HR monitor or pulse-oximeter is required) \n\n\r\n\r\n◉ CONTRACTIONS TRACKING \r\nUse our freedive trainer to track unlimited contractions, analyse captured data after exercises\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ CLOUD SYNC / BACKUP\r\nAccess your data on multiple devices and easily restore it in case you switch devices/phones.\n\n\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\nStamina Apnea Trainer allows training breath hold effectively for anyone who cares about all kinds of diving including:\r\n> beginner or professional freedivers;\r\nspearfishers;\r\n> scuba divers to learn how to dive longer on one tank;\r\n> surfers in case of unexpected breath hold;\r\n> underwater sports athletes such as underwater rugby, hockey, etc.\r\n> runners who want to train breath holding & high tolerance to CO2 while running\r\n\r\n_______\r\nInfo https://getstamina.app/\r\nContact https://www.facebook.com/staminamobile/\r\nSupport hello@squarecrowdapps.com"

These musical notes alert you to start your takeaway, start your downswing, and then the third note lines you up with impact. It’s just that easy - you literally download the app, turn it on, grab a club and start swinging to the Tempo of the Tour Pros.\n\nLONG GAME\nThe Long Game Tones will teach you how to swing with the tempo ratio exhibited by the Tour Pros. We measured the time of their backswings and downswings by counting how many frames of video each part took. The magic ratio on full swings turned out to be three parts backswing to one part downswing. Tones are provided for each of the following frame ratios of Tour Tempo - 18/6, 21/7, 24/8 & 27/9. The Tour Tempo Tones have a clear purpose. They establish the intrinsic tempo of the golf swing in your subconscious mind. Once this is accomplished, you will not have to think about tempo while playing. This is what the Tour Pros have already done. You are about to acquire that same ability.\n\nSHORT GAME\nThe Total Game App also contains the Short Game Tones of 14/7, 16/8, 18/9 & 20/10. After the publication of Tour Tempo, John Novosel studied the short game swings of the top touring pros, and discovered that virtually all of them employ a 2 to 1 swing ratio on or around the greens - a different Tempo than the 3 to 1 ratio of the Long Game. This is another reason why the game of golf is so hard to master.      \n\nTEMPO TRACKS\nThe Tempo Tracks are an easy way to integrate Tour Tempo into your daily routine. One of the best ways to use the Tracks is to listen to them while driving to the course before a round of golf. The more you listen to them, the more the Tour Tempo rhythm will be ingrained into your Golf Swing. \n\nFOCUS TRACKS\nThe Focus Tracks are revolutionary relaxation songs that contain the Tones of Tour Tempo. Each Track has a Part II that has binaural tones embedded in the music to get your brain into an optimum state for concentration. This optimum state is more commonly known to athletes as “Being in the Zone.”\n\nVIDEOS\nThe videos give a complete explanation of the Tones and how to use them to immediately and dramatically improve your Total Game.  \n\nDISCOUNT\nThe app is your first step towards a more powerful, consistent golf game, and that is why we are giving you a discount from our Tour Tempo Shop. On the 'Info' screen you will find a one-time discount code good for $10 off on a future purchase at TourTempo.com and TourTempo.eu."

Wouldn’t it be great to be able to dive deeply with one big breath and take incredible pictures for your friends at home? The Apnea Trainer makes it possible! By using it to train three times a week, you can quickly double your underwater time.\n\nThis is the same training principle used by apnea divers. It’s based on a yoga technique which strengthens the diaphragm muscles allowing you to fill your lungs with more oxygen and releasing more carbon dioxide while exhaling. The system is relatively simple and depends on finding the right time intervals which are provided by the program, thus letting you relax and concentrate on your breathing. This will guarantee maximum training success.\nThe program will also come in handy just before the actual dive since a pranayama mode is already included. The Apnea Trainer will help you keep your whole body calm and give you the perfect preparation for those amazing, long-lasting dives. \n\n\nFeatures:\n+ Training to improve free diving time\n\n+ Pranayama mode to calm your body before diving or snorkeling\n\n+ Custom time settings for pro divers\n\n+ Optical and Audio instructions\n\n+ Easy to use interface\n\nUpdated user interface with the help of Bjoern Maser by www.minimalist.ch."

      "label": "Do you love polework but have run out of ideas how to use your poles? Are you looking to engage your horse’s brain as well as their body in a fun and beneficial way? Do you get bored in the arena and need to help finding new ways to keep both you and your horse entertained?\n\nIf the answer is yes to any of the above then you need the Polework Patterns App by Fancy Footwork Equestrian  in your life! \n\nThis app includes 40 different layouts (20 main and 20 random) which are designed to be multi directional and use between one and twenty poles. There are several unique features including:\n\n- the option to search for layouts based on the amount of poles you want to use:\n   • 1–5 poles\n   • 6–10 poles \n   • 11–15 poles \n   • 16–20 poles \n\n- the option to search for exercises based on what area of a horse’s development you want to focus on – here you will find 15 categories including \n   • Balance \n   • Core \n   • Engagement \n   • Response to rider \n   • ... and more!\n\n- a random button which can be used if you can’t decide which layout to go for, or if you like to live a little dangerously! Either way press that random button, watch the poles spin, the confetti fall and then marvel as your layout is revealed! \n\n- all of the layouts have different suggested exercises to use (four options for the main layouts and two options for the random layouts), each of which are colour-coded to show which pace to use, and a proposed difficulty rating attached to help you decide if that exercise is suitable to your horse’s stage of training.\n\n- 120 potential exercises with four suggestions given per exercise as to what areas it could help your horse improve on. (Flexibility, straightness etc) \n\n- a “Favourites” folder where you can add any of the 80 exercises used in the main layouts for quick and easy access.\n\nPolework patterns was developed by the creator of Fancy Footwork Equestrian, Nina Gill. Nina is a qualified coach who runs Polework clinics full-time and is passionate about her work and the many benefits of polework. This passion has led to Fancy Footwork Equestrian collaborating with some of the U.K.’s biggest equestrian YouTubers and influencers, as well as having Polework training articles printed in three of the biggest equine magazines to date. \nWith this app you will never run out of Polework ideas, even the biggest layouts have been designed to be broken down into smaller sections so that those sections can be used as a standalone layout if you don’t have enough poles to build the whole thing."

      "label": "The TRACT Optics Impact Ballistics mobile application takes the guesswork out of long-range shooting and provides data to help the most experienced shooter as well as the beginner or novice. This mobile application is one of the most comprehensive databases of information available today. With virtually every modern ammunition manufacturer’s information listed shooters can match any TRACT rifle scope reticle to their exact cartridge. Simply select your scope, then your ammo/bullet the program will calculate the bullet drop information as it pertains to your reticle automatically. If you cannot find your particular round of ammunition in the program, simply add the Ballistic Coefficient (B.C.) and Muzzle Velocity to the program and you will be good to go. With the ability to import current weather conditions the Impact program will provide up to date Bullet Drop Compensation to help you make accurate shots in the field or at the range. While the mobile application is designed to provide ballistic date without an internet connection, when the user has an internet connection, they are able to access our complete library of videos, articles, and blogs. Simply navigate to the Learn section of the app and you can access the Getting Started section for Rifle Scopes, Binoculars and Spotting Scopes as well as Pro Shooting Tips with videos detailing How To videos showing how to maximize the performance of your optic. You can even shop our complete line of Optics and Accessories right from the App. This app will be continually updated with new ammunition information, new product releases and videos. Selectable options include Meters or Yards, Drag Table, Spin Drift, Sight Height, Printable Dope and BDC cards, the ability to compare loads, atmospheric conditions (manual entry or automatic import), wind direction, sight setting/zero calculator and much more. The program is capable of providing ballistic data out to 2,500 yards. The BDC card allows the shooter to print out a “cheat sheet” that can show the bullet drop at each magnification (for Second Focal Plane scopes) The Dope card provides velocity, energy, path, drop, wind drift, time of flight, # of click value and MOA or MRAD info in 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 yard increments. Weather/Atmospheric conditions can be automatically imported thanks to our direct link to World Weather Online, or you can manually enter the Temperature, Altitude, Barometric Pressure and Humidity through the Conditions section. The conditions section also allows the user to enter Bullet Wind Drift information such as wind speed and direction and provide data in inches, MOA or MRAD. The sight settings section is a great resource for shooters who would like to zero their rifle at a further distance then they are able to shoot. For example, if a user only has access to a 100-yard range but would like his rifle to be zeroed at 200 yards, the Sight Setting section will show the user where his bullet needs to impact on a 100-yard target to be zeroed at 200 yards. Our goal for this app is that it provides you with a comprehensive resource for everything and anything related to TRACT Optics…Where you Belong."

But it also calculates and shows the current wind direction and strength, very important for your safety.\n\nA moving and rotating map shows your current flying position and flight trail. It indicates where you have gone up (in a thermal), and where you have had faster than normal decline. With that, you can easily find back that thermal that you lost. The map also shows the nearest known landing spots, and whether they are reachable by normal glide, given your current altitude and wind direction.\n\nIntegration with Bluetooth varios SensBox, FlyNet, GoFly iPico, XC-Tracer, BlueFlyVario, or SkyDrop gives accurate altitude and lift information. That turns your iPhone into an full-fletched GPS-vario, including vario tones.\n\nThe app makes a full log of your flight, that can be analyzed afterwards. Besides normal data like start and landing positions, duration of flight, and an altitude graph of the flight, Flyskyhy also calculates the scoring distances for you. So you can immediately see whether you have broken that FAI triangle record.\n\nYour live location is reported on livetrack24.com or loctome.com if you desire, so anybody can follow your flight while it is happening. If you are flying together with friends, then their location is shown on your map during your flight. So you never have to wonder anymore whether they are in front of or behind you.\n\nThe flight display has multiple screens which are all fully configurable. You can move all elements to other spots, delete and add elements, and resize them.\n\nThrough in-app purchases, the app also supports airspaces and waypoints.\n\nThe app is optimised for paragliding and hang gliders, but can be used with all  kinds of airsports.\n\nMain features during the flight;\n• Altitude, climb rate, ground speed, air speed, direction, glide angle and many more\n• Wind strength and direction\n• Moving map of the flying area\n• Spots where you have had lift, great for thermal coring\n• Shows whether you can still reach a landing spot with the current altitude and wind\n• Live tracking of your flight on livetrack24.com or loctome.com\n• Shows live location of your friends during flight\n\nAfter the flight:\n• Full logbook of all your flights\n• Basic flight data like start/landing, duration, height difference, distance flown, and many more\n• Calculation of 5-points, open triangle, and FAI triangle distances\n• Graph of altitude and climb rate\n• Signed IGC and KML log files of flights\n• Transfer the log to iTunes or send by email\n• Upload the flight directly to XContest, ParaglidingForum, DHV-XC, and other Leonardo servers\n• Open flight in Google Earth on the iPhone\n• Replay the flight and relive it!\n\nBy purchasing the Waypoints Extension you get access to:\n• A fully zoomable and scrollable map with the waypoints and optimised route. The map also shows start and landing spots, as well as restricted airspaces (with the Airspace Extension)\n• Enter new waypoints, either on the map or by specifying the parameters\n• Full route support with start time, goal, entry/exit points, etc. \n• Many instruments to guide you along the route\n• Visible and audible indication when a waypoint has been reached\n• Complete waypoints organiser\n• Import and export of various waypoint file formats\n\nBy purchasing the Airspace Extension you get access to:\n• Airspaces of 30 countries\n• Display of airspaces on the map with configurable colors and formats\n• Display of your vertical position w.r.t. airspaces\n• Visible and audible warnings when approaching and entering an airspace\n• Shows local airspaces by touching a spot on the map\n\nNote: a live internet connection is required for live tracking of your and your friends locations\nNote: continuous GPS and screen usage makes the battery drain faster than normal"

As the perfect mum or dad watching all your kids' Ice Hockey games, be the one setting the ambiance for the team AND being where the heater is! Talk to the scoreboard guru and offer to play music during the games. Nothing simpler, get the app, setup your playlist with the perfect start time for each song, and plug your phone to the rink's audio system. That's it! All the kids will vote for you to play at all the games now. You will see, the time at the rink will fly and you will be looking forward to the next game like never before and you will never freeze again. I wrote that app for my son, it changed the way I see rinks now. The team was even convincing home teams we were visiting to let me play music for the travel games!   \n\nThis is the perfect Dad's app for Ice Hockey Entertainment music management and playlist. Play Pump up Songs, Face Off, and Crowd Power Up to cheer up for your team. \n\n24 songs included in this version of the app. These songs by Audionautix and Kevin MacLeod are licensed under Creative Commons Attribution license. The 36 buttons of the app can be reprogrammed with any of your own songs from your iTunes library. (Horns, Organs, ...). \n\nThe latest addition is a full screen of your best team teams' Horns! It comes included! If I am missing your favorite team, contact me on instagram @HockeyDJApp.\n\n12 suggested links to iTunes titles which will pump up your kid's team.\n\nEvery button is customizable and can be set to point to the songs you own in your iTunes Local Library (No need for iTunes Cloud Subscription). You can purchase more screens if you want, up to 15 extra screens giving you a total of 216 customizable buttons.\n\nThe cool thing about the buttons is that you can set you own starting time per song, placing the play button at the best moment of the song to have a maximum effect on your DJ skills and for the please of the parents and players at the rink.\n\nThe \"Horn\" and \"1min Left in the game\" buttons are also customizable, and now you can recall the previous song after playing a goal announcement.\n\nVia InApp purchase, you can record your own voice for quick announcements and set on the \"1min Left Button\" (or on any other buttons).\n\nWith additional inApp purchases, you can play announcements for Penalties, by selecting : The voice, the player, the team, the time and type of penalty. Then you just need to press the ready and play button. With version 5.0 and above, you can also record player roster names. This will be played on demand when you announce penalties. You can even use it to record your own announcements and play them on the rink speakers as you would play any songs from the app.\n\nDisclaimer : Copyrighted songs (120 suggested) are not included in the Apps. This latest version will let you use your iTunes Cloud Music Subscription to select your songs. From the Settings screen, you can find a button to pre-load each screen with specific startup time for each song."

      "label": "Dive Log is designed to work either as your primary SCUBA diving logbook application or in conjunction with compatible 3rd party desktop logbook applications. You can use Dive Log at the dive site or on the dive boat to capture the information about the site while it is fresh in your mind (or your dive guide's mind). You can even capture the GPS coordinates of the dive site using the built in location services of your iOS device. Details about your actual dive can be added immediately after your dive or at the après dive event and later be saved to your desktop computer. The dive buddy feature is fully integrated with Contacts on your iPhone or iPad, letting you capture information about your newest dive buddy or quickly add an existing buddy to a particular dive. The dive data and statistics features let you have an immediate answer the next time your dive guide asks how much weight you used on your last dive or have all the information you need about your dive history when you fill out that next dive waiver.  Metric and Imperial values are supported for all appropriate logbook fields. You can easily enter values using the appropriate units for the situation and view them in your preferred measurement system. You can even explore detailed dive profiles from popular dive computers that you download with your desktop software and later upload to Dive Log on iPhone/iPad. Dive profile data can also be transferred directly from certain dive computers directly via Bluetooth or using a supported Bluetooth accessory and an associated in-app purchase.  \n\nOn Windows, Diving Log 6.0 (www.divinglog.de) is fully integrated with Dive Log on iPhone/iPad and has built in synchronization. Diving Log 6.0 has extensive support for importing data from dive computers and other dive log applications. \n\nOn Mac OS X, logbook information can be imported to Dive Log on iPhone/iPad from a number of compatible applications using the free Dive Log Manager application available from More Mobile Software (www.moremobilesoftware.com/divelog-sync). Dive Log DT (available on the Mac App Store) can be used to directly import a number of dive computers and file formats and can synchronize with Dive Log on iOS.\n\nDive data can be directly downloaded on a Bluetooth LE (Bluetooth 4.0) compatible iPhone, iPad or iPod touch from Bluetooth LE capable dive computers such as the Suunto EON Steel, Suunto EON Core, Suunto D5, Scubapro Galileo 2 (G2), Aladin Sport (Matrix), Aladin H (Matrix), G2 HUD, Aladin A1, Shearwater Teric, Peregrine, Petrel 2, Perdix, Perdix AI, NERD 2, Oceanic VTX, Pro Plus 4, Geo 4.0, VEO 4.0, Aeris A300CS, Aqualung i300C, i550C, i750TC, i770R, Sherwood Wisdom 4, Mares Genius and certain heinrichs weikamp OSTC computers as well as the DiveNav Inc. bluebuddy and Tech Buddy dive logger accessories. Supported Bluetooth LE accessories are available separately.\n\nMares Bluelink Pro is a Bluetooth LE accessory by Mares and available for purchase separately (www.mares.com). The Bluelink Pro allows you transfer dive data from certain Mares dive computers (Puck Pro, Smart, Smart Air, Quad and Quad Air) directly to Dive Log on your Bluetooth LE (Bluetooth 4.0) compatible iPhone, iPad or iPod touch.\n\nDive Computer Buddy (aka DCbuddy) is a Bluetooth LE accessory by DiveNav Inc. (note that the DCbuddy itself is no longer available). The DCbuddy allows you transfer dive data from certain dive computers (including models from Suunto, Oceanic, Aqualung, Aeris, Sherwood, Tusa and Mares) directly to Dive Log on your Bluetooth LE (Bluetooth 4.0) compatible iPhone, iPad or iPod touch."

      "label": "Pickleball Score Keeper is the first Pickleball app designed for Apple Watch. It turns your Apple Watch into a simple and easy-to-use score tracking device. All matches are stored on your iPhone and key statistics give you insights on how to improve your game.\n- Keep track of all your matches (with or without an Apple Watch)\n- Singles and doubles match modes\n- Identify teammates and opponents\n- Track your unforced errors\n- Service statistics\n- Player database to keep notes on opponent strengths and weaknesses\n- Follow live matches point by point\n- Integrates with Health app (steps taken, running distance, maximum heart rate, calories burned) to help you gain insight into your Pickleball workouts as well as to monitor how hard your opponents make you work\n\n---\nHow to use the Watch app:\nIt is so simple. Just start the app from your Apple Watch.\n- Select game setup (i.e.: Doubles, Game to 11, Win by 2)\n- Swipe towards you when you win a rally.\n- Swipe away from you when you lose a rally.\n- Swipe right to record an unforced error.\n- Swipe left to undo.\n- Press down on the watch face to end session or restart a game.\n\nTIP! Swipe from the middle of the watch, not the edge.\n\nScores are spoken aloud and gentle vibrations allow you to continue play without looking at your watch.\nPlayer positions and current server are shown on the watch face in case you lose track.\n\nIMPORTANT:\nThe watch is by default set to wake on wrist raise. If Pickleball Score Keeper does not open on Wrist Raise gesture during a match, please do the following from the watch home screen:\n1. Tap Settings > tap General > tap Wake Screen \n2. Make sure that \"Wake Screen on Wrist Raise\" is turned on. \n3. Scroll down to \"Resume to: Previous Activity\" and checkmark.\n\nPlease don’t be shy to use the Feedback button on the Pickleball Score Keeper iPhone app to contact us with ideas and suggestion.

First light and last light are based on sunrise and sunset, and those times change from day-to-day. \n\nShooting Light simply shows you when those times are. It doesn't show weather, and it's not part of another app that requires a yearly subscription and offers you things you don't need. It's a simple tool to show you first and last light, and optionally sunrise and sunset.\n\n* Keep track of available light\nDid work let out early? Catch an unexpected break from the family? Finish the chores in time for an evening hunt? Open Shooting Light to see how many hours of hunting you have left for the day. It might just be the thing that helps you decide to get out and sends you home with that next big buck.\n\n* Notifications\nYou can easily enable notifications for the day by tapping the bell in the top left corner. This will schedule notifications for first light and last light so you can leave your phone in your pocket and let it alert you when you're able to start your hunt or when it's time to end it.\n\n* Scheduler\nShooting light also comes with a tool that many of us have been waiting for. Doing time math in your head can be tricky – the scheduler lets you set a start time for your hunt and add time for things like packing up, driving, and walking to the spot. It'll do the math for you and let you know exactly when you should wake up or start getting ready.\n\n* Customize times for your area\nEvery state and often hunting areas within your state have different regulations for when you can start or when you must end your hunt. You can customize the offset for first and last light to set it up for your specific hunt area. Keep in mind, it's your responsibility to make sure you're following your state's rules and regulations.\n\nRegardless of if you're hunting deer, elk, duck, or anything else, you can use Shooting Light to track when you should start/stop your hunt.\n\nGood luck and good huntin!"

Simple and straightforward to use, the app uses the sound generated by tapping the strings to calculate the tension with high accuracy. In addition, the interactive swingweight calculator aids in customizing your racquet to fit your own stroke pattern, while the stiffness calculator allows you to simulate different racquet configurations. \n\nRacquetTune not only makes it easier to decide when it is time to restring, it is also an invaluable tool when testing different racquets and strings and in identifying which of your racquets is best suited for different types of games. RacquetTune also allows you to check whether your stringer is consistent in his work. \nRacquetTune includes the following user-friendly tools:\n\nTension measurement \n- Quickly determines the tension and stringbed stiffness. \n- Able to detect changes in tension as small as 0.1 kg/0.2 lb.\n- An accuracy indicator ensures results are consistent. \n- Graphical presentation of sound waves helps you find the ideal way of tapping the strings. \n- Settings can be customized to serve tennis, squash, racquetball and badminton racquets, respectively. \n- View the tension history for each racquet as a list or a graph.\n- Email a spreadsheet with test data.\n\nSwingweight calculator \n- Add as many weights as you wish to the frame. \n- Move and change weights to visualize how swingweight, balance and sweet spot location are affected.\n- Enter target values for the racquet and let RacquetTune distribute the weights automatically.\n\nStiffness calculator \n- Simulate various racquet and string configurations\n- Vary tension, string type and racquet head size. \n- Shows load-displacement curves, stiffness and elastic energies \n- Handles the large deformations encountered in actual play \n\nView a demo video at racquettune.com\n\nRacquetTune has been featured in tennis magazines in USA, Italy, France, Germany, Sweden and Norway. \n\n\"The app is very, very impressive. I get more tension diagnostic questions than just about anybody in the universe, so this is a very good thing to be able to recommend.\" \nJonathan Wolfe \nUS Racquet Stringers Association\n\nNote, that the actual string tension in the racquet and the setting seen on a stringing machine are two different things and therefore incomparable - more information can be found at racquettune.com."

      "label": "An extensive overhaul of the app is now complete, making a 4.5/5 star app even better! This upgrade is packed with lots of new features and a new interface that supports both portrait and landscape modes.\n\nWith iTouchStats Basketball, you are in control over how much data you want to track.  The most popular method is to track individual player stats for one team while tracking just the opponent's team stats, as shown in the 1st screen shot.  Or you can track individual player stats for both teams, as shown in the 2nd screen shot.  Which stats you track for each team is up to you.   Even the use of the game clock and shot location tracking are optional.  \n\nA unique feature of iTouchStats Basketball is the quick stat icons that appear next to a player's photo or jersey.  These icons coordinate with the stat button colors, giving you an easy way to see a player's key stats without needing to leave the main scoring screen.  Icons include: Points (Green), Fouls (Red), Turnovers (Orange), Assists (Yellow), Steals (Gray), and Blocks (Brown).  By double-tapping on a player, you can get even more stat details including shot charts and shooting percentages.\n \nNEW ▸▸  One of the coolest features added in v4.0 is the team bench that appears at the bottom of the score keeping screen.  The bench greatly improves player subbing and also gives you easy access to viewing the stats of the players not in the game.  You can even register a stat to a player on the bench if a sub-in was missed.\n \nNEW ▸▸  User Definable Rating System (This system has the ability to give individual values to each stat, allowing a quick easy way for a coach or parent to see how a player performed in a game based on these values.)\n\nNEW ▸▸  User Definable Stat Button (This definable stat button can also be turned off in the game reports.)\n\nNEW ▸▸  Team quick stats are displayed in the scoreboard. \n \nNEW ▸▸  iCloud Data Backups\n\nNEW ▸▸  Half Timeouts have been added as an option.\n\nNEW ▸▸  Running Clock is an added Rules option.\n\nIMPROVED ▸▸  Game and season PDF reports.  Not only has the look improved, but you can now choose which stats are displayed on PDF reports.  For example, if the game clock is not used and deflections are not tracked, then you can turn these fields off in PDF reports.\n\nIMPROVED ▸▸  Stat viewing options.  You can now view a team or player(s) stats by periods.  For example, you could use this to compare how your starters did in the 2nd half vs. the 1st half.  You could even do this over multiple games!\n    \nIMPROVED ▸▸  Season, Team, and Player management.  For users who track multiple seasons, you will now only see data relating to your \"Default\" season, but changing between seasons can be done easily. \n\n▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸\nDETAILED STAT LIST\n▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸\n▸ 2-Point, 3-Point, Free Throws, Field Goals (Made, Attempts, and % for each) \n ▸ Rebounds (Offensive, Defensive, Dead Ball)  \n▸ Assists  \n▸ Blocks  \n▸ Steals  \n▸ Turnovers (optional Forced or Unforced: Out of Bounds, Lost Ball, Ball Handling, Bad Pass, Back Court, 3 Sec, 5 Sec, 10 Sec, Shot Clock, Other)  \n▸ Fouls (optional: Offensive, Defensive, Flagrant, Team Technical, Player Technical)  \n▸ Charges Taken \n▸ Deflections   \n▸ Forced Jump Balls \n ▸ Efficiency (Stat formula taken from http://www.nba.com/statistics/efficiency.html) \n▸ Rating (User Definable Rating System)\n ▸ Minutes Played  \n▸ Games (Started, Played)  \n▸ User Definable Stat Button\n\n▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸\nView app videos and download sample PDF reports at iTouchStats.com\n▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸▸"

Includes support for rally or sideout scoring, side switches, libero serving, and non-standard start/end scores.  Replaces and far exceeds the functionality of a plastic rotation locator costing $8-10...it even reminds you when you have scheduled substitutions!  Made by volleyball coaches for volleyball coaches – we use it ourselves for every match.\n\n\"Used the app for about 6 matches now and I love it. Thank you for this as it is exactly what I have been needing. A feature that I didn't really notice right away and have come to love is the 'undo' screen. A great tool when you have to prove where the score keeper made a mistake!\" - Coach Scott\n\nPlease click on Reviews (select \"All Versions\")  to see other reviews of VBLT from coaches like you.  Thanks and please keep those reviews coming so others can find us and join the thousands of coaches already using Volleyball Lineup Tracker! :)\n\n\nFor the best results, when you first start, run through the tutorial at http://tinyurl.com/VBLineupTrackerTutorial to get familiarized with the app. (Note: this has not been updated for recent versions of the app yet, but should still be very helpful for the basic features.)"

Tap the screen once again after your break and the app will display your Break Speed speed.\n\nBreak Speed is more than 10x the accuracy of a radar gun and has become the standard for break shot speed measurements, privately and professionally. With such high precision, you can use Break Speed to provide that feedback you need to improve your breaks. Break harder and more consistently with Break Speed.\n\nDon't worry about others breaking around you or other pool hall noise. Even shouting players won't fool our Break Recognition technology.\n\nFind out why professional pool players are using and recommending Break Speed to others.\n\nOur collaboration with Predator has been very effective. It's been great to work with a team that understands the science of billiards. The Predator R&D team has been testing the application along side their own speed measurement equipment and the Iron Willie robot,  following a number of testing sessions, the Predator R&D team found the application so accurate that a partnership in pool science began.\n\n\"The application is really spot on. During my many testing sessions with the Predator Team there was very little deviation between the Predator testing equipment and the application,\" said Predator Pro Mike Dechaine.\n\nIf you're a serious player, and you don't have Break Speed Powered By Predator, what are you waiting for?"

The app gives you duration, distance, speed and altitude as well as your exact position and track lines on a map while tracking.\n\nThe web site stores your tracks in an archive under your account that enables you to log in and view and edit your tracks. Using the app, you can be as anonymous as you like since you track under an Alias, and you can even set the tracks to be private (not listed or searchable on locatoweb.com). \n\nThe app only records your position when a track has been set up and started and lasts until you stop it. It is frequently used to track bicycle rides, road trips, hiking trips and other outdoor adventures where you want to show your friends and family where you are, or to simply track your adventures for your own pleasure.\n\nThere is also a safety aspect of using LocaToWeb. If you have the track running and something happens, your wife, husband and friends can see the exact location of where you are. Maybe you are riding your bike and falls off hitting your head, or you just want to be safe when walking home alone at night. \n\nKey features:\n\n- Share your position to web in real time\n- Monitor duration, distance, speed and altitude\n- See your exact position and track line on a map\n- Capture and upload photos while tracking\n- Set up race groups that tracks several participants\n- Choose your units system (metric/imperial)\n- Possible to keep the screen alive while tracking\n- Resume a track that has been stopped\n- View and edit your archived tracks anytime on the web site\n- Just install and track, no registering is required\n\nNote that continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

      "label": "THE BEST VIDEO REPLAY APP!\n- Number 1 in the Sports iPad Category!!!\n- Trusted by the US major league baseball and basketball teams.\n\nAre you frustrated by making the same mistakes and wasting time on your practice? Video Delay Instant Replay is a fantastic way for athletes to receive instant feedback on their performance. Analyze your form, build good muscle memory, and get faster results. \n\nMake every practice satisfying and effective!\n\nThere are three main features: the DELAY, the SLO-MO, and the REPLAY.\n\nThe DELAY Mode continuously shows the delayed video during practice. After setting the buffer time, there's no need to record and replay manually. The video feedback will be on until you reset the buffer or hit the exit button.\n\nThe SLO-MO Mode captures a short video and instantly replays it in slow motion. It works best for quick activities, like punch or shoot. To adjust the speed rate, use the slider. The recording will get you short slow-motion videos of every repetition. \n\nThe REPLAY View* allows frame-by-frame analysis of athlete moves, including measuring the angles. You can also export a short part of the replay video using AB selection.\n* It works only with Delay mode and a buffer time longer than 1 second.\n\nImprove your skills and get faster results:\n1. Set the Buffer time.\n2. Do your action.\n3. Watch the video feedback.\n4. Immediately correct your posture and repeat!\n\nCoaches and teachers! \nUse the app with an external screen for even better feedback during practice! Watch the Replay video with your team, analyze your players' performance, and correct errors. Add lines on the screen to check out the angles. Trim the video, so it only shows what you want your students to concentrate on. Record only necessary parts of the practice. Instant Feedback also helps to settle disputes between players.\n\nBasketball, baseball, and football players! \nPractice by repetition -  improve your shooting form by copying your favorite players' moves. Make out the best of your hitting drill. Take a quick look at the footage, correct your posture, and return to the action. No need to rewind or touch the device; the video will play instantly. You will be able to see if your pose is good and if your fake moves are effective. \n\nGolf and tennis players! \nUse a motion-detection grid and correct your swing or backhand instantly! Perform proper movements and maintain good posture while exercising. Build better muscle memory and improve your game!\n\nTraining martial arts, archery, or shooting? \nStudy your form with delayed video feedback. Set a short delay time and analyze your moves in slow motion. See what to correct in your kicks or punches.\n\nPilates or yoga fan? \nCheck out poses you won’t see in the mirror, like dog or pigeon. Make sure you are true to form and protect yourself from injury.\n\nActors and performers!\nReplay yourself performing and improve your acting skills. Check out your gestures in slow-motion and make them the best!\n\nFor information on how to use the VDIR, please check out the User Guide in the app!"

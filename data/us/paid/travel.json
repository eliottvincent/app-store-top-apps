      "label": "There are 140+ audio points that play automatically along the scenic drive, featuring the best things to see and do, stories, tips and driving directions.  \n\nProfessional tour guides share advice on how to prioritize your time at recommended “not to be missed” viewpoints, suggested side-trips and places of interest.\n\nTours work offline, using free GPS signal and location services, so no data roaming, network, or wifi is required while touring.\n\nVisit www.gypsyguide.com for route maps, sample audio, tips and advice and what to know before you go.\n\nIt’s Just Like Having a Tour Guide in Your Car™\n\nWHAT TO EXPECT:  \nThe Road to Hana is one of the world’s most scenic drives and a popular sightseeing activity to see Maui’s spectacular waterfalls, black sand beaches, bamboo forests, lava rock formations and amazing ocean views as you wind your way through 620 curves and 59 bridges.\n\nIf you prefer travelling independently, at your own pace, GyPSy Guide provides the best Road to Hana tour experience, along with the freedom to choose what you enjoy; squishing the black sand between your toes at Wai’anapanapa, hiking the Pipiwai Bamboo Trail, or maybe time to enjoy an extra slice of banana bread.\n\nYou can’t help but cheer on the world class windsurfers at Ho’okipa.  And you won’t need to worry about photoshopping the Rainbow Eucalyptus at the Ke’anae Arboretum or the stunning contrast between blue water and black lava rock at Ke’anae Peninsular.\n\nTake a moment to cool off with a quick swim at the pristine Hamoa Beach and see where Haleakala National Park descends from the summit to the sea and the “Seven Sacred Pools” of Oheo at the end of the drive.\n\nWith such a long day of exploring (expect 8-12 hours), it’s important to know the 5 “not to be missed” stops, and the many more suggestions if you have time.  Part of the secret to enjoying the journey is knowing how not to waste your time, and we have tips for that as well.\n\nOn the return drive from Hana, we’ll point out the not to be missed stops again as well as tell you stories about Hawaii’s fascinating history and rich culture.\n\nPlease note Highway #31 ‘backside route’ is not recommended for driving. Rental car insurance void.   Road can be closed for repairs, mudslides and flash floods.\n  \nWHAT YOU’LL SEE:\n\nSome of the highlights along the route include;\n\n•\tHo’okipa Beach Park\n•\tPaia\n•\tKe’anae Peninsular\n•\tWai’anapanapa Park, Black Sand Beach\n•\tHana\n•\tHamoa Beach\n•\tWailua Falls\n•\tTwin Falls\n•\tUpper Waikanai Falls (3 Bears)\n•\tPools of O’heo (Seven Sacred Pools)\n•\tPipiwai Bamboo Trail\n\n**Reservations to visit Wai'anapanapa State Park and black sand beach are now mandatory** \n\n\nBATTERY USAGE:\n++  Continued use of GPS/Location Services in the background increases battery usage.  We strongly recommend taking a cigarette style (DC outlet) car charger.  Avoid using a direct connection to the USB port of a rental vehicle.\n\nIPADS:\n** iPad models must include a GPS chip. Please note that Apple only install these on the iPad Wifi + Cellular models.  Wifi only iPad models have limited location service capabilities and are unable to play commentary automatically.\n\nDOWNLOADING:\nThe apps are larger in size in order to work offline.  You must be on wifi to download as the store may block the download over cellular networks.  \n\nABOUT US:\n\nGyPSy Guide™ produce award winning narrated audio tours along scenic drives and road trips around the world.  \n\nEnjoyed by travelers who prefer to set their own pace and itinerary on vacation, but enjoy a fun, informative and educational guided experience while driving themselves.  \n\nOur goal is to provide a great introduction to the region and inspire you to learn more and return.  \n\nNone of our apps include paid advertising or placements for benefit"

In cities like New York where you have to swipe your transit card to unlock the turnstile, forgetting your balance and being greeted by an \"insufficient funds\" message can be annoying, and delay your journey.\n\nMetroBuddy lets you enter your current MetroCard balance, and update it each time you swipe. Never lose time at the MetroCard reader again, your balance will always be available on your phone! The app also calculates how many rides you have left, based on your fare. Use the History tab to review the changes you made to your balance.\n\nMetroBuddy also provides Siri shortcuts to record a swipe and check your balance. This enables you to build powerful automation for your commute, such as recording a swipe, starting your favorite playlist, and checking the next train departure.\n\nIf you are using iOS 14 or later, you can add a widget to your home screen or your widget center to view your balance even faster.\n\nWe are proud to be working on making MetroBuddy as inclusive as possible. You can change your fare if you have a more affordable one. The app is also fully compatible with iOS assistive technologies such as VoiceOver, Dynamic Type, and VoiceControl. Turnstiles are not fully accessible, but MetroBuddy is.\n\nDo not hesitate to reach out with feedback and/or questions by e-mail at hi@alexisonline.dev.\n\nPlease note that MetroBuddy is a hobby app and is not affiliated with New York's MTA in any way."

This makes it much easier to find RV dump stations along a route you've created in another app such as Road Trip Planner.\n- Send a dump station location to our app Road Trip Planner.  This helps in routing your travels (requires separate purchase of the Road Trip Planner app).\n\nWe want to expand our RV dump station database as much as possible, so we have made it easy for you to easily submit a new RV dump station - simply tap the + button below the map.  To correct or update dump station information, tap “Location Comment” in the detail view. We will be updating the database often.\n\nDue to the nature of dump stations constantly changing their status it's recommended you contact the dump station prior to using it to verify its existence."

Get Airborne.\n\nOr access LOCAL INFO--before you depart, just after arrival--anytime. \n\nMilSpaceA app allows authorized U.S. government users to register for Department of Defense (DoD) military space-available travel. It is the exclusive app for all DoD travelers wanting a quick, easy, reliable, and authorized means to sign up for Space-A at primary departure terminals. \n\nVISITING FAMILY MEMBERS and TDY military & contractors are now using MilSpaceA app as well--there's MUCH MORE here than just space-a signup.\n\nExpanded LOCAL INFO: billeting, car rental, dining, Exchange info, links to air terminals' pages, USOs, & more.\nAIRCRAFT GALLERY: depictions & basic descriptions of DoD pax aircraft\nTRAVEL ADVISORIES - announcements of temporary conditions affecting space-a\nSIGNUP ARCHIVE - stored in-app (as well as in user's own e-mail \"Sent\" items)\nFOREIGN CURRENCY - daily exchange rates for AOIs\nDOCUMENT LIBRARY:  key space-a documents:  policy, guides, handbooks, AMCGrams\nENHANCED ONLINE MAPPING: Your location shown relative to points of interest in the app (requires active geolocation & Internet access). \n\nFirst, browse through \"Airfields of Interest\".  Call ahead to various terminals (call-enabled for iPhone) or visit terminals’ flight schedule pages (if they have them--most don't). Then fill in your details, select departure airfields and destination countries, and send out the signup to register for travel. Some terminals will reply; most will not. Just keep a copy of e-mail(s) as proof of signup.\n\n• Remote space-a signup for multiple airfields. Prepare off- or online--then transmit when you have connectivity.\n• Multi-branch terminal support (Air Force, Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, Guard & Reserve)\n• Complies with Air Mobility Command rules: Signups generated by you, your e-mail as the sender & reply-to address. Copies saved directly in your e-mail Sent items, retrievable anytime.\n• Data privacy: No SSAN required. Exclusive AMC-authorized Pseudo Person ID (PPID) auto-created. (Some Navy locations still insist on SSANs--contact them directly after signup to pass SSAN).  \n• NEW: Now includes optional fields for DoD ID numbers, dates of birth, and passport info.\n• Full control of your data--ability to purge anytime.\n\n***\n\"My mom came to visit me and she used the app, too (...) It's great for anyone visiting [the base].\" - LT\n\"Amazing how easy this app made our trip. This and our books together, because weird or not, I still like the smell of paper\" - JD\n\"Great app. Very easy to use\" - TT\n***\n\nPolicies governing space-a are implemented in DoD Directive 4515.13-R (Air Transportation Eligibility) and AMCI 24-101 Vol 14. Determine your eligibility before registering for travel. CONTACT YOUR LOCAL TERMINAL if you have any questions of eligibility. Refer to http://www.amc.af.mil/amctravel for current official AMC policy. Utilize and support pepperd.com, spacea.net & takeahop.org for unofficial discussions, info, and desktop-based space-a signup.\n\nOnly after mission requirements are met will remaining seats be offered up for space-a. Be prepared for delays or short-notice diversions. Space-A is a privilege, not a right--movement is never guaranteed. UNDERSTAND THE BASICS OF SPACE-A before signing up.\n\nMore about Take-a-Hop--and its MilSpaceA app)\n\nSince inception, Take-a-Hop's platform has generated MILLIONS of space-a signups. Trusted by passengers and passenger service agents (PSAs) alike. Used by tens of thousands of DoD travelers. Solely managed by a USAF veteran who has also traveled military space-a and knows what travelers are up against. MilSpaceA app is not endorsed by the US Federal Government, DoD, or any branch thereof. And still, it's the name recommended by thousands and earning your trust for years.\n\nThanks and Happy Travels!\n\nWEB at www.takeahop.com/app\nLIKE on www.facebook.com/takeahop"

Use the \"Layers\" icon to select which agencies you want displayed to create your own custom map. (Hint, the toggles are color coded to the color each layer is displayed in.)\n\n- Links are provided to each agency's website within the app, so that you can further your research as to what land use rules apply for each public land type - such as permits, fees, activities allowed, and limits of stay.\n\n- Map layers are stored on device - no internet connection required.\n\n- Be sure to turn on the 'Basic' base map to see the US Public Land labels for each land area. This base map layer is also stored entirely on your device, and can be utilized if you do not have an internet connection or would like to conserve bandwidth. \n\n- If you have an internet connection (or have cached them before going out of signal), you can utilize the built in Apple Maps and satellite view maps as the base layer underneath the public land overlays.\n\n- A boondocker's assistant - While US Public Lands is not specifically a camp site locator and does not have a database of specific sites, by turning on the satellite view map, you can better scout out trails, roads and signs of dispersed camping locations within the boundaries of the public land resources. \n\n- Quickly toggle between 'Show' and 'Hide' via the \"Map\" icon to more clearly see satellite images below.\n\n- If you have GPS access on your device, click the 'Locate Me' icon to show your present location - know what type of land you're on right now!\n\n- Built in search tool locates anything on device maps supports (requires internet access) - including cities, states, zip codes, addresses and points of interest. A pin is dropped at the search location.\n\n\nThank you to the Protected Area Database (PAD-US) of the U.S. Geological Survey for providing the public domain raw map data that we’ve been able to utilize to create this interactive overlayable mapping & navigation tool. We will update our maps in the future to stay in sync with improvements to this data set. \n\nPlease note, the USGS PAD-US database contains the “most up-to-date aggregation of Federal lands and waters” available, but this database is still evolving and some locations may not be listed and others may not have precisely accurate boundaries. Resolution across the nation may vary. And always remember - there may be private unmapped inholdings within any public lands - so always pay attention to local signage, indications, and information. \n\nThe US Public Lands app should only be used as an overview, and you should always confirm more precise details by consulting local field offices, administration websites, and other resources. Do not solely rely on this app for determining if you are on public or private land."

Follow it as it proceeds among the other traffic. Just tap the small blue dot to exit follow mode and return to the main map.\n\nMultiple Filters\nJust want to see aircraft below 10'000 feet, Boeing 747s or only planes from a certain airline? You can filter by altitude, type, callsign or registration. Filters can be combined, too.\n\nCustomizability\nCustomize the display using many options. You only want to see helicopters and hide all small airports? You can do that and much more...\n\nComplications Support\nWith many different complications available, designed to fit into all color schemes, PlaneWatcher is always just a tap away.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.planewatcher.app/privacy.html\nTerms of Use: https://www.planewatcher.app/terms.html"

You get some rest, maybe shop a bit and move on early in the morning.\n\nHow will this app help you? RVer or not, this app shows all Walmart locations in US and Canada. Use it to find shopping now and for RVing later.\n\nWant to know where every Walmart is located and which ones have been reported to allow and don't allow overnight parking?\n\nFilter map to see if has fuel, pharmacy, garden center, a restaurant and much more.\n\nThis app plots every Walmart store in the USA and Canada on the map view. It uses location services to find your location and as you move.\n\nLocal influence and RVer abuse have meant that about 1/4 of stores no longer allow overnights, so you might want ask a manager ahead of time. Please submit your reports to us so we can keep this app accurate. I get numerous reports about stores every single day. It’s always changing...\n\nWhat's in it: Walmart's of all kinds. Can you park there or have others been denied or even towed? Tips are provided from other RVers as to where to park in the lot. \n\nIt integrates nicely with maps to display up to 150 points of interest on a map.\n\nDon’t take even one more trip without Walmart Overnight Parking. It can always change by the time you get there but at least you can be aware of what others have experienced lately.\n\nAllstays LLC, the provider of this App is not affiliated with, sponsored by or in any way related to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.

IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR DISNEYLAND IN CALIFORNIA, CHECK OUT OUR OTHER APP \"HIDDEN MICKEYS: DISNEYLAND\"•\n\nThere's an extra special way to enjoy Walt Disney World and this app is your guide. Hunting for \"Hidden Mickeys\" (images of Mickey Mouse cleverly concealed in WDW's theme parks, restaurants, hotels, and other areas by Disney artists and designers) is fun for all and a bona fide vacation mission for many Disney World fans.\n\nServing as the OFFICIAL application to Steven Barrett’s bestselling book “Hidden Mickeys – A Field Guide to Walt Disney World's Best Kept Secrets,” the mouse hunt is taken to a whole new level of interactivity with this application for iPhone and iPod Touch! \n\nUtilizing GPS tracking [iPhone only], your location is scanned and immediately lists the closest Hidden Mickeys to you. If you’re not in the parks, or if you’d rather scroll through the different locations, you are able to browse categorized lists of each Hidden Mickey location. Keep track of which Mickey’s you find with an easy to use built-in scoring system. Keep in mind – this is a scavenger hunt! The score counts if you want it to, so do your best and try to use the least amount of hints as possible.\n\nWhether you’re playing solo or with the whole family, you are able to keep separate user profiles to keep track of everyone’s progress. Spanning all four parks and documenting over 1200 Hidden Mickeys, this application will add a whole new level of entertainment to your trips to Disney World!\n\nIn this application you'll discover well over 1200 Hidden Mickeys throughout various locations at the Walt Disney World Resort including:\n• Magic Kingdom Park \n• Epcot\n• Disney's Hollywood Studios\n• Disney’s Animal Kingdom\n• Blizzard Beach & Typhoon Lagoon Water Parks\n• Disney Springs\n• EPSN Wide World of Sports\n• Miniature Golf Courses\n• Over 20 DIFFERENT Disney Hotels\n\nPLUS: tips, hints and author Steven Barrett's very own favorite Hidden Mickeys. We've also included the use of Game Center, which allows you gain achievements while playing! We've even hidden a few of these that can only unlock from certain places inside the park - can you get them all?\n\nTrue to their name, Hidden Mickeys are elusive. New ones appear from time to time and some old ones disappear. When that happens — and it will — Steve will let you know on his web site: www.HiddenMickeysGuide.com. Periodically, the application will be updated to reflect these changes, becoming your best source for all things Hidden Mickeys!\n\n“Hidden Mickeys” is based off of the newest and most comprehensive edition of the book. “Hidden Mickeys – A Field Guide to Walt Disney World's Best Kept Secrets” 8th edition can be found for sale throughout Disney World, in stores, or online at Amazon.com."

This app shows how much lower three tires on your van or RV are than the highest tire, the reference tire.  These values can be used for re-parking or for choosing leveling block heights.  Leveling biases can also be entered into the app, so you can make the sink drain work better or ensure your head is higher than your feet when sleeping.\n\nSounds can be used to level your van with this app.  You can set a level tolerance value and chose a sound pair.  One sound will be played if you are out of the level tolerance range.  Another sound will play if you are within the tolerance level.  For example: You can choose a level tolerance of 2 inches.  Then make sure the audible icon on the upper left of the main display is activated and put your phone on a flat surface.  Get in the driver's seat and start moving your vehicle.  The app will tell you when you are out of and within the 2 inch level tolerance limit.  \n\nThe SprinterLevel app also has a 'Gear Left Outside' GPS alarming feature.  If you put stuff, or plan to put stuff, outside your van or RV ... you can use arm this alarm as a reminder in case you drive away and leave your leveling blocks, or generator, or mountain bike, etc.  Once the alarm is armed, the app will run in the background.  When the app sees that you have traveled past a selected alarm distance, it will play an audible alarm and send a local notification to the phone.\n\nThree distances are available for the GPS alarming \"geo-fence\".  These distances allow you to arm the alarm and then walk around your campsite without setting the alarm off.\n\nSprinterLevel will quickly pay for itself it it means you don't drive away from your $1000 generator or a $2500 mountain bike!\n\nSprinterLevel is a standalone app.  No connection to the Internet is needed."

No hidden costs.\n\nNow in their 11th year as a mobile app, and their 13th online, the Wise Pilgrim Guides are the go-to source of up-to-date information on the Camino de Santiago.\n\nThe app is updated regularly with new content and new features and offers you the ability to leave tips for pilgrims following behind you.\n\nThis guide covers the Camino del Norte from Irún to Santiago de Compostela and includes all of the alternate routes along the way. It has been redesigned and now works almost exclusively offline (to share your comments with others will require a data connection).  As more an more albergues share their WiFi this becomes less of an issue, and the guide will tell you which ones offer WiFi.\n\nAccommodation Directory:  \nA full directory of Albergues, camping, hotels, pensions, paradors, and cases rurales.  Over 500 in total, with special attention to those that can be booked online.\n\nStageless Guide:\nNo more \"stage anxiety\" or guide created bottlenecks.\n\nMaps:  \nOffline and online versions of a beautiful topographical may will give you a good view of the terrain ahead.\n\nPhotos: \nPhotos of albergues, monuments and other points of interest along the way.  Currently 400+ images and growing.\n\nScrollable Elevation Map:  \nThis one is hard to show with just a screenshot, but the elevation that appears at the top of every city page scrolls East to West.  One complete elevation, from Irún to Santiago, uninterrupted by page folds.\n\nComments:  \nAlbergue closed early for the season?  Have a restaurant that you want to share, or perhaps one to warn others about?  Every location in the app gives you the opportunity to leave a comment and to read the comments left by others. No registration necessary.\n\n¡Buen Camino and thank you for your support!"

This rugged, exhilarating walk is filled with stunning scenery, amazing ruins of ancient civilizations, incredibly friendly people, pristine beaches, delicious food, and more.\n\nIt includes an in-depth reference 'Trekopedia' (communities, pensions / hotels, attractions, services, points of interest, etc.), supports customizable routes, interactive maps (including detailed offline maps), directions and section-by-section guide, dynamic trip stats for your current section, stage, and route, an intelligent compass that shows the right direction based on your current location and chosen route, and more.\n\n--- Trekopedia ---\nTrekRight’s ‘Lycian Way Encyclopedia’ is packed with extensive reference information, organized into Communities, Accommodation, Attractions, Services, Points of Interest, Route Sections, and Articles. Everything can be searched and filtered, viewed on a map, notes can be added (anything from a simple reservation number to a copy-and-pasted blurb from a website), and more. \n\n--- Interactive Offline Maps ---\nTrekRight has detailed *offline* map imagery showing your current location on your selected route along with pins showing all the locations included in the Trekopedia (just touch a pin to open its related Trekopedia entry). Our offline maps mean you don’t require Internet access to use the mapping functionality. Online maps are also available for when you have an Internet connection. Easily filter and do searches. Scroll, zoom, and rotate the map. Completely transform how you ‘see’ your surroundings on the Lycian Way.\n\n--- Intelligent Compass ---\nIn addition to all the standard compass functionality, TrekRight’s intelligent compass also points you in the right direction based on your current location and your selected route, and updates dynamically as you move. Never get lost again!\n\n--- Pre-Departure Planning & Preparation ---\nTrekRight makes it easy to plan your route (including configuring the sections you want to follow), organize it into stages, and review distances and elevations (including a handy interactive Elevation Profile Chart). Comes pre-defined with popular routes (full and partial). Review and rank hotels / pensions, flag locations of interest as ‘favorites’, add your own notes, and more. \n\n--- Up-To-Date Content ---\nTrekRight’s content is regularly updated and expanded based on the latest information available to us. You can check for content updates directly inside TrekRight and download our database whenever it is convenient for you (even on the trail), without having to connect to the App Store. Always be up to date!\n\n--- No Internet Connection Required ---\nAll of TrekRight's content is stored directly on your phone, including our detailed offline maps. No Internet connection is required unless you want to use the online maps."

      "label": "TV Towers USA is a map of digital TV broadcasting towers in the United States and its territories plus a select number of Canadian stations. The database includes over 2000 stations and over 1000 repeaters. My users include avid RVers who roam from region to region and need to locate available TV networks, and homeowners setting up a new antenna system. \n\nApple Watch (Series 5) users can make use of their compass with the optional in-app purchase of an embedded watch app. \n \nThere is an alternate compass tab which shows the direction of stations within a 45 mile radius—given enough screen space—just look over your phone to see which way to point your antenna.\n\nPinch to zoom into your locality, or hit the circular location button to concentrate on local stations. If more than 80 stations are in the area being viewed, a random assortment of 80 stations will be displayed.\n\nThere is no \"phoning home\" with data, personal or not.  If a data connection is available, the FCC servers will be asked for contour plot data when a tower is selected. This will show up as a blue overlay showing the calculated area over which the signal will drop off by at most 35 dBu. Basically, this is the area where an antenna not too near the ground has a chance to receive the signal; your luck will vary. Once downloaded, the data is stored for the next time you select the tower.\n\nErrors and omissions are to be expected especially for stations with low power licenses. Please e-mail the support address if you find a glaring omission or error; I'll need a call sign and a TV network."

In map view, you can tap any wifi icon where wireless information is available, and use the button to copy the password to the clipboard. The map is available offline so you don’t need an Internet connection to use WiFox when you’re traveling.\n\n*Click Copy to easily paste passwords into wireless network settings.\n\n*Users can also add passwords they find from airports around the world. Those passwords are then sent to foXnoMad for verification and approval before they are added to the map.\n\n*In ‘List View’ you can update passwords for airports already added (when you’ve noticed some changes). As you travel you can also rate the wireless hotspot information to let us know if the details worked for you or not. Based on traveler feedback, the connection information is updated, verified, or removed.\n\n*WiFox icons indicate how fresh, reliable, and highly rated a given airport wireless network’s information is.\n\n*WiFox is updated continuously with information travelers, pilots, and other users send through the WiFox app, foXnoMad website, and foXnoMad Facebook and Twitter accounts. WiFox currently has wireless Internet information for over 700 airports around the world.\n\n*The map is updated automatically upon opening the app (when you have Internet access) or by clicking the ‘Update’ button on the map or refresh icon on the List View.\n\n*WiFox also protects users on free (open) wifi networks by telling you the proper network name, so you don't unintentionally connect to a rogue or malicious access point.\n\nWiFox Premium subscriptions unlock the following features:\n\n* Automatic notifications of the highest rated password, with network connection information, as soon as you land. WiFox Premium detects the airport you're at and displays the most relevant wifi network name and password so you can get online as soon as you step off the plane.\n\n* View password ratings to see which passwords work best throughout an airport so you can connect to the strongest and most reliable connection.\n\n* Be able to add your own password ratings within WiFox. Premium user priority ratings ensure the best wifi passwords are always displayed.\n\nAfter a 30-day free trial period a $24.99/year purchase will be applied to your iTunes account following confirmation of a Premium upgrade. Subscriptions will automatically renew unless canceled within 24-hours before the end of the current period. You can cancel anytime with your iTunes account settings. Any unused portion of a free trial will be forfeited if you purchase a subscription.

All updates are free.\n\nNow in their 11th year as a mobile app, and their 13th online, the Wise Pilgrim Guides are the go-to source of up-to-date information on the Camino de Santiago.\n\nThe app is updated regularly with new content and new features and offers you the ability to leave tips for pilgrims following behind you.\n\nThis guide covers the Camino Portugués and its three most common variations; the Central Route, the Coastal Route, and the Variante Espiritual. It has been redesigned and now works almost exclusively offline (to share your comments with others will require a data connection).  As more an more albergues share their WiFi this becomes less of an issue, and the guide will tell you which ones offer WiFi.\n\nAccommodation Directory:  \nA full directory of Albergues, camping, hotels, pensions, paradors, and cases rurales.  Over 400 in total, with special attention to those that can be booked online.\n\nStageless Guide:\nNo more \"stage anxiety\" or guide created bottlenecks.\n\nMaps:  \nOffline and online versions of a beautiful topographical may will give you a good view of the terrain ahead.\n\nPhotos: \nPhotos of albergues, monuments and other points of interest along the way.  Currently 400+ images and growing.\n\nScrollable Elevation Map:  \nThis one is hard to show with just a screenshot, but the elevation that appears at the top of every city page scrolls East to West.  One complete elevation, from St. Jean Pied de Port to Santiago, uninterrupted by page folds.\n\nComments:  \nAlbergue closed early for the season?  Have a restaurant that you want to share, or perhaps one to warn others about?  Every location in the app gives you the opportunity to leave a comment and to read the comments left by others. No registration necessary.\n\n¡Buen Camino and thank you for your support!"

      "label": "Where's the closest RV Dump station at a campground, a rest area, a truck stop, a water treatment plant?\n\nRV Dumps knows these things. And you can easily know too. This same data is part of the \"Camp and RV\" app which has a dump station filter in it.\n\nRV Dumps checks your location and displays up to 150 points on a map view. You can filter by type to see only what you want to see on the map and zoom out. You can also use the offline manual lookup to find locations by type, state and city...even when you have no phone service!\n\nRV Dumps takes the database from the top ranked camping app called Camp & RV and filters all points that have a dump station as an amenity (not \"hookups\" which are at a site. Many parks no longer have stand alone stations.) Maybe you need one and a night stop or you are just passing on through. From Rest Areas to truck stops to private campgrounds (either stay the night or call to see if you can pay a separate fee). From State Parks to even some National Park and Forest campgrounds that have one.\n\nDump stations are being paved over left and right these days. We removed several each day that are found to be closed. Please send in reports and adds. I have hundreds more dump locations that I don't have GPS points for so they can't be placed in the mobile app yet. I keep working on those.\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Search for specific locations around you on a map.\n- One-touch calling for places that have a phone number listed. Good idea to call and ask about the fees as Flying J now charges for it.\n- One-touch turn-by-turn directions for all POIs.\n- Works when iPhone has no phone service.\n- Supports a manual lookup mode where users can look up parks and truck stops that have RV dumps.\n\nUpdates make major changes that early app reviews won't reflect. We added thousands of places like waste water treatment plants, dealerships, gas stations, public places, storage places and stores."

      "label": "MapCred lets you see where in the world you spend your time, whether it's a neighborhood stroll, a trip to the store, a road trip, or an international vacation. The more time you spend in a location, the \"hotter\" it looks in your heat map. Learn more about your own daily travel habits. Show off your worldly travels. Compare scores with friends via integrated Game Center leaderboards. Don't just unlock new places; revel in your mastery of your own favorite haunts. Be king of your block. Queen of QFC. Prince of Popeye's.\n\n● VISUALIZE YOUR TRAVELS, BIG AND SMALL\n\nMapCred captures your daily travels automatically and puts them in vivid colors on your personal map. Passing through an area makes it blue. Pausing for a minute in that spot turns it green. Stay put for a cup of coffee or a nice meal and you'll gain yellow territory. Spend more than an hour in an area and it goes red to demonstrate your mastery.\n\n● BEAUTIFUL MAPS, BEAUTIFUL LIFE\n\nGorgeous high-resolution maps of the world serve as the canvas for your own personal heat map. Want to take the path less traveled? Visit an interesting shop along your daily commute? Explore new neighborhoods? MapCred empowers you to wander like a pro. There's no wrong answer!\n\n● FULLY AUTOMATED\n\nMapCred runs efficiently in the background to build your personal map while you go about your daily business. The app uses geofencing and intelligent backoff to preserve battery life while journaling your movements around planet Earth down to an incredible 1 meter resolution! On the off chance iOS decides to close the app, MapCred will send you a notification reminding you to launch again.\n\n● GAME CENTER LEADERBOARDS\n\nIf you're feeling competitive, optionally compare your high scores with friends via Game Center, Apple's built-in gaming hub. See who's got the most Blue, Green, Yellow, and Red territory. Earn cred with your map mastery.\n\n● IMPORT FROM FOG OF WORLD\n\nFog of World users can seamlessly import their progress into MapCred anytime and continue where they left off. So it's easy to join the MapCred community as a seasoned traveler. If you change your mind, you can always undo previous imports while preserving your natively-journaled trips.\n\n● OPEN DATA FORMAT\n\nYour travels belong to you. Export all your journaled and imported data anytime, as often as you want. MapCred can export in industry-standard GPX format as well as simple CSV text files. Switch apps anytime without losing progress. \n\n● PRIVATE AND SECURE\n\nYour personal map is yours and only yours. All location data is stored locally on your iPhone or iPad only. Nothing is sent to us (heck, we don't even have servers). Don't worry; if you choose to use Game Center, only your score is shared; not your location.\n\nMapCred uses your location in the background to update your personal map, even when you're doing other things with your phone. As you move around the world or spend time at a restaurant, business, or home, MapCred journals your progress so you can gain points and visualize your day later on. Your location is only used by the app locally on your phone; it is never transmitted off your phone to us or anyone else.\n\nMapCred uses notifications for only one purpose: To let you know if the app stopped running in the background, so you can restart it and not lose any progress. We will never push a notification for any other purpose. \n\n● WHY MAPCRED?\n\nWe're huge fans of mapping apps such as Fog of World and Strut. If you haven't tried them, please do. This is a different take on the \"uncover the world\" model. When you're traveling the world, those apps are lots of fun. You can show off your stuff. But when you're out getting groceries, or getting a car wash, or going for a jog, you might also want to feel like you're getting a little cred. MapCred is for people like us. Whether you're watering your lawn or visiting the Taj Mahal, MapCred will make you feel like you're a winner. \n\nAlso, it's way cheaper."

      "label": "We are happy to offer the 2017 edition of Denver E-70 of the Whizkeys Tollroads as a free update for all our paid users! This version includes all the latest Plate and ExpressToll rate update. Please rate us highly to keep us motivated to keep this app updated and add more features!\n\nWe present the Whizkeys Tollroads edition of Denver's E-470, one of the most expensive tollroads in the US. Did you know that the tolls on E-470 are as high as about 3 miles to a dollar? That translates to about 3 times you pay for gas for the same mileage! No wonder E-470 is known to have only Beemers and Mercedes and Land Rovers driving it - only they can afford this kind of toll!\n\nHere is an app that will help you manage this toll road for the few occasions you have to use it. Find out how much toll you will pay using a simple intuitive interface. Then explore the road and see exactly where all the exits and toll plazas are, so maybe you can plan a route better (remember, you pay big bucks every time you go through a toll plaza!).\n\nKey features: \n1. Complete toll rate information for all plaza combinations for all classes of vehicles, available fully offline \n2. One glance information on distance from every toll and service plaza \n3. Information on amenities available in service plazas \n4. Map showing all plazas, distances and bearings \n5. Tap on your location to get instant feedback on next toll and service plazas \n6. Find out how much you will save by avoiding toll between frequently used plazas \n7. Find out how much you save using Electronic toll (ExpressToll) over License Plate tolling \n8. Full support for iPad/iPod (wifi-only devices may not give you very accurate location) \n9. And more... just explore! \n10. All this for 99c! \n\nKey benefits: \nThis app WILL SAVE YOU MONEY! Remember avoiding a toll road does not always save money because you may spend more on gas. This app will tell you exactly how much you will save by taking into account the extra distance you will travel. You will potentially save many times the price of this app in just one trip!\n\nAnd, if you have a few extra minutes, see how you can avoid E-470 altogether using a single click of a button and explore alternative routes. All the information right in your fingertips, and most of it available without even any Internet connection! \n\nIf we save you on tolls even once, that pays for the app! For under a buck, you cannot go wrong!\n\nPlease send those feedbacks coming, and above all, be safe while driving."

      "label": "Whether this is your first visit, or you live here, we invite you to discover the Napa Valley in a FUN, informative, efficient, and highly cost-effective way. For the price of a couple of coffees, everyone in your car will explore one of the great wine regions of the world with total flexibility on when and where to stop. We do NOT accept compensation from anyone to direct you, and there are no upselling or pop-ups\n\nOur professional narrator's resume includes being the voice of multiple characters in a Pixar production. Narration is automatically triggered by GPS as you drive along and can be played on your cell phone speaker, car speakers using Bluetooth, or speaker that connects to your cell phone. We'll share a few ideas and suggestions on where to stop, but it's your tour and entirely up to you. It's like having a highly knowledgeable tour guide in the backseat but without the expense or time pressure. We'll have you laughing and learning as we share dozens of facts, insights, and stories about the Napa Valley. \n\n+Learn about a 4'11” tall immigrant who became a giant in the field of wine-making. \n+Find out which family winery has had their wines served in the White House under 3 different administrations. \n+Find out why George Yount adopted a 3-year old Native American and about a remarkable daily threat they faced. \n+Discover where and when the first woman winemaker, a single mom, had her winery built. \n+Learn why and how people from Napa started their own country (yep…it happened). \n+Hear why Elvis fled his motel to sleep at a location we'll point out. \n+Find out why coffins were regularly taken to the train station by the same “mourners”.\n+Learn why there were 120 wineries here in 1889, but fewer than 20 in 1968\n+ Gain an understanding of how the Napa Valley grew to over 400 wineries and 1000 brands. \n+ Plus far more! \n\nWritten by a married couple who so appreciated a similar kind of tour app they bought while vacationing in a national park, they decided to create one of their own for Napa Valley, where they live. They sought out a wide range of authors, people in the wine business, and other resources in order to bring you the valley in a unique way.  In addition to the fun narration, you'll find photos and additional written tips, facts, insights, and stories within the app for your enjoyment. \n\nNarration is automatically played from a starting place not far from downtown Napa (the city), and continues as you drive along St. Helena Highway (29) to Calistoga, and then back to the city of the Napa along Silverado Trail (about 60 miles). It can add lots of value whether you use it for an hour, a day, or over multiple days. Download when you have access to WiFi to avoid any cell-data charges. You do NOT use cell data as you drive along. The narration can be played manually too, so you can hear it anytime from anywhere. \n\nIf you have already invested in quality (GPS-triggered) narration tours, you know. But if you have not yet been on one, please know that there are some great tours offered by various reputable companies around the world. You might find like we did, that it's your favorite way to travel! \n\nWe'd love to hear from you after your Napa Valley tour!"

Listen carefully for distant footsteps, eerie moaning, and maybe even a ghostly dog's nails clacking on the wood floor.\n\nThis narrated walking tour of historic Charleston is 1.7 miles long and stops at 11 haunted sites. Too spooked? Rain? Take a break and resume the tour later. It's like having your own personal guide, at a fraction of the price. \n\nTwo Buck Tours allow you to tour on your terms: go when you want, with whom you want. All tours have maps with GPS, photos, text, and audio narration (in English). Good for all ages. No schedules, no crowds, no worries!"

      "label": "Because some things change when you cross the line... \n\nCompiled after over 12+ years of full time RV road-tripping across the USA, State Lines is an indispensable traveler’s guide to highly variable state laws and regulations. \n\nCurrently State Lines tracks over 55 pieces of travel relevant information for each of the 50 states; including cell phone & texting bans, seat belt & child safety seats, state sales tax exemptions, gas/diesel taxes, bottle deposits, time zones, towing & RV specific laws, rest area overnight parking limits, state park camping entrance fees, default speed limits, radar detectors, highway emergency #s, alcohol sales laws & taxes, smoking bans, open container laws, pet leash laws, bicycle helmet laws, motorcycle laws (helmet, lights, eye protection & lane sharing), left turns on red, u-turns, keep right and more. \n\nState Lines is location aware, so it can automatically show you information about nearby states. The entire State Lines database is integrated into the application, so State Lines works when you are out of cellular or Wi-Fi coverage. \n\nWhen you visit a new state, have you ever wondered: \n\nWhat restraints for my kids are required in this state? \nIs the sales tax lower over the next state line? \nIs the fuel tax cheaper here? \nCan I buy beer in the grocery stores?\nCan I overnight in rest areas? \nIs smoking allowed in restaurants? \nAre radar detectors legal? \nCan I make a left turn on red? \nAre helmets & eye protection required? \n\n\nKEY FEATURES:\n+ Quick Compare: You can pick up to three favorite data fields to be displayed on the main screen, making it easy to compare nearby states.\n\n+ Custom Sorting: You can sort the state list alphabetically, by distance from you, and by your selected Quick Compare fields. If you’ve ever wanted to see what state has the lowest alcohol or fuel taxes, this feature makes it easy!\n\n+ Custom Page Ordering: State Lines has seven pages of detailed information per state. You can rearrange these pages so that your favorite pages are first.\n\n\nState Lines is an essential application for anyone traveling around the United States - whether by RV, car, train, bike, plane, or boat. No matter how you travel, if you’re frequently crossing state lines, you need State Lines. \n\nState Lines is a growing project - by travelers for travelers - and we welcome feedback on ideas for other useful state specific information to include in future versions. Please let us know what else you would like us to track! \n\n****** NOTES  *******\n\nState Lines is intended to provide an at-a-glance summarized guide to rules and regulations, and it is not an exhaustive legal reference. While every effort has been made to provide quality up to date data, no warranty for accuracy of data is expressed or implied. State Lines assumes no responsibility for how you utilize the data. Keep in mind, local regulations can often override state level rules (so while a state may not have a cell phone ban, a city may - which will not be reflected in State Lines), and laws frequently change. Always verify with the proper authorities before assuming anything. \n\nGun Laws: Please note, State Lines has not included this feature in a long time. We recommend apps like 'Legal Heat' - which is updated regularly by the experts on this very complex topic. \n\nWe will be keeping State Lines up to date with periodic updates. This is a time consuming manual research process, and we appreciate your patience and understanding if things get out of date. \n\nYou can help though - if you do discover any out-of-date information in State Lines, please contact us at statelines@technomadia.com. Thanks!"

      "label": "There are 140+ audio points that play automatically along the scenic drive, featuring the best things to see and do, stories, tips and driving directions.  \n\nProfessional tour guides share advice on how to prioritize your time at recommended “not to be missed” viewpoints, suggested side-trips and places of interest.\n\nTours work offline, using free GPS signal and location services, so no data roaming, network, or wifi is required while touring.\n\nVisit www.gypsyguide.com for route maps, sample audio, tips and advice and what to know before you go.\n\nIt’s Just Like Having a Tour Guide in Your Car™\n\nWHAT TO EXPECT:  \nThe Road to Hana is one of the world’s most scenic drives and a popular sightseeing activity to see Maui’s spectacular waterfalls, black sand beaches, bamboo forests, lava rock formations and amazing ocean views as you wind your way through 620 curves and 59 bridges.\n\nIf you prefer travelling independently, at your own pace, GyPSy Guide provides the best Road to Hana tour experience, along with the freedom to choose what you enjoy; squishing the black sand between your toes at Wai’anapanapa, hiking the Pipiwai Bamboo Trail, or maybe time to enjoy an extra slice of banana bread.\n\nYou can’t help but cheer on the world class windsurfers at Ho’okipa.  And you won’t need to worry about photoshopping the Rainbow Eucalyptus at the Ke’anae Arboretum or the stunning contrast between blue water and black lava rock at Ke’anae Peninsular.\n\nTake a moment to cool off with a quick swim at the pristine Hamoa Beach and see where Haleakala National Park descends from the summit to the sea and the “Seven Sacred Pools” of Oheo at the end of the drive.\n\nWith such a long day of exploring (expect 8-12 hours), it’s important to know the 5 “not to be missed” stops, and the many more suggestions if you have time.  Part of the secret to enjoying the journey is knowing how not to waste your time, and we have tips for that as well.\n\nOn the return drive from Hana, we’ll point out the not to be missed stops again as well as tell you stories about Hawaii’s fascinating history and rich culture.\n\nPlease note Highway #31 ‘backside route’ is not recommended for driving. Rental car insurance void.   Road can be closed for repairs, mudslides and flash floods.\n  \nWHAT YOU’LL SEE:\n\nSome of the highlights along the route include;\n\n•\tHo’okipa Beach Park\n•\tPaia\n•\tKe’anae Peninsular\n•\tWai’anapanapa Park, Black Sand Beach\n•\tHana\n•\tHamoa Beach\n•\tWailua Falls\n•\tTwin Falls\n•\tUpper Waikanai Falls (3 Bears)\n•\tPools of O’heo (Seven Sacred Pools)\n•\tPipiwai Bamboo Trail\n\n**Reservations to visit Wai'anapanapa State Park and black sand beach are now mandatory** \n\n\nBATTERY USAGE:\n++  Continued use of GPS/Location Services in the background increases battery usage.  We strongly recommend taking a cigarette style (DC outlet) car charger.  Avoid using a direct connection to the USB port of a rental vehicle.\n\nIPADS:\n** iPad models must include a GPS chip. Please note that Apple only install these on the iPad Wifi + Cellular models.  Wifi only iPad models have limited location service capabilities and are unable to play commentary automatically.\n\nDOWNLOADING:\nThe apps are larger in size in order to work offline.  You must be on wifi to download as the store may block the download over cellular networks.  \n\nABOUT US:\n\nGyPSy Guide™ produce award winning narrated audio tours along scenic drives and road trips around the world.  \n\nEnjoyed by travelers who prefer to set their own pace and itinerary on vacation, but enjoy a fun, informative and educational guided experience while driving themselves.  \n\nOur goal is to provide a great introduction to the region and inspire you to learn more and return.  \n\nNone of our apps include paid advertising or placements for benefit"

Get Airborne.\n\nOr access LOCAL INFO--before you depart, just after arrival--anytime. \n\nMilSpaceA app allows authorized U.S. government users to register for Department of Defense (DoD) military space-available travel. It is the exclusive app for all DoD travelers wanting a quick, easy, reliable, and authorized means to sign up for Space-A at primary departure terminals. \n\nVISITING FAMILY MEMBERS and TDY military & contractors are now using MilSpaceA app as well--there's MUCH MORE here than just space-a signup.\n\nExpanded LOCAL INFO: billeting, car rental, dining, Exchange info, links to air terminals' pages, USOs, & more.\nAIRCRAFT GALLERY: depictions & basic descriptions of DoD pax aircraft\nTRAVEL ADVISORIES - announcements of temporary conditions affecting space-a\nSIGNUP ARCHIVE - stored in-app (as well as in user's own e-mail \"Sent\" items)\nFOREIGN CURRENCY - daily exchange rates for AOIs\nDOCUMENT LIBRARY:  key space-a documents:  policy, guides, handbooks, AMCGrams\nENHANCED ONLINE MAPPING: Your location shown relative to points of interest in the app (requires active geolocation & Internet access). \n\nFirst, browse through \"Airfields of Interest\".  Call ahead to various terminals (call-enabled for iPhone) or visit terminals’ flight schedule pages (if they have them--most don't). Then fill in your details, select departure airfields and destination countries, and send out the signup to register for travel. Some terminals will reply; most will not. Just keep a copy of e-mail(s) as proof of signup.\n\n• Remote space-a signup for multiple airfields. Prepare off- or online--then transmit when you have connectivity.\n• Multi-branch terminal support (Air Force, Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, Guard & Reserve)\n• Complies with Air Mobility Command rules: Signups generated by you, your e-mail as the sender & reply-to address. Copies saved directly in your e-mail Sent items, retrievable anytime.\n• Data privacy: No SSAN required. Exclusive AMC-authorized Pseudo Person ID (PPID) auto-created. (Some Navy locations still insist on SSANs--contact them directly after signup to pass SSAN).  \n• NEW: Now includes optional fields for DoD ID numbers, dates of birth, and passport info.\n• Full control of your data--ability to purge anytime.\n\n***\n\"My mom came to visit me and she used the app, too (...) It's great for anyone visiting [the base].\" - LT\n\"Amazing how easy this app made our trip. This and our books together, because weird or not, I still like the smell of paper\" - JD\n\"Great app. Very easy to use\" - TT\n***\n\nPolicies governing space-a are implemented in DoD Directive 4515.13-R (Air Transportation Eligibility) and AMCI 24-101 Vol 14. Determine your eligibility before registering for travel. CONTACT YOUR LOCAL TERMINAL if you have any questions of eligibility. Refer to http://www.amc.af.mil/amctravel for current official AMC policy. Utilize and support pepperd.com, spacea.net & takeahop.org for unofficial discussions, info, and desktop-based space-a signup.\n\nOnly after mission requirements are met will remaining seats be offered up for space-a. Be prepared for delays or short-notice diversions. Space-A is a privilege, not a right--movement is never guaranteed. UNDERSTAND THE BASICS OF SPACE-A before signing up.\n\nMore about Take-a-Hop--and its MilSpaceA app)\n\nSince inception, Take-a-Hop's platform has generated MILLIONS of space-a signups. Trusted by passengers and passenger service agents (PSAs) alike. Used by tens of thousands of DoD travelers. Solely managed by a USAF veteran who has also traveled military space-a and knows what travelers are up against. MilSpaceA app is not endorsed by the US Federal Government, DoD, or any branch thereof. And still, it's the name recommended by thousands and earning your trust for years.\n\nThanks and Happy Travels!\n\nWEB at www.takeahop.com/app\nLIKE on www.facebook.com/takeahop"

Use the \"Layers\" icon to select which agencies you want displayed to create your own custom map. (Hint, the toggles are color coded to the color each layer is displayed in.)\n\n- Links are provided to each agency's website within the app, so that you can further your research as to what land use rules apply for each public land type - such as permits, fees, activities allowed, and limits of stay.\n\n- Map layers are stored on device - no internet connection required.\n\n- Be sure to turn on the 'Basic' base map to see the US Public Land labels for each land area. This base map layer is also stored entirely on your device, and can be utilized if you do not have an internet connection or would like to conserve bandwidth. \n\n- If you have an internet connection (or have cached them before going out of signal), you can utilize the built in Apple Maps and satellite view maps as the base layer underneath the public land overlays.\n\n- A boondocker's assistant - While US Public Lands is not specifically a camp site locator and does not have a database of specific sites, by turning on the satellite view map, you can better scout out trails, roads and signs of dispersed camping locations within the boundaries of the public land resources. \n\n- Quickly toggle between 'Show' and 'Hide' via the \"Map\" icon to more clearly see satellite images below.\n\n- If you have GPS access on your device, click the 'Locate Me' icon to show your present location - know what type of land you're on right now!\n\n- Built in search tool locates anything on device maps supports (requires internet access) - including cities, states, zip codes, addresses and points of interest. A pin is dropped at the search location.\n\n\nThank you to the Protected Area Database (PAD-US) of the U.S. Geological Survey for providing the public domain raw map data that we’ve been able to utilize to create this interactive overlayable mapping & navigation tool. We will update our maps in the future to stay in sync with improvements to this data set. \n\nPlease note, the USGS PAD-US database contains the “most up-to-date aggregation of Federal lands and waters” available, but this database is still evolving and some locations may not be listed and others may not have precisely accurate boundaries. Resolution across the nation may vary. And always remember - there may be private unmapped inholdings within any public lands - so always pay attention to local signage, indications, and information. \n\nThe US Public Lands app should only be used as an overview, and you should always confirm more precise details by consulting local field offices, administration websites, and other resources. Do not solely rely on this app for determining if you are on public or private land."

This makes it much easier to find RV dump stations along a route you've created in another app such as Road Trip Planner.\n- Send a dump station location to our app Road Trip Planner.  This helps in routing your travels (requires separate purchase of the Road Trip Planner app).\n\nWe want to expand our RV dump station database as much as possible, so we have made it easy for you to easily submit a new RV dump station - simply tap the + button below the map.  To correct or update dump station information, tap “Location Comment” in the detail view. We will be updating the database often.\n\nDue to the nature of dump stations constantly changing their status it's recommended you contact the dump station prior to using it to verify its existence."

      "label": "Where's the closest RV Dump station at a campground, a rest area, a truck stop, a water treatment plant?\n\nRV Dumps knows these things. And you can easily know too. This same data is part of the \"Camp and RV\" app which has a dump station filter in it.\n\nRV Dumps checks your location and displays up to 150 points on a map view. You can filter by type to see only what you want to see on the map and zoom out. You can also use the offline manual lookup to find locations by type, state and city...even when you have no phone service!\n\nRV Dumps takes the database from the top ranked camping app called Camp & RV and filters all points that have a dump station as an amenity (not \"hookups\" which are at a site. Many parks no longer have stand alone stations.) Maybe you need one and a night stop or you are just passing on through. From Rest Areas to truck stops to private campgrounds (either stay the night or call to see if you can pay a separate fee). From State Parks to even some National Park and Forest campgrounds that have one.\n\nDump stations are being paved over left and right these days. We removed several each day that are found to be closed. Please send in reports and adds. I have hundreds more dump locations that I don't have GPS points for so they can't be placed in the mobile app yet. I keep working on those.\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Search for specific locations around you on a map.\n- One-touch calling for places that have a phone number listed. Good idea to call and ask about the fees as Flying J now charges for it.\n- One-touch turn-by-turn directions for all POIs.\n- Works when iPhone has no phone service.\n- Supports a manual lookup mode where users can look up parks and truck stops that have RV dumps.\n\nUpdates make major changes that early app reviews won't reflect. We added thousands of places like waste water treatment plants, dealerships, gas stations, public places, storage places and stores."

My users include avid RVers who roam from region to region and need to locate available TV networks, and homeowners setting up a new antenna system. \n\nApple Watch (Series 5) users can make use of their compass with the optional in-app purchase of an embedded watch app. \n \nThere is an alternate compass tab which shows the direction of stations within a 45 mile radius—given enough screen space—just look over your phone to see which way to point your antenna.\n\nPinch to zoom into your locality, or hit the circular location button to concentrate on local stations. If more than 80 stations are in the area being viewed, a random assortment of 80 stations will be displayed.\n\nThere is no \"phoning home\" with data, personal or not.  If a data connection is available, the FCC servers will be asked for contour plot data when a tower is selected. This will show up as a blue overlay showing the calculated area over which the signal will drop off by at most 35 dBu. Basically, this is the area where an antenna not too near the ground has a chance to receive the signal; your luck will vary. Once downloaded, the data is stored for the next time you select the tower.\n\nErrors and omissions are to be expected especially for stations with low power licenses. Please e-mail the support address if you find a glaring omission or error; I'll need a call sign and a TV network."

In cities like New York where you have to swipe your transit card to unlock the turnstile, forgetting your balance and being greeted by an \"insufficient funds\" message can be annoying, and delay your journey.\n\nMetroBuddy lets you enter your current MetroCard balance, and update it each time you swipe. Never lose time at the MetroCard reader again, your balance will always be available on your phone! The app also calculates how many rides you have left, based on your fare. Use the History tab to review the changes you made to your balance.\n\nMetroBuddy also provides Siri shortcuts to record a swipe and check your balance. This enables you to build powerful automation for your commute, such as recording a swipe, starting your favorite playlist, and checking the next train departure.\n\nIf you are using iOS 14 or later, you can add a widget to your home screen or your widget center to view your balance even faster.\n\nWe are proud to be working on making MetroBuddy as inclusive as possible. You can change your fare if you have a more affordable one. The app is also fully compatible with iOS assistive technologies such as VoiceOver, Dynamic Type, and VoiceControl. Turnstiles are not fully accessible, but MetroBuddy is.\n\nDo not hesitate to reach out with feedback and/or questions by e-mail at hi@alexisonline.dev.\n\nPlease note that MetroBuddy is a hobby app and is not affiliated with New York's MTA in any way."

Use the digital crown to zoom in on a busy LAX or watch aircraft taking off and landing at JFK.\n\nAircraft Details\nSimply tap on an aircraft to see all its details: flight name, registration, type, category, operator, altitude, speeds and more (depending on data availability).\n\nAircraft Following\nInterested in a single aircraft? Follow it as it proceeds among the other traffic. Just tap the small blue dot to exit follow mode and return to the main map.\n\nMultiple Filters\nJust want to see aircraft below 10'000 feet, Boeing 747s or only planes from a certain airline? You can filter by altitude, type, callsign or registration. Filters can be combined, too.\n\nCustomizability\nCustomize the display using many options. You only want to see helicopters and hide all small airports? You can do that and much more...\n\nComplications Support\nWith many different complications available, designed to fit into all color schemes, PlaneWatcher is always just a tap away.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.planewatcher.app/privacy.html\nTerms of Use: https://www.planewatcher.app/terms.html"

The app works with your iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad.\n\nThe powerful navigation assistance includes:\n\n* Walk routes clearly displayed on map.\n* Precise walking directions from one sight to the next.\n* `FindMe` displays your exact location and Auto Tracking displays your movement on the map (this feature is not supported by the iPod Touch and iPad wifi models).\n* Built-in compass to show you the direction.\n* Create your own walks to see the attractions you like.\n* A detailed city map which can be used independently for your other traveling needs.\n\nPlease visit our website at www.GPSmyCity.com to find city walks for over 470 cities worldwide.\n\nNote: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. This app gives you the option to turn off the GPS tracking in the background to prolong the battery life."

Fantastic coral formations and never-ending variety of aquatic life make this THE destination for snorkelers. We included what we feel are the best snorkel spots on the island and have snorkeled all but two of them. Our hope is you enjoy them as well.\n\nWe are all about the snorkeling, but the app has a whole bunch of other “things to do” while you are in Grand Cayman. Restaurants, Dive Shops, Shipwrecks and interesting places to see! We even put in where to pick up some groceries (and libations).\n\nThe App does not require any cellular data! Decide on a snorkel adventure location from the list and the App’s map will show you where they are and how to get there by simply turning on your GPS. Have fun exploring the marine life and aquatic landscape.\n\nA side benefit of our map: It makes getting around the island a breeze!\n\nYou can turn OFF cellular data because the app does not need a cellular network connection, but you can use wireless if you agree. Put it in airplane mode and turn on Wireless.  With no roaming data charge, you can save lots of money.\n\nThe App is targeted to new visitors to Cayman, but there are great benefits for even veteran Cayman devotees!\n\nOur aim is to help you find all the spots and make it easy to get to them.  With the App you can take the site listings and locations with you in one easy package.  Enjoy a snorkel spot and see what other interesting treats Cayman has to offer nearby and how easy it is to find them by using our map and your GPS.\n\nWe have not gone into great detail as to what you might see at each spot, because they all have diverse and interesting marine life and we do not want to give too much away.  The unique features of each site get mentioned, but remember, the sea is an ever changing environment so what you experience from year to year will change.\n \nCheck out the Fish ID screens. You will be able to identify some of the most common fish, and now birds, you encounter."

The tour features a selection of the historic sites in which the events of the musical occurred, from the First Bank of the United States to the location where the Reynolds Affair began. Each site is associated with relevant songs from the musical, so that you can listen to them in the site where the events referred to in the song actually happened. \n\nThe tour contains photographs of the sites, historical notes, and bonus stops (e.g. the Philadelphia Mint, National Constitution Center) for those who have more time and/or would like to deepen their knowledge of early American history. \n\n20 percent of the net proceeds from this app will be donated to The Friends of Independence National Park to support their efforts to reopen the First Bank of the United States to the public. And speaking of the First Bank, the app includes photographs of the current interior, which is otherwise impossible to see.\n\nWhether you're a tourist, teacher, student, history buff, fan of the musical, or all of the above, you're sure to enjoy this chance to connect the genius of Lin Manuel Miranda's musical to the miracle that is our country.\n\nAs featured on KYW CBS Philly: http://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2016/10/23/giving-philadelphia-its-due-in-the-life-of-alexander-hamilton/\n\nNote: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.

      "label": "The latest in the series of Whizkeys Tollroads is the busiest toll road in the United States, the Garden State Parkway, Also Route 444 and US 9. Please rate us to keep the updates and new toll roads coming!\n\nKey features:\n1. Complete toll rate information for all plaza combinations for all classes of vehicles, available fully offline\n2. One glance information on distance from every toll and service plaza\n3. Additional information on service plazas\n4. Map showing all plazas, distances, and bearings\n5. Tap on your location to get instant feedback on the next toll and service plazas\n6. Find out how much you will save by avoiding toll between frequently used plazas\n7. Find out how much you save using Electronic toll (E-ZPass)\n8. Full support for phones and tablets (iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch). Note that wifi-only devices may not give you very accurate location, and you will not be able to compute alternate routes without an active wifi connection.\n9. And more... just explore!\n10. All this for 99c!\n\nKey benefits:\nThis app WILL SAVE YOU MONEY! Remember avoiding a toll road does not always save money because you may spend more on gas. This app will tell you exactly how much you will save by taking into account the extra distance you will travel. You will potentially save many times the price of this app in just one trip!\n\nUse Whizkeys Tollroads to take the hassle out of driving US tollroads! Plan ahead and know exactly how far the next plaza and exit are while you drive, and research possible toll-avoiding routes before you drive. No more missing an exit and having to pay the extra toll!\n\nWhile navigation applications are great for finding toll-avoiding routes, they are not very helpful once you are on the toll road. We decided to build a series of apps designed for specific US toll roads to address this problem. Whizkeys TollRoads are a set of simple easy to use applications that you can use while you are traveling or while you are researching potential alternatives for toll roads. Each app gives you a fully offline quick access to the toll rates, all exit and service plaza locations, and ROI (Return On Investment) calculations to show you how much you can save if you sign up for an electronic toll card. If you have Internet access, you can quickly look at an alternative toll-avoiding route and see how much that will save you (or not) after taking into account the additional driving time and mileage!\n\nThis is the Garden State Parkways Edition of Whizkeys TollRoads, optimized to run on all mobile devices (phones and tablets). You can run it mostly offline (you may need to navigate the maps ahead of time to cache the map tiles). Please note that wifi-only devices may not get very accurate location while on the road. Please visit http://www.whizkeys.com for more information and email us at info@whizkeys.com with any questions or feedback!\n\nFinally, please drive safely and do not try to manipulate this app while actively driving. Let a passenger work with the preferences, and happy travels!"

However, there is another, darker side to Scotland, with its blood soaked and turbulent history, that pitted clan against clan, that saw Scotland ripped apart in a brutal civil war, with risings and rebellions that ended with the defeat of Bonnie Prince Charlie in 1746 at the Battle of Culloden. Scotland is crammed full of history with castles steeped in tales of ghosts, torture, dungeons, of sieges, and of betrayal.  \n\nFrom the mystical Isle of Skye to the Lowlands, this app will help guide you to some of the amazing sites of interest - from Scotland's most haunted castle, to the battlefields of Culloden, Prestonpans, Falkirk and Bannockburn. To see the oldest stone memorial to Sir William Wallace and the prison where a 5 year old French drummer boy was held.

It has been redesigned and now works almost exclusively offline (to share your comments with others will require a data connection).  As more an more albergues share their WiFi this becomes less of an issue, and the guide will tell you which ones offer WiFi.\n\nAccommodation Directory:  \nA full directory of Albergues, camping, hotels, pensions, paradors, and cases rurales.  Over 900 in total, with special attention to those that can be booked online.\n\nStageless Guide:\nNo more \"stage anxiety\" or guide created bottlenecks.\n\nMaps:  \nOffline and online versions of a beautiful topographical may will give you a good view of the terrain ahead.\n\nPhotos: \nPhotos of albergues, monuments and other points of interest along the way.  Currently 900+ images and growing.\n\nScrollable Elevation Map:  \nThis one is hard to show with just a screenshot, but the elevation that appears at the top of every city page scrolls East to West.  One complete elevation, from St. Jean Pied de Port to Santiago, uninterrupted by page folds.\n\nComments:  \nAlbergue closed early for the season?  Have a restaurant that you want to share, or perhaps one to warn others about?  Every location in the app gives you the opportunity to leave a comment and to read the comments left by others. No registration necessary.\n\n¡Buen Camino and thank you for your support!"

      "label": "•THIS APPLICATION IS FOR DISNEY WORLD IN FLORIDA. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR DISNEYLAND IN CALIFORNIA, CHECK OUT OUR OTHER APP \"HIDDEN MICKEYS: DISNEYLAND\"•\n\nThere's an extra special way to enjoy Walt Disney World and this app is your guide. Hunting for \"Hidden Mickeys\" (images of Mickey Mouse cleverly concealed in WDW's theme parks, restaurants, hotels, and other areas by Disney artists and designers) is fun for all and a bona fide vacation mission for many Disney World fans.\n\nServing as the OFFICIAL application to Steven Barrett’s bestselling book “Hidden Mickeys – A Field Guide to Walt Disney World's Best Kept Secrets,” the mouse hunt is taken to a whole new level of interactivity with this application for iPhone and iPod Touch! \n\nUtilizing GPS tracking [iPhone only], your location is scanned and immediately lists the closest Hidden Mickeys to you. If you’re not in the parks, or if you’d rather scroll through the different locations, you are able to browse categorized lists of each Hidden Mickey location. Keep track of which Mickey’s you find with an easy to use built-in scoring system. Keep in mind – this is a scavenger hunt! The score counts if you want it to, so do your best and try to use the least amount of hints as possible.\n\nWhether you’re playing solo or with the whole family, you are able to keep separate user profiles to keep track of everyone’s progress. Spanning all four parks and documenting over 1200 Hidden Mickeys, this application will add a whole new level of entertainment to your trips to Disney World!\n\nIn this application you'll discover well over 1200 Hidden Mickeys throughout various locations at the Walt Disney World Resort including:\n• Magic Kingdom Park \n• Epcot\n• Disney's Hollywood Studios\n• Disney’s Animal Kingdom\n• Blizzard Beach & Typhoon Lagoon Water Parks\n• Disney Springs\n• EPSN Wide World of Sports\n• Miniature Golf Courses\n• Over 20 DIFFERENT Disney Hotels\n\nPLUS: tips, hints and author Steven Barrett's very own favorite Hidden Mickeys. We've also included the use of Game Center, which allows you gain achievements while playing! We've even hidden a few of these that can only unlock from certain places inside the park - can you get them all?\n\nTrue to their name, Hidden Mickeys are elusive. New ones appear from time to time and some old ones disappear. When that happens — and it will — Steve will let you know on his web site: www.HiddenMickeysGuide.com. Periodically, the application will be updated to reflect these changes, becoming your best source for all things Hidden Mickeys!\n\n“Hidden Mickeys” is based off of the newest and most comprehensive edition of the book. “Hidden Mickeys – A Field Guide to Walt Disney World's Best Kept Secrets” 8th edition can be found for sale throughout Disney World, in stores, or online at Amazon.com."

Use it to find shopping now and for RVing later.\n\nWant to know where every Walmart is located and which ones have been reported to allow and don't allow overnight parking?\n\nFilter map to see if has fuel, pharmacy, garden center, a restaurant and much more.\n\nThis app plots every Walmart store in the USA and Canada on the map view. It uses location services to find your location and as you move.\n\nLocal influence and RVer abuse have meant that about 1/4 of stores no longer allow overnights, so you might want ask a manager ahead of time. Please submit your reports to us so we can keep this app accurate. I get numerous reports about stores every single day. It’s always changing...\n\nWhat's in it: Walmart's of all kinds. Can you park there or have others been denied or even towed? Tips are provided from other RVers as to where to park in the lot. \n\nIt integrates nicely with maps to display up to 150 points of interest on a map.\n\nDon’t take even one more trip without Walmart Overnight Parking. It can always change by the time you get there but at least you can be aware of what others have experienced lately.\n\nAllstays LLC, the provider of this App is not affiliated with, sponsored by or in any way related to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.

      "label": "An excellent app for planning your gluten free meals prior to going on your Disney vacation and for finding a great gluten free dining experience once you get there.\n\n We all know that in order to get a seat at your favorite Disney restaurants, you need to make reservations 6 months in advance. Gluten Free Disney Dining helps you decide where a good gluten free meal is available and then make knowledgeable decisions for reservations. No more waiting until you get there to see what gluten free choices might available. Please be advised that although we make every attempt to keep our menus within the app current, Disney frequently changes their gluten free choices. Gluten Free Disney Dining menus may not exactly match current Disney menus therefore, this app should be considered a general guide as to which restaurants have gluten free offerings and what type of offerings that they have. If you have any questions before you purchase the app, please feel free to write us at admin@calypsokidmedia.com. \n\nOver 450 menus with gluten free dining options for:\n\nWalt Disney World in Florida\n\nAND\n\nDisneyland in California\n\nMenus are updated as I get new information therefore the app will be updated more often.\n\nCheck us out on Facebook \n\nwww.facebook.com/GlutenFreeDisneyDining\n\n     This app was born from a personal need for being able to plan gluten free meals and having a safe dining experience while vacationing at a Disney Property. It is for those looking for Gluten-free dining options only. No other food allergies are included within this app. The Walt Disney Company has embraced and accepted the special needs of those with food allergies. They provide many choices for those who either choose or need to avoid wheat products in their food. The one problem that I found is that we were never sure of what gluten free offerings would be available at the restaurants and resorts that we visited. Worry no more; making reservations has just gotten a lot easier!\n\n     With just a few swipes of your finger, you will be able to see what gluten-free offerings are available at virtually every eating-place at Disney World Florida AND Disneyland California. More than 300 menus in all. Future, free updates will get better and better and will eventually include other Disney properties. We've also started to expand all of the menus to include a description of each dining choice where applicable. The content will be updated as needed to keep the information within the app as current as possible.  \n     The information contained within this app comes from personal experiences from many visits to different Disney properties as well as information provided from the restaurants themselves. This app should be used as a general guide only because gluten free choices change frequently. For the best user experience, use on a device with a wifi or cellular data connection. \n\nThe Walt Disney Company and all things Disney are registered and trademarked and in no way affiliated with this app."

Had a brilliant flight………after 12 years of being frightened! What a fantastic feeling to have overcome this fear.\" \nThanks Victoria Brier \n\n\"I listened to this CD 5 days (25 minutes each day) prior to my trip. I had the BEST flight ever! Considering I drove off the last time I was supposed to fly, leaving my husband to board a plane for Vegas by himself, I needed help! This was the absolute best! At first I hated the anxiety I felt listening to the CD. I got over it. I LOVED the flight, looked out the window, actually went to the bathroom. I had a drink on the flight because I wanted to not because I needed it! I came home from my trip and booked two more trips! The freedom is awesome. Go for it!\"\nJo Anne. Denver, CO USA"

      "label": "Twiz puts the fun in functionality!  Simply pick a starting location (where you are) and then pick the place you want to get to.  Mr. Wizard will promptly make fun suggestions about how to get there using Transportation.  Mr. Wizard also estimates how long it will take to get there..  By tapping on the route, you get lots of helpful tips about the transportation system and you can share your experience of times and tips with other users.\n\nImagine you are on your first trip to the Grand Floridian.  You arrive at your hotel, unpack your bags and call your friends who happen to be staying at the Boardwalk Inn.  You decide you want to meet for dinner at the Flying Fish café… but you don’t have a car, and you have no idea how to get to the Boardwalk from the Grand Floridian.  You whip out your iPhone and the WDW Transportation Wizard comes to your rescue; promptly suggesting several routes involving boats, buses, or monorails.  He even tells you how long it’s likely to take so you won’t be late for dinner.  Thank you Mr Wizard!\n\nOr, perhaps you are a veteran of Disneyworld and love planning daily itineraries.  You plan your trip, making a careful schedule of where to eat and which parks to go to when.  You decide that a fun day at the Hollywood Studios would really be nicely topped off by dinner at Chefs de France.  But how long is it going to take to get there, and what is the funnest possible route (this is a vacation after all!)?  You pop out your iPhone and fire up the OLP WDW Transportation Wizard who gives you several recommendations.  Oh my gawrsh, I didn’t know you could take a boat from the Studios to Epcot!  That sounds like fun!  But I will have to allow at least 37 minutes for that trip so we better leave by 5PM to make sure we are in time for dinner at 6PM.  Thank you Mr Wizard!\n\nThe OLP WDW Transportation Wizard puts the magic of trip planning in your pocket.\n\n\n\nThe OLP TWiz is based on a program written in 1998 using a proprietary technology.  OLP Twiz has been thoroughly tested by thousands of happy users.  You can see the original twiz at ourlaughingplace.com where it is still in use today.  Lucky for you, you can now carry it around on your iPhone or Touch for ready access.\n\nReview from meltdowndisney.com: \nApp alert: The OLP WDW Transportation Wizard for Walt Disney World is the best way you are going to invest 8 quarters. After searching for this functionality in a site, which I really thought I had seen, I noticed this app during a buying binge last week.\nEven from my couch, I could figure out how to get from Pop Century to The (Real Fantasyland of) Grand Floridian for a pedicure, without scuffing my toes. Especially if you have a child who is committed to taking a particular mode of transportation, this app will give you best case scenario guesses on how long it will take get from point a to point b. Wish I’d had it on my last trips, as does the restaurant manager who smiled as I explained that we took a bus, then a boat to the character meal that was about to close, instead of a plain old bus, which according to “Twiz” would have saved us about 25 minutes. Did I mention it was $1.99? Yes, U.S. $1.99, but still. If you are traveling with a small group, one might suffice. If you are traveling with anyone in my family, make sure everyone has one (especially if you plan to split up for a few hours for naps or swimming) so you don’t have to share, or wait at the turnstile for that last little straggler getting off the boat. Saving time is saving Disney Dollars. Invest."

Each includes extensive commentary that doesn’t just say, “Take that road because it’s good for lions,” but instead explains the geology of each area, which in turn informs the flora that grows there, the herbivores that eat that flora and, ultimately, the predators that hunt those herbivores.\n- Each route will help you develop an intimate insight into Kruger’s incredible wilderness.\n- Each of the rest camps and entrance gates is covered with short, medium and full-day routes to explore.\n\nThe Maps are the most detailed and up-to-date available:\n- They include newly opened roads and correct errors found in the maps available in the park shops. \n- For first-time visitors to Kruger, note that you are not provided with a map and must buy one from a park shop at a cost similar to this App.\n- The live GPS map means you'll never get lost.\n\nWith over half a million words of content, KrugerExplorer is the most comprehensive and unparalleled encyclopedia for the Greater Kruger ever created.\n\nSince launching in 2019, the App has had a superb reception from fans and received wonderful accolades:\n- Downloads in over 80 countries\n- App Store “App of the Day”\n- “Recommended” commendation by BirdLife South Africa\n- “Highly Recommended” by Getaway Magazine\n\nKrugerExplorer is also a global community of wildlife lovers.

      "label": "No account necessary.  No hidden costs.  All updates are free.\n\nNow in their 11th year as a mobile app, and their 13th online, the Wise Pilgrim Guides are the go-to source of up-to-date information on the Camino de Santiago.\n\nThe app is updated regularly with new content and new features and offers you the ability to leave tips for pilgrims following behind you.\n\nThis guide covers the Camino Portugués and its three most common variations; the Central Route, the Coastal Route, and the Variante Espiritual. It has been redesigned and now works almost exclusively offline (to share your comments with others will require a data connection).  As more an more albergues share their WiFi this becomes less of an issue, and the guide will tell you which ones offer WiFi.\n\nAccommodation Directory:  \nA full directory of Albergues, camping, hotels, pensions, paradors, and cases rurales.  Over 400 in total, with special attention to those that can be booked online.\n\nStageless Guide:\nNo more \"stage anxiety\" or guide created bottlenecks.\n\nMaps:  \nOffline and online versions of a beautiful topographical may will give you a good view of the terrain ahead.\n\nPhotos: \nPhotos of albergues, monuments and other points of interest along the way.  Currently 400+ images and growing.\n\nScrollable Elevation Map:  \nThis one is hard to show with just a screenshot, but the elevation that appears at the top of every city page scrolls East to West.  One complete elevation, from St. Jean Pied de Port to Santiago, uninterrupted by page folds.\n\nComments:  \nAlbergue closed early for the season?  Have a restaurant that you want to share, or perhaps one to warn others about?  Every location in the app gives you the opportunity to leave a comment and to read the comments left by others. No registration necessary.\n\n¡Buen Camino and thank you for your support!"

Well, today's your lucky day!\n\nIntroducing our new offline Death Valley National Park (and surrounding areas) photo guide. Now you can get all the great photos, content, and exact locations that you already love in Fotospot, but with one big difference - offline maps! When you have a working WiFi connection, simply download our offline guide to your device and, like magic, the app will now work when you don't have an internet connection. You'll be able to check in, save attractions for later, add new photos, and - best of all - find the exact locations of all the coolest Death Valley spots including Zabriskie Point, Darwin Falls, Natural Bridge Death Valley, Artist’s Palette, and Badwater Basin - all without having a working cell signal!\n\nPlease note, some of these attractions can be found in our flagship app, Fotospot, but with two huge differences:\n\n1. Exclusive Content \nSome of the coolest (and hardest to find) attractions can only be found here like Teakettle Junction, Mosaic Canyon, Keane Wonder Mine, Sidewinder Canyon, Aguereberry Point, and the Leadfield Ghost Town, plus a ton more.\n\n2. Offline Maps\nUnlike Fotospot, our Death Valley photo guide works even when you don't have a working cell signal (and that's basically the entire park).\n\nOne-time payment:\nWe don't have any upsells, in-app purchases, or subscriptions in this app, so for a simple one-time purchase, all of this can be yours for life. Plus, you'll automatically get any new future attractions we add to the app for FREE!\n\nLeave no trace:\nWhen visiting any attraction (in our app or not) please be responsible and leave it exactly how you found it. Take only photos and leave only footprints. To learn more please visit LNT.org.\n\nHappy exploring,\nThe Fotospot Team\n\n#fotospotting\n#fotospotapp"

      "label": "Love exploring Joshua Tree but hate that you can't get a cell signal in the park, making it nearly impossible to find the best sights? Well, today's your lucky day!\n\nIntroducing our new offline Joshua Tree National Park (and surrounding areas) photo guide. Now you can get all the great photos, content, and exact locations that you already love in Fotospot, but with one big difference - offline maps! When you have a working WiFi connection, simply download our offline guide to your device and, like magic, the app will now work when you don't have an internet connection. You'll be able to check in, save attractions for later, add new photos, and - best of all - find the exact locations of all the coolest Joshua Tree spots including Heart Rock, Lost Horse Mine, Barker Dam, and Skull Rock - all without having a working cell signal!\n\nPlease note, some of these attractions can be found in our flagship app, Fotospot, but with two huge differences:\n\n1. Exclusive Content \nSome of the coolest (and hardest to find) attractions can only be found here like the Iron Door Cave, Penguin Rock, Eagle Cliff Boulder House, Samuelson Rocks, the Freak Brothers, and Garrett's Arch (the largest arch in the park!), plus a ton more.\n\n2. Offline Maps\nUnlike Fotospot, our Joshua Tree photo guide works even when you don't have a working cell signal (and that's basically the entire park).\n\nOne-time payment:\nWe don't have any upsells, in-app purchases, or subscriptions in this app, so for a simple one-time purchase, all of this can be yours for life. Plus, you'll automatically get any new future attractions we add to the app for FREE!\n\nLeave no trace:\nWhen visiting any attraction (in our app or not) please be responsible and leave it exactly how you found it. Take only photos and leave only footprints. To learn more please visit LNT.org.\n\nHappy exploring,\nThe Fotospot Team\n\n#fotospotting\n#fotospotapp"

      "label": "There are 140+ audio points that play automatically along the scenic drive, featuring the best things to see and do, stories, tips and driving directions.  \n\nProfessional tour guides share advice on how to prioritize your time at recommended “not to be missed” viewpoints, suggested side-trips and places of interest.\n\nTours work offline, using free GPS signal and location services, so no data roaming, network, or wifi is required while touring.\n\nVisit www.gypsyguide.com for route maps, sample audio, tips and advice and what to know before you go.\n\nIt’s Just Like Having a Tour Guide in Your Car™\n\nWHAT TO EXPECT:  \nThe Road to Hana is one of the world’s most scenic drives and a popular sightseeing activity to see Maui’s spectacular waterfalls, black sand beaches, bamboo forests, lava rock formations and amazing ocean views as you wind your way through 620 curves and 59 bridges.\n\nIf you prefer travelling independently, at your own pace, GyPSy Guide provides the best Road to Hana tour experience, along with the freedom to choose what you enjoy; squishing the black sand between your toes at Wai’anapanapa, hiking the Pipiwai Bamboo Trail, or maybe time to enjoy an extra slice of banana bread.\n\nYou can’t help but cheer on the world class windsurfers at Ho’okipa.  And you won’t need to worry about photoshopping the Rainbow Eucalyptus at the Ke’anae Arboretum or the stunning contrast between blue water and black lava rock at Ke’anae Peninsular.\n\nTake a moment to cool off with a quick swim at the pristine Hamoa Beach and see where Haleakala National Park descends from the summit to the sea and the “Seven Sacred Pools” of Oheo at the end of the drive.\n\nWith such a long day of exploring (expect 8-12 hours), it’s important to know the 5 “not to be missed” stops, and the many more suggestions if you have time.  Part of the secret to enjoying the journey is knowing how not to waste your time, and we have tips for that as well.\n\nOn the return drive from Hana, we’ll point out the not to be missed stops again as well as tell you stories about Hawaii’s fascinating history and rich culture.\n\nPlease note Highway #31 ‘backside route’ is not recommended for driving. Rental car insurance void.   Road can be closed for repairs, mudslides and flash floods.\n  \nWHAT YOU’LL SEE:\n\nSome of the highlights along the route include;\n\n•\tHo’okipa Beach Park\n•\tPaia\n•\tKe’anae Peninsular\n•\tWai’anapanapa Park, Black Sand Beach\n•\tHana\n•\tHamoa Beach\n•\tWailua Falls\n•\tTwin Falls\n•\tUpper Waikanai Falls (3 Bears)\n•\tPools of O’heo (Seven Sacred Pools)\n•\tPipiwai Bamboo Trail\n\n**Reservations to visit Wai'anapanapa State Park and black sand beach are now mandatory** \n\n\nBATTERY USAGE:\n++  Continued use of GPS/Location Services in the background increases battery usage.  We strongly recommend taking a cigarette style (DC outlet) car charger.  Avoid using a direct connection to the USB port of a rental vehicle.\n\nIPADS:\n** iPad models must include a GPS chip. Please note that Apple only install these on the iPad Wifi + Cellular models.  Wifi only iPad models have limited location service capabilities and are unable to play commentary automatically.\n\nDOWNLOADING:\nThe apps are larger in size in order to work offline.  You must be on wifi to download as the store may block the download over cellular networks.  \n\nABOUT US:\n\nGyPSy Guide™ produce award winning narrated audio tours along scenic drives and road trips around the world.  \n\nEnjoyed by travelers who prefer to set their own pace and itinerary on vacation, but enjoy a fun, informative and educational guided experience while driving themselves.  \n\nOur goal is to provide a great introduction to the region and inspire you to learn more and return.  \n\nNone of our apps include paid advertising or placements for benefit"

This makes it much easier to find RV dump stations along a route you've created in another app such as Road Trip Planner.\n- Send a dump station location to our app Road Trip Planner.  This helps in routing your travels (requires separate purchase of the Road Trip Planner app).\n\nWe want to expand our RV dump station database as much as possible, so we have made it easy for you to easily submit a new RV dump station - simply tap the + button below the map.  To correct or update dump station information, tap “Location Comment” in the detail view. We will be updating the database often.\n\nDue to the nature of dump stations constantly changing their status it's recommended you contact the dump station prior to using it to verify its existence."

Use the \"Layers\" icon to select which agencies you want displayed to create your own custom map. (Hint, the toggles are color coded to the color each layer is displayed in.)\n\n- Links are provided to each agency's website within the app, so that you can further your research as to what land use rules apply for each public land type - such as permits, fees, activities allowed, and limits of stay.\n\n- Map layers are stored on device - no internet connection required.\n\n- Be sure to turn on the 'Basic' base map to see the US Public Land labels for each land area. This base map layer is also stored entirely on your device, and can be utilized if you do not have an internet connection or would like to conserve bandwidth. \n\n- If you have an internet connection (or have cached them before going out of signal), you can utilize the built in Apple Maps and satellite view maps as the base layer underneath the public land overlays.\n\n- A boondocker's assistant - While US Public Lands is not specifically a camp site locator and does not have a database of specific sites, by turning on the satellite view map, you can better scout out trails, roads and signs of dispersed camping locations within the boundaries of the public land resources. \n\n- Quickly toggle between 'Show' and 'Hide' via the \"Map\" icon to more clearly see satellite images below.\n\n- If you have GPS access on your device, click the 'Locate Me' icon to show your present location - know what type of land you're on right now!\n\n- Built in search tool locates anything on device maps supports (requires internet access) - including cities, states, zip codes, addresses and points of interest. A pin is dropped at the search location.\n\n\nThank you to the Protected Area Database (PAD-US) of the U.S. Geological Survey for providing the public domain raw map data that we’ve been able to utilize to create this interactive overlayable mapping & navigation tool. We will update our maps in the future to stay in sync with improvements to this data set. \n\nPlease note, the USGS PAD-US database contains the “most up-to-date aggregation of Federal lands and waters” available, but this database is still evolving and some locations may not be listed and others may not have precisely accurate boundaries. Resolution across the nation may vary. And always remember - there may be private unmapped inholdings within any public lands - so always pay attention to local signage, indications, and information. \n\nThe US Public Lands app should only be used as an overview, and you should always confirm more precise details by consulting local field offices, administration websites, and other resources. Do not solely rely on this app for determining if you are on public or private land."

      "label": "Have a Plan. Register. Have a Back Up Plan. Make Roll Call. Get Selected. Get Airborne.\n\nOr access LOCAL INFO--before you depart, just after arrival--anytime. \n\nMilSpaceA app allows authorized U.S. government users to register for Department of Defense (DoD) military space-available travel. It is the exclusive app for all DoD travelers wanting a quick, easy, reliable, and authorized means to sign up for Space-A at primary departure terminals. \n\nVISITING FAMILY MEMBERS and TDY military & contractors are now using MilSpaceA app as well--there's MUCH MORE here than just space-a signup.\n\nExpanded LOCAL INFO: billeting, car rental, dining, Exchange info, links to air terminals' pages, USOs, & more.\nAIRCRAFT GALLERY: depictions & basic descriptions of DoD pax aircraft\nTRAVEL ADVISORIES - announcements of temporary conditions affecting space-a\nSIGNUP ARCHIVE - stored in-app (as well as in user's own e-mail \"Sent\" items)\nFOREIGN CURRENCY - daily exchange rates for AOIs\nDOCUMENT LIBRARY:  key space-a documents:  policy, guides, handbooks, AMCGrams\nENHANCED ONLINE MAPPING: Your location shown relative to points of interest in the app (requires active geolocation & Internet access). \n\nFirst, browse through \"Airfields of Interest\".  Call ahead to various terminals (call-enabled for iPhone) or visit terminals’ flight schedule pages (if they have them--most don't). Then fill in your details, select departure airfields and destination countries, and send out the signup to register for travel. Some terminals will reply; most will not. Just keep a copy of e-mail(s) as proof of signup.\n\n• Remote space-a signup for multiple airfields. Prepare off- or online--then transmit when you have connectivity.\n• Multi-branch terminal support (Air Force, Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, Guard & Reserve)\n• Complies with Air Mobility Command rules: Signups generated by you, your e-mail as the sender & reply-to address. Copies saved directly in your e-mail Sent items, retrievable anytime.\n• Data privacy: No SSAN required. Exclusive AMC-authorized Pseudo Person ID (PPID) auto-created. (Some Navy locations still insist on SSANs--contact them directly after signup to pass SSAN).  \n• NEW: Now includes optional fields for DoD ID numbers, dates of birth, and passport info.\n• Full control of your data--ability to purge anytime.\n\n***\n\"My mom came to visit me and she used the app, too (...) It's great for anyone visiting [the base].\" - LT\n\"Amazing how easy this app made our trip. This and our books together, because weird or not, I still like the smell of paper\" - JD\n\"Great app. Very easy to use\" - TT\n***\n\nPolicies governing space-a are implemented in DoD Directive 4515.13-R (Air Transportation Eligibility) and AMCI 24-101 Vol 14. Determine your eligibility before registering for travel. CONTACT YOUR LOCAL TERMINAL if you have any questions of eligibility. Refer to http://www.amc.af.mil/amctravel for current official AMC policy. Utilize and support pepperd.com, spacea.net & takeahop.org for unofficial discussions, info, and desktop-based space-a signup.\n\nOnly after mission requirements are met will remaining seats be offered up for space-a. Be prepared for delays or short-notice diversions. Space-A is a privilege, not a right--movement is never guaranteed. UNDERSTAND THE BASICS OF SPACE-A before signing up.\n\nMore about Take-a-Hop--and its MilSpaceA app)\n\nSince inception, Take-a-Hop's platform has generated MILLIONS of space-a signups. Trusted by passengers and passenger service agents (PSAs) alike. Used by tens of thousands of DoD travelers. Solely managed by a USAF veteran who has also traveled military space-a and knows what travelers are up against. MilSpaceA app is not endorsed by the US Federal Government, DoD, or any branch thereof. And still, it's the name recommended by thousands and earning your trust for years.\n\nThanks and Happy Travels!\n\nWEB at www.takeahop.com/app\nLIKE on www.facebook.com/takeahop"

Use it to find shopping now and for RVing later.\n\nWant to know where every Walmart is located and which ones have been reported to allow and don't allow overnight parking?\n\nFilter map to see if has fuel, pharmacy, garden center, a restaurant and much more.\n\nThis app plots every Walmart store in the USA and Canada on the map view. It uses location services to find your location and as you move.\n\nLocal influence and RVer abuse have meant that about 1/4 of stores no longer allow overnights, so you might want ask a manager ahead of time. Please submit your reports to us so we can keep this app accurate. I get numerous reports about stores every single day. It’s always changing...\n\nWhat's in it: Walmart's of all kinds. Can you park there or have others been denied or even towed? Tips are provided from other RVers as to where to park in the lot. \n\nIt integrates nicely with maps to display up to 150 points of interest on a map.\n\nDon’t take even one more trip without Walmart Overnight Parking. It can always change by the time you get there but at least you can be aware of what others have experienced lately.\n\nAllstays LLC, the provider of this App is not affiliated with, sponsored by or in any way related to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.

No hidden costs.\n\nNow in their 11th year as a mobile app, and their 13th online, the Wise Pilgrim Guides are the go-to source of up-to-date information on the Camino de Santiago.\n\nThe app is updated regularly with new content and new features and offers you the ability to leave tips for pilgrims following behind you.\n\nThis guide covers the Camino del Norte from Irún to Santiago de Compostela and includes all of the alternate routes along the way. It has been redesigned and now works almost exclusively offline (to share your comments with others will require a data connection).  As more an more albergues share their WiFi this becomes less of an issue, and the guide will tell you which ones offer WiFi.\n\nAccommodation Directory:  \nA full directory of Albergues, camping, hotels, pensions, paradors, and cases rurales.  Over 500 in total, with special attention to those that can be booked online.\n\nStageless Guide:\nNo more \"stage anxiety\" or guide created bottlenecks.\n\nMaps:  \nOffline and online versions of a beautiful topographical may will give you a good view of the terrain ahead.\n\nPhotos: \nPhotos of albergues, monuments and other points of interest along the way.  Currently 400+ images and growing.\n\nScrollable Elevation Map:  \nThis one is hard to show with just a screenshot, but the elevation that appears at the top of every city page scrolls East to West.  One complete elevation, from Irún to Santiago, uninterrupted by page folds.\n\nComments:  \nAlbergue closed early for the season?  Have a restaurant that you want to share, or perhaps one to warn others about?  Every location in the app gives you the opportunity to leave a comment and to read the comments left by others. No registration necessary.\n\n¡Buen Camino and thank you for your support!"

If more than 80 stations are in the area being viewed, a random assortment of 80 stations will be displayed.\n\nThere is no \"phoning home\" with data, personal or not.  If a data connection is available, the FCC servers will be asked for contour plot data when a tower is selected. This will show up as a blue overlay showing the calculated area over which the signal will drop off by at most 35 dBu. Basically, this is the area where an antenna not too near the ground has a chance to receive the signal; your luck will vary. Once downloaded, the data is stored for the next time you select the tower.\n\nErrors and omissions are to be expected especially for stations with low power licenses.

      "label": "•THIS APPLICATION IS FOR DISNEY WORLD IN FLORIDA. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR DISNEYLAND IN CALIFORNIA, CHECK OUT OUR OTHER APP \"HIDDEN MICKEYS: DISNEYLAND\"•\n\nThere's an extra special way to enjoy Walt Disney World and this app is your guide. Hunting for \"Hidden Mickeys\" (images of Mickey Mouse cleverly concealed in WDW's theme parks, restaurants, hotels, and other areas by Disney artists and designers) is fun for all and a bona fide vacation mission for many Disney World fans.\n\nServing as the OFFICIAL application to Steven Barrett’s bestselling book “Hidden Mickeys – A Field Guide to Walt Disney World's Best Kept Secrets,” the mouse hunt is taken to a whole new level of interactivity with this application for iPhone and iPod Touch! \n\nUtilizing GPS tracking [iPhone only], your location is scanned and immediately lists the closest Hidden Mickeys to you. If you’re not in the parks, or if you’d rather scroll through the different locations, you are able to browse categorized lists of each Hidden Mickey location. Keep track of which Mickey’s you find with an easy to use built-in scoring system. Keep in mind – this is a scavenger hunt! The score counts if you want it to, so do your best and try to use the least amount of hints as possible.\n\nWhether you’re playing solo or with the whole family, you are able to keep separate user profiles to keep track of everyone’s progress. Spanning all four parks and documenting over 1200 Hidden Mickeys, this application will add a whole new level of entertainment to your trips to Disney World!\n\nIn this application you'll discover well over 1200 Hidden Mickeys throughout various locations at the Walt Disney World Resort including:\n• Magic Kingdom Park \n• Epcot\n• Disney's Hollywood Studios\n• Disney’s Animal Kingdom\n• Blizzard Beach & Typhoon Lagoon Water Parks\n• Disney Springs\n• EPSN Wide World of Sports\n• Miniature Golf Courses\n• Over 20 DIFFERENT Disney Hotels\n\nPLUS: tips, hints and author Steven Barrett's very own favorite Hidden Mickeys. We've also included the use of Game Center, which allows you gain achievements while playing! We've even hidden a few of these that can only unlock from certain places inside the park - can you get them all?\n\nTrue to their name, Hidden Mickeys are elusive. New ones appear from time to time and some old ones disappear. When that happens — and it will — Steve will let you know on his web site: www.HiddenMickeysGuide.com. Periodically, the application will be updated to reflect these changes, becoming your best source for all things Hidden Mickeys!\n\n“Hidden Mickeys” is based off of the newest and most comprehensive edition of the book. “Hidden Mickeys – A Field Guide to Walt Disney World's Best Kept Secrets” 8th edition can be found for sale throughout Disney World, in stores, or online at Amazon.com."

Some common, some not so common. Some we had heard about, but didn’t know where to find, in order to view and photograph them. \n\nWe decided to pull our experience and data together and make discovering them available to everyone.\n\nA great app for photographers trying to capture the beauty of Sedona, and hikers that want to find these amazing and amusing rock formations.\n\nTo those that use our Sedona Hiking App the trail names mentioned in the description and directions will be familiar, but if not, have no fear. The treks to view these formations will not require serious hiking skills, just common sense and proper preparation for the time of year. Most of the View Points we have are easy access and do not require climbing or hard hiking.\n\nIn the App we have marked the actual location of the rock formations themselves and one or more View Points where these amazing rock formations can be seen, photographed and enjoyed. We will tell you what trails take you near the landmarks when it applies and show you an offline map that can give your location on the trail in real-time.\n\nOnce you know where these formations are you’ll begin to see them from all over town.\n\nWe've included these delights:\nCathedral Rock\nBell Rock\nChapel of the Holy Cross\nChimney Rock\nCoffee Pot Rock\nCourthouse Butte\nDevil's Kitchen\nFay Canyon Arch\nGibraltar Rock\nMerry-Go-Round\nThe Rabbit Ears\nSnoopy Rock\nTeacup Rock\nTwo Nuns\nDevil's Bridge\nCapital Butte\nElephant Rock\nMadonna and Child\n\nThe App uses Apple Maps and needs a network connection."

In cities like New York where you have to swipe your transit card to unlock the turnstile, forgetting your balance and being greeted by an \"insufficient funds\" message can be annoying, and delay your journey.\n\nMetroBuddy lets you enter your current MetroCard balance, and update it each time you swipe. Never lose time at the MetroCard reader again, your balance will always be available on your phone! The app also calculates how many rides you have left, based on your fare. Use the History tab to review the changes you made to your balance.\n\nMetroBuddy also provides Siri shortcuts to record a swipe and check your balance. This enables you to build powerful automation for your commute, such as recording a swipe, starting your favorite playlist, and checking the next train departure.\n\nIf you are using iOS 14 or later, you can add a widget to your home screen or your widget center to view your balance even faster.\n\nWe are proud to be working on making MetroBuddy as inclusive as possible. You can change your fare if you have a more affordable one. The app is also fully compatible with iOS assistive technologies such as VoiceOver, Dynamic Type, and VoiceControl. Turnstiles are not fully accessible, but MetroBuddy is.\n\nDo not hesitate to reach out with feedback and/or questions by e-mail at hi@alexisonline.dev.\n\nPlease note that MetroBuddy is a hobby app and is not affiliated with New York's MTA in any way."

Ideal for almost anything that requires measuring outdoor distance traveled such as walking, running, driving, boating, or hiking.  Note that GPS does not work well under a roof.  For best results, use outdoors.\n\nBenefits of the paid version:\n- Landscape and splitscreen support.\n- Ability to have multiple trips.  Each trip can be stopped and started independently.\n- Receive notifications while the application is closed at distance intervals of your choosing.\n- Custom units readout.  For example, you want to know how many calories you have burned.  You can customize this to include anything that has a linear relationship with distance traveled.  This can be different for each trip.\n- No advertisements.\n- Export trips via email and optionally restore later.\n\nDisplays:\n- Distance\n- Time elapsed\n- Speed (average or current)\n- Displacement (straight line distance from your starting point) This can be hidden.\n\nDistance units include:\n- Kilometers\n- Miles\n- Nautical miles\n- Meters\n- Feet\n\nSpeed units include:\n- Kilometers per hour\n- Miles per hour\n- Nautical miles per hour\n- Meters per second\n- Feet per second\n\nOther features:\n- Large font adjustable display.\n- Accurate to within 1 percent when compared to most car odometers under normal driving conditions.\n- Includes a lock to help prevent accidental reset of your trip. After unlocked, it locks back in a few seconds, or you can lock it yourself.\n- Approximates distance traveled in some GPS dead spots such as driving through a tunnel by adding the as-a-bird flies distance to your trip.\n\nPlease also note:\n- GPS Odometer does run in the background if you leave it running.  Be sure to pause the trip when you are finished or battery life will be negatively affected.  The timer stops when the trip is paused.\n- To change the display, tap the unlock button and notice the three green boxes that temporarily appear. Each button adjusts a different part of the display.\n- You can change the language to English in the application settings.\n\nPlease visit the web page for more details."

Yes, it can be a lot to cover. So, spread it out over a couple of days, take a break for lunch, or maybe stop at one of the Smithsonians along the way. It's like having your own personal tour guide, at a fraction of the price. \n\nTwo Buck Tours include maps with GPS, directions, photos, tips, interesting information about each site, and are narrated in English. No schedules, no crowds, no worries.\n\nGood for tourists and locals of all ages. Not visiting DC anytime soon? The text and photos will let you experience the city on your own."

      "label": "eCurrency is far more than an easy to use currency converter and handy calculator. It supports over 200 popular currencies; works without active internet connection and even supports custom rates. eCurrency offers rich graphical charts for all exchange rates and supports calculations with historical exchange rates, making this the perfect tool for business, overseas travel and for anyone interested in currency trading.\n\neCurrency offers the following features:\n\n► Easy-to-use appealing interface\n► One screen for all major functionalities\n► Designated keypad for fast number entry; plus a handy built-in math’s calculator\n► Configures up to 8 converters; swipe through as on the iPhone‘s home screen\n► Supports over 200 currencies (for a full list see: http://bit.ly/knBkeS)\n► Detailed graphical charts for all exchange rates (1-week, 1-month, 3-months, 6-months, 1-year, 2-years, and 5-years)\n► Automatic setting of home currency and number formatting \n► Reliable functionality: No active internet connection required\n► Exchange rates automatically updated on startup (Automatic update can be deactivated to avoid roaming costs)\n► Supports custom exchange rate entry\n► One touch reverse currency conversion\n► Special ‘shake to inverse calculation’ feature\n► Select and create a list of preferred currencies for fast access\n\n\n==Easy to use interface==\neCurrency interface is designed for ease of use. Just start the application and type in the amount you want to convert and eCurrency converts instantly. Tap on one of the flags to change the currency you want to convert to. A built-in calculator allows for math calculations. The current exchange rate and rate change compared to the previous day is conveniently displayed in the main interface.\n\n==Favorites Support==\neCurrency supports over 200 currencies. The “Favorites” functionality allows you to define the currency pairs you use as favorites. To create a new favorite go into the “Settings” and touch the “+” Button.

The map rotates to align with the direction you're facing, so you can easily identify aircraft that you see around you. Use the digital crown to zoom in/out and touch & drag on the screen to move around the map.\n\nUnfiltered Flight Data\nPlaneWatcher shows you all aircraft, unfiltered, unlike most major flight tracking apps. Made possible by our amazing data provider ADSBExchange, the world's largest source of unfiltered flight data.\n\nLocal & Worldwide\nView aircraft around your current location or jump to any airport in the world. Use the digital crown to zoom in on a busy LAX or watch aircraft taking off and landing at JFK.\n\nAircraft Details\nSimply tap on an aircraft to see all its details: flight name, registration, type, category, operator, altitude, speeds and more (depending on data availability).\n\nAircraft Following\nInterested in a single aircraft? Follow it as it proceeds among the other traffic. Just tap the small blue dot to exit follow mode and return to the main map.\n\nMultiple Filters\nJust want to see aircraft below 10'000 feet, Boeing 747s or only planes from a certain airline?

See NYC the way it was meant to be seen: on foot.\n\nSixteen sights are included in the tour, covering about 3.5 miles. Rain? Take a break and resume later. It's like having your own personal tour guide, at a fraction of the price.\n\nTwo Buck Tours include narration (in English), maps with GPS, directions, photos, and interesting information about each sight. Good for tourists and locals of all ages. No schedules, no crowds, no worries."

      "label": "Do you have favorite hotel chains? This universal app makes it easy to find chain locations nearest you (or far away). With or without service. No waiting for data, ads or being thrown in a queue.\n\nPlease read to know why this app is unique.\n\n- This is a independent app that is like no other. It is about choice, not deals.\n\n- REAL hotel phone numbers. The data is on the app so you don't have to wait or hunt for phone numbers.\n\n- REAL website links directly to each property.\n\n- You book direct over the phone or their official website, NOT the app. The app does not do booking and you are not queued up overseas by a third party.\n\n- Easily find favorite chains with map filters or a manual lookup by chain. Like our website, no one else lets you find Ritz-Carltons or Motel 6 together. The choice is yours.\n\n- Filter by brand umbrella. Prefer to gets points at only Marriott brands? Hyatt? Choice? See just the overall group you want.\n\n- Filter by amenity. Look for a pool, restaurant, internet, fitness center, business center, extended stays, pet friendly or truck/bus parking.\n\n- Includes a independent category that has many hotels and motels you won't find in other apps.\n\n- No ads inside the app or corporate deals to throw certain brands at you and hide others.\n\n- We are not making money on every booking like other apps do. No preferred brands to push on you.\n\n- This app is universal for all iOS devices. Most locators are not.\n\n- Find the nearest ones to you right now on the map view. Tap the compass button to re-center around you at anytime. You don't need a zipcode.\n\n- Planning ahead for other places? Type a city in the search box and jump there on the map.\n\n- No service to display maps? Use the in-app manual lookup. This is a big reason. Other hotel apps always require internet service. When you want to find something, you want to find it fast no matter what.\n\n- Tap a location for more information such as distance from your current location, phone number, address, directions, important amenities and the official website, photo search and review search.\n\n- Easily report errors, changes, closures or post important comments from each locations detail view.\n\n- It does not do everything that other apps already do. This is for when you know the type of hotel that you want and you just want to find it fast.\n\nFor all features and best results, a GPS enabled device is recommended but this is designed to run on all devices. The data is stored locally on your device. Using the manual lookup button, you can find places by state and city without internet service. You can list all places or just one preferred location.\n\nThis data is USA only right now.\n\nThis app is completely ad and sponsor free but you can connect to the official websites of the hotel companies and reviews. THEY may have ads on them and we don't control those companies and how they present their own data.\n\nAllStays LLC is a independent travel site that lists all types of lodging."

It has been redesigned and now works almost exclusively offline (to share your comments with others will require a data connection).  As more an more albergues share their WiFi this becomes less of an issue, and the guide will tell you which ones offer WiFi.\n\nAccommodation Directory:  \nA full directory of Albergues, camping, hotels, pensions, paradors, and cases rurales; with special attention to those that can be booked online.\n\nStageless Guide:\nNo more \"stage anxiety\" or guide created bottlenecks.\n\nMaps:  \nOffline and online versions of a beautiful topographical may will give you a good view of the terrain ahead.\n\nPhotos: \nPhotos of albergues, monuments and other points of interest along the way.  Currently 900+ images and growing.\n\nScrollable Elevation Map:  \nThis one is hard to show with just a screenshot, but the elevation that appears at the top of every city page scrolls East to West.  One complete elevation, from St. Jean Pied de Port to Santiago, uninterrupted by page folds.\n\nComments:  \nAlbergue closed early for the season?  Have a restaurant that you want to share, or perhaps one to warn others about?  Every location in the app gives you the opportunity to leave a comment and to read the comments left by others. No registration necessary.\n\n¡Buen Camino and thank you for your support!"

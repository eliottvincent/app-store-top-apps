      "label": "There are 140+ audio points that play automatically along the scenic drive, featuring the best things to see and do, stories, tips and driving directions.  \n\nProfessional tour guides share advice on how to prioritize your time at recommended “not to be missed” viewpoints, suggested side-trips and places of interest.\n\nTours work offline, using free GPS signal and location services, so no data roaming, network, or wifi is required while touring.\n\nVisit www.gypsyguide.com for route maps, sample audio, tips and advice and what to know before you go.\n\nIt’s Just Like Having a Tour Guide in Your Car™\n\nWHAT TO EXPECT:  \nThe Road to Hana is one of the world’s most scenic drives and a popular sightseeing activity to see Maui’s spectacular waterfalls, black sand beaches, bamboo forests, lava rock formations and amazing ocean views as you wind your way through 620 curves and 59 bridges.\n\nIf you prefer travelling independently, at your own pace, GyPSy Guide provides the best Road to Hana tour experience, along with the freedom to choose what you enjoy; squishing the black sand between your toes at Wai’anapanapa, hiking the Pipiwai Bamboo Trail, or maybe time to enjoy an extra slice of banana bread.\n\nYou can’t help but cheer on the world class windsurfers at Ho’okipa.  And you won’t need to worry about photoshopping the Rainbow Eucalyptus at the Ke’anae Arboretum or the stunning contrast between blue water and black lava rock at Ke’anae Peninsular.\n\nTake a moment to cool off with a quick swim at the pristine Hamoa Beach and see where Haleakala National Park descends from the summit to the sea and the “Seven Sacred Pools” of Oheo at the end of the drive.\n\nWith such a long day of exploring (expect 8-12 hours), it’s important to know the 5 “not to be missed” stops, and the many more suggestions if you have time.  Part of the secret to enjoying the journey is knowing how not to waste your time, and we have tips for that as well.\n\nOn the return drive from Hana, we’ll point out the not to be missed stops again as well as tell you stories about Hawaii’s fascinating history and rich culture.\n\nPlease note Highway #31 ‘backside route’ is not recommended for driving. Rental car insurance void.   Road can be closed for repairs, mudslides and flash floods.\n  \nWHAT YOU’LL SEE:\n\nSome of the highlights along the route include;\n\n•\tHo’okipa Beach Park\n•\tPaia\n•\tKe’anae Peninsular\n•\tWai’anapanapa Park, Black Sand Beach\n•\tHana\n•\tHamoa Beach\n•\tWailua Falls\n•\tTwin Falls\n•\tUpper Waikanai Falls (3 Bears)\n•\tPools of O’heo (Seven Sacred Pools)\n•\tPipiwai Bamboo Trail\n\n**Reservations to visit Wai'anapanapa State Park and black sand beach are now mandatory** \n\n\nBATTERY USAGE:\n++  Continued use of GPS/Location Services in the background increases battery usage.  We strongly recommend taking a cigarette style (DC outlet) car charger.  Avoid using a direct connection to the USB port of a rental vehicle.\n\nIPADS:\n** iPad models must include a GPS chip. Please note that Apple only install these on the iPad Wifi + Cellular models.  Wifi only iPad models have limited location service capabilities and are unable to play commentary automatically.\n\nDOWNLOADING:\nThe apps are larger in size in order to work offline.  You must be on wifi to download as the store may block the download over cellular networks.  \n\nABOUT US:\n\nGyPSy Guide™ produce award winning narrated audio tours along scenic drives and road trips around the world.  \n\nEnjoyed by travelers who prefer to set their own pace and itinerary on vacation, but enjoy a fun, informative and educational guided experience while driving themselves.  \n\nOur goal is to provide a great introduction to the region and inspire you to learn more and return.  \n\nNone of our apps include paid advertising or placements for benefit"

Get Airborne.\n\nOr access LOCAL INFO--before you depart, just after arrival--anytime. \n\nMilSpaceA app allows authorized U.S. government users to register for Department of Defense (DoD) military space-available travel. It is the exclusive app for all DoD travelers wanting a quick, easy, reliable, and authorized means to sign up for Space-A at primary departure terminals. \n\nVISITING FAMILY MEMBERS and TDY military & contractors are now using MilSpaceA app as well--there's MUCH MORE here than just space-a signup.\n\nExpanded LOCAL INFO: billeting, car rental, dining, Exchange info, links to air terminals' pages, USOs, & more.\nAIRCRAFT GALLERY: depictions & basic descriptions of DoD pax aircraft\nTRAVEL ADVISORIES - announcements of temporary conditions affecting space-a\nSIGNUP ARCHIVE - stored in-app (as well as in user's own e-mail \"Sent\" items)\nFOREIGN CURRENCY - daily exchange rates for AOIs\nDOCUMENT LIBRARY:  key space-a documents:  policy, guides, handbooks, AMCGrams\nENHANCED ONLINE MAPPING: Your location shown relative to points of interest in the app (requires active geolocation & Internet access). \n\nFirst, browse through \"Airfields of Interest\".  Call ahead to various terminals (call-enabled for iPhone) or visit terminals’ flight schedule pages (if they have them--most don't). Then fill in your details, select departure airfields and destination countries, and send out the signup to register for travel. Some terminals will reply; most will not. Just keep a copy of e-mail(s) as proof of signup.\n\n• Remote space-a signup for multiple airfields. Prepare off- or online--then transmit when you have connectivity.\n• Multi-branch terminal support (Air Force, Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, Guard & Reserve)\n• Complies with Air Mobility Command rules: Signups generated by you, your e-mail as the sender & reply-to address. Copies saved directly in your e-mail Sent items, retrievable anytime.\n• Data privacy: No SSAN required. Exclusive AMC-authorized Pseudo Person ID (PPID) auto-created. (Some Navy locations still insist on SSANs--contact them directly after signup to pass SSAN).  \n• NEW: Now includes optional fields for DoD ID numbers, dates of birth, and passport info.\n• Full control of your data--ability to purge anytime.\n\n***\n\"My mom came to visit me and she used the app, too (...) It's great for anyone visiting [the base].\" - LT\n\"Amazing how easy this app made our trip. This and our books together, because weird or not, I still like the smell of paper\" - JD\n\"Great app. Very easy to use\" - TT\n***\n\nPolicies governing space-a are implemented in DoD Directive 4515.13-R (Air Transportation Eligibility) and AMCI 24-101 Vol 14. Determine your eligibility before registering for travel. CONTACT YOUR LOCAL TERMINAL if you have any questions of eligibility. Refer to http://www.amc.af.mil/amctravel for current official AMC policy. Utilize and support pepperd.com, spacea.net & takeahop.org for unofficial discussions, info, and desktop-based space-a signup.\n\nOnly after mission requirements are met will remaining seats be offered up for space-a. Be prepared for delays or short-notice diversions. Space-A is a privilege, not a right--movement is never guaranteed. UNDERSTAND THE BASICS OF SPACE-A before signing up.\n\nMore about Take-a-Hop--and its MilSpaceA app)\n\nSince inception, Take-a-Hop's platform has generated MILLIONS of space-a signups. Trusted by passengers and passenger service agents (PSAs) alike. Used by tens of thousands of DoD travelers. Solely managed by a USAF veteran who has also traveled military space-a and knows what travelers are up against. MilSpaceA app is not endorsed by the US Federal Government, DoD, or any branch thereof. And still, it's the name recommended by thousands and earning your trust for years.\n\nThanks and Happy Travels!\n\nWEB at www.takeahop.com/app\nLIKE on www.facebook.com/takeahop"

Use the \"Layers\" icon to select which agencies you want displayed to create your own custom map. (Hint, the toggles are color coded to the color each layer is displayed in.)\n\n- Links are provided to each agency's website within the app, so that you can further your research as to what land use rules apply for each public land type - such as permits, fees, activities allowed, and limits of stay.\n\n- Map layers are stored on device - no internet connection required.\n\n- Be sure to turn on the 'Basic' base map to see the US Public Land labels for each land area. This base map layer is also stored entirely on your device, and can be utilized if you do not have an internet connection or would like to conserve bandwidth. \n\n- If you have an internet connection (or have cached them before going out of signal), you can utilize the built in Apple Maps and satellite view maps as the base layer underneath the public land overlays.\n\n- A boondocker's assistant - While US Public Lands is not specifically a camp site locator and does not have a database of specific sites, by turning on the satellite view map, you can better scout out trails, roads and signs of dispersed camping locations within the boundaries of the public land resources. \n\n- Quickly toggle between 'Show' and 'Hide' via the \"Map\" icon to more clearly see satellite images below.\n\n- If you have GPS access on your device, click the 'Locate Me' icon to show your present location - know what type of land you're on right now!\n\n- Built in search tool locates anything on device maps supports (requires internet access) - including cities, states, zip codes, addresses and points of interest. A pin is dropped at the search location.\n\n\nThank you to the Protected Area Database (PAD-US) of the U.S. Geological Survey for providing the public domain raw map data that we’ve been able to utilize to create this interactive overlayable mapping & navigation tool. We will update our maps in the future to stay in sync with improvements to this data set. \n\nPlease note, the USGS PAD-US database contains the “most up-to-date aggregation of Federal lands and waters” available, but this database is still evolving and some locations may not be listed and others may not have precisely accurate boundaries. Resolution across the nation may vary. And always remember - there may be private unmapped inholdings within any public lands - so always pay attention to local signage, indications, and information. \n\nThe US Public Lands app should only be used as an overview, and you should always confirm more precise details by consulting local field offices, administration websites, and other resources. Do not solely rely on this app for determining if you are on public or private land."

This makes it much easier to find RV dump stations along a route you've created in another app such as Road Trip Planner.\n- Send a dump station location to our app Road Trip Planner.  This helps in routing your travels (requires separate purchase of the Road Trip Planner app).\n\nWe want to expand our RV dump station database as much as possible, so we have made it easy for you to easily submit a new RV dump station - simply tap the + button below the map.  To correct or update dump station information, tap “Location Comment” in the detail view. We will be updating the database often.\n\nDue to the nature of dump stations constantly changing their status it's recommended you contact the dump station prior to using it to verify its existence."

You get some rest, maybe shop a bit and move on early in the morning.\n\nHow will this app help you? RVer or not, this app shows all Walmart locations in US and Canada. Use it to find shopping now and for RVing later.\n\nWant to know where every Walmart is located and which ones have been reported to allow and don't allow overnight parking?\n\nFilter map to see if has fuel, pharmacy, garden center, a restaurant and much more.\n\nThis app plots every Walmart store in the USA and Canada on the map view. It uses location services to find your location and as you move.\n\nLocal influence and RVer abuse have meant that about 1/4 of stores no longer allow overnights, so you might want ask a manager ahead of time. Please submit your reports to us so we can keep this app accurate. I get numerous reports about stores every single day. It’s always changing...\n\nWhat's in it: Walmart's of all kinds. Can you park there or have others been denied or even towed? Tips are provided from other RVers as to where to park in the lot. \n\nIt integrates nicely with maps to display up to 150 points of interest on a map.\n\nDon’t take even one more trip without Walmart Overnight Parking. It can always change by the time you get there but at least you can be aware of what others have experienced lately.\n\nAllstays LLC, the provider of this App is not affiliated with, sponsored by or in any way related to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.

      "label": "Excited to take the Pacific Coast Highway from Morro Bay to Monterey (or vice versa), but nervous you won’t have cell coverage for most of the trip? Well, we’ve got you covered!\n\nIntroducing our new offline California Route 1 Road Trip photo guide. Now you can get all the great photos, content, and exact locations that you already love in Fotospot, but with one big difference - offline maps! When you have a working WiFi connection simply download our offline guide to your device and, like magic, the app will now work when you don't have an internet connection. You'll be able to check in, save attractions for later, add new photos, and - best of all - find the exact locations of all the coolest PCH spots including Morro Rock, Moonstone Beach, Hearst Castle, McWay Falls, the Bixby Creek Bridge, and the Lone Cypress (plus, all 17 spots along the 17-Mile Drive) - all without having a working cell signal!\n\nPlease note, some of these attractions can be found in our flagship app, Fotospot, but with two huge differences:\n\n1. Exclusive Content \nSome of the coolest (and hardest to find) attractions can only be found here like the Los Osos Bear, the Giant Chessboard, Morro Rock Cairns, the Cayucos Shipwreck, Nitt Witt Ridge, and the Hearst Castle Zebras, plus a ton more.\n\n2. Offline Maps\nUnlike Fotospot, our CA-1 Road Trip photo guide works even when you don't have a working cell signal.\n\nOne-time payment:\nWe don't have any upsells, in-app purchases, or subscriptions in this app, so for a simple one-time purchase, all of this can be yours for life. Plus, you'll automatically get any new future attractions we add to the app for FREE!\n\nLeave no trace:\nWhen visiting any attraction (in our app or not) please be responsible and leave it exactly how you found it. Take only photos and leave only footprints. To learn more please visit LNT.org.\n\nHappy exploring,\nThe Fotospot Team\n\n#fotospotting\n#fotospotapp"

In cities like New York where you have to swipe your transit card to unlock the turnstile, forgetting your balance and being greeted by an \"insufficient funds\" message can be annoying, and delay your journey.\n\nMetroBuddy lets you enter your current MetroCard balance, and update it each time you swipe. Never lose time at the MetroCard reader again, your balance will always be available on your phone! The app also calculates how many rides you have left, based on your fare. Use the History tab to review the changes you made to your balance.\n\nMetroBuddy also provides Siri shortcuts to record a swipe and check your balance. This enables you to build powerful automation for your commute, such as recording a swipe, starting your favorite playlist, and checking the next train departure.\n\nIf you are using iOS 14 or later, you can add a widget to your home screen or your widget center to view your balance even faster.\n\nWe are proud to be working on making MetroBuddy as inclusive as possible. You can change your fare if you have a more affordable one. The app is also fully compatible with iOS assistive technologies such as VoiceOver, Dynamic Type, and VoiceControl. Turnstiles are not fully accessible, but MetroBuddy is.\n\nDo not hesitate to reach out with feedback and/or questions by e-mail at hi@alexisonline.dev.\n\nPlease note that MetroBuddy is a hobby app and is not affiliated with New York's MTA in any way."

      "label": "Travel the world with confidence and enjoy local dishes without compromising your vegan beliefs! With your trusty Vegan Passport, you can be sure of finding vegan food in restaurants around the globe.\n\nThis multilingual vegan guide is a must-have for globetrotting vegans. It’s small enough to slip into your pocket, but big enough to include the languages of over 96% of the world’s population.\n\nThe fifth edition of this essential guide has been updated and expanded, and now boasts 78 languages including Hausa, Igbo, Xhosa and Zulu.\n\nIncluding fail-safe pictures, which can be used when words don’t work, the Vegan Passport has all situations covered. This will ensure that you have no problem explaining what you do and don’t eat, no matter where you are in the world.\n\nWhen visiting a restaurant, show your waiter the relevant entry from this app, and ask them to read it.  Do not attempt to pronounce the text yourself!  If you are invited to a private home for a meal, show your host the relevant entry well in advance.  \n\nIf booking a hotel by post or email, send a copy of the relevant page.  Please note that several languages may be used in the place you are visiting, so you may be able to offer the reader a choice of languages.  \n\nIf all else fails then you can show them the images depicting what a vegan eats and what a vegan does not eat.\n\nWhen booking flights then you can refer to the below airplane meal code to request a vegan meal when booking.\n\nThe Vegan Society is a registered charity and the oldest vegan society in the world, founded on 1 November 1944, in the UK by Donald Watson.\n\nWhat do we want? Simple: a world where humans do not exploit non-human animals. A world where animals are free to exist in their own right. We promote a lifestyle that excludes, as far as possible and practical, all forms of exploitation of - and cruelty to - animals for the purposes of food, clothing or anything else.\n\nWe also want a just world for humans. A world where resources are utilised in a sustainable way to ensure all current and future generations are provided for - a world where no one goes hungry. At the heart of the sustainability and food justice agenda is plant-based food production and consumption: veganism."

      "label": "TrekRight – Camino Francés is a comprehensive, incredibly handy mobile app for anyone walking or bicycling the historic Camino de Santiago (specifically, the Camino Francés and the extension from Santiago to Finisterre / Fisterra). \n\nTrekRight includes an in-depth reference 'Trekopedia' (communities, albergues, attractions, services, points of interest, etc.), supports customizable routes, interactive maps (including detailed *offline* maps), directions and section-by-section guide, dynamic trip stats for your current section, stage, and route, an intelligent compass with a built-in yellow arrow that shows the right direction based on your current location and chosen route, and more.\n\n--- The Right Information, When You Need It ---\nLocation-aware information – TrekRight provides you with information tailored to your current location. If you are approaching Puente la Reina, TrekRight will tell you how far you still have to go, what attractions are available around you, where you can find a water fountain, options for where to stay the night, easy access to interactive elevation profile charts, and clear, detailed directions. You can easily see what things you flagged as interesting, which things you added notes to, and which you marked as favorites. Real-time information that keeps you completely on top of things!\n\n--- Caminopedia ---\nTrekRight’s ‘Camino Encyclopedia’ is packed with extensive interactive reference information, organized into Communities, Shelters, Attractions, Services, Points of Interest, and Route Sections. Everything can be searched and filtered, viewed on a map, notes can be added (anything from a simple reservation number to a copy-and-pasted blurb from a website), and more. Handy information (literally) at your fingertips!\n\n--- Interactive Offline Maps ---\nPowerful, flexible map that displays your current location on your selected route along with pins showing all the locations included in the Caminopedia (just touch a pin to open its related Caminopedia entry). Easily filter and do searches. Detailed, high-quality offline maps are included, so you have full access to maps even without Internet access. When you do have an Internet connection, online maps are also available which can be configured to show street maps, satellite view, terrain, or a hybrid. Completely transform how you ‘see’ your surroundings on the Camino.\n\n--- Intelligent Compass ---\nIn addition to all the standard compass functionality, TrekRight’s intelligent compass also points you in the right direction based on your current location and your selected route, and updates dynamically as you move. Two special compass indicators are available – one points towards the end point of your current section (typically the next town on the route), and the other points which way you should go *now*, taking into consideration your current position and all the twists and turns in your route. Never get lost again!\n\n--- Pre-Camino Planning & Preparation ---\nTrekRight makes it easy to plan your route (including configuring the sections you want to follow), organize it into stages, and review distances and elevations (including a handy interactive Elevation Profile Chart). Comes pre-defined with popular routes including those touted by Brierley and Eroski. Review and rank albergues, flag locations of interest, add your own notes, and more.\n\n--- Up-To-Date Content ---\nTrekRight’s content is regularly updated and expanded based on the latest information available to us. You can check for content updates directly inside TrekRight and download our database whenever it is convenient for you (even on the trail), without having to connect to the App Store. Always be up to date!\n\n--- No Internet Connection Required ---\nAll of TrekRight's content is stored directly on your phone, including our detailed offline maps. No Internet connection is required!"

The database includes over 2000 stations and over 1000 repeaters. My users include avid RVers who roam from region to region and need to locate available TV networks, and homeowners setting up a new antenna system. \n\nApple Watch (Series 5) users can make use of their compass with the optional in-app purchase of an embedded watch app. \n \nThere is an alternate compass tab which shows the direction of stations within a 45 mile radius—given enough screen space—just look over your phone to see which way to point your antenna.\n\nPinch to zoom into your locality, or hit the circular location button to concentrate on local stations. If more than 80 stations are in the area being viewed, a random assortment of 80 stations will be displayed.\n\nThere is no \"phoning home\" with data, personal or not.  If a data connection is available, the FCC servers will be asked for contour plot data when a tower is selected. This will show up as a blue overlay showing the calculated area over which the signal will drop off by at most 35 dBu. Basically, this is the area where an antenna not too near the ground has a chance to receive the signal; your luck will vary. Once downloaded, the data is stored for the next time you select the tower.\n\nErrors and omissions are to be expected especially for stations with low power licenses. Please e-mail the support address if you find a glaring omission or error; I'll need a call sign and a TV network."

Over 900 in total, with special attention to those that can be booked online.\n\nStageless Guide:\nNo more \"stage anxiety\" or guide created bottlenecks.\n\nMaps:  \nOffline and online versions of a beautiful topographical may will give you a good view of the terrain ahead.\n\nPhotos: \nPhotos of albergues, monuments and other points of interest along the way.  Currently 900+ images and growing.\n\nScrollable Elevation Map:  \nThis one is hard to show with just a screenshot, but the elevation that appears at the top of every city page scrolls East to West.  One complete elevation, from St. Jean Pied de Port to Santiago, uninterrupted by page folds.\n\nComments:  \nAlbergue closed early for the season?  Have a restaurant that you want to share, or perhaps one to warn others about?  Every location in the app gives you the opportunity to leave a comment and to read the comments left by others. No registration necessary.\n\n¡Buen Camino and thank you for your support!"

      "label": "•THIS APPLICATION IS FOR DISNEYLAND IN CALIFORNIA. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR DISNEY WORLD IN FLORIDA, CHECK OUT OUR OTHER APPLICATION, HIDDEN MICKEYS: DISNEY WORLD•\n\nThere's an extra special way to enjoy Disneyland and this app is your guide. Hunting for \"Hidden Mickeys\" (images of Mickey Mouse cleverly concealed in DLR's theme parks, restaurants, hotels, and other areas by Disney artists and designers) is fun for all and a bona fide vacation mission for many Disneyland fans. \n\nServing as the OFFICIAL application to Steven Barrett’s bestselling book “Disneyland's Hidden Mickeys – A Field Guide to Disneyland Resort's Best Kept Secrets,” the mouse hunt is taken to a whole new level of interactivity with this application for iPhone and iPod Touch! \n\nUtilizing GPS tracking [iPhone only], your location is scanned and immediately lists the closest Hidden Mickeys to you. If you’re not in the parks, or if you’d rather scroll through the different locations, you are able to browse categorized lists of each Hidden Mickey location. Keep track of which Mickey’s you find with an easy to use built-in scoring system. Keep in mind – this is a scavenger hunt! The score counts if you want it to, so do your best and try to use the least amount of hints as possible. \n\nWhether you’re playing solo or with the whole family, you are able to keep separate user profiles to keep track of everyone’s progress. Spanning both parks and documenting over 480 Hidden Mickeys, this application will add a whole new level of entertainment to your trips to Disneyland! \n\nIn this application you'll discover well over 480 Hidden Mickeys throughout various locations at the Disneyland Resort including: \n• Disneyland Park\n• Disney California Adventure\n• Downtown Disney District\n• Grand Californian Resort and Spa\n• Disneyland Hotel\n• Paradise Pier Hotel\n• And Much More!\n\nPLUS: tips, hints and author Steven Barrett's very own favorite Hidden Mickeys. We've also included the use of Game Center, which allows you gain achievements while playing! We've even hidden a few of these that can only unlock from certain places inside the park - can you get them all?\n\nTrue to their name, Hidden Mickeys are elusive. New ones appear from time to time and some old ones disappear. When that happens — and it will — Steve will let you know on his web site: www.HiddenMickeysGuide.com. Periodically, the application will be updated to reflect these changes, becoming your best source for all things Hidden Mickeys! \n\n“Hidden Mickeys” is based off of the newest and most comprehensive edition of the book. “Disneyland's Hidden Mickeys – A Field Guide to Disneyland Resort's Best Kept Secrets” 5th edition and can be found for sale in stores, or online at Amazon.com."

      "label": "MapCred lets you see where in the world you spend your time, whether it's a neighborhood stroll, a trip to the store, a road trip, or an international vacation. The more time you spend in a location, the \"hotter\" it looks in your heat map. Learn more about your own daily travel habits. Show off your worldly travels. Compare scores with friends via integrated Game Center leaderboards. Don't just unlock new places; revel in your mastery of your own favorite haunts. Be king of your block. Queen of QFC. Prince of Popeye's.\n\n● VISUALIZE YOUR TRAVELS, BIG AND SMALL\n\nMapCred captures your daily travels automatically and puts them in vivid colors on your personal map. Passing through an area makes it blue. Pausing for a minute in that spot turns it green. Stay put for a cup of coffee or a nice meal and you'll gain yellow territory. Spend more than an hour in an area and it goes red to demonstrate your mastery.\n\n● BEAUTIFUL MAPS, BEAUTIFUL LIFE\n\nGorgeous high-resolution maps of the world serve as the canvas for your own personal heat map. Want to take the path less traveled? Visit an interesting shop along your daily commute? Explore new neighborhoods? MapCred empowers you to wander like a pro. There's no wrong answer!\n\n● FULLY AUTOMATED\n\nMapCred runs efficiently in the background to build your personal map while you go about your daily business. The app uses geofencing and intelligent backoff to preserve battery life while journaling your movements around planet Earth down to an incredible 1 meter resolution! On the off chance iOS decides to close the app, MapCred will send you a notification reminding you to launch again.\n\n● GAME CENTER LEADERBOARDS\n\nIf you're feeling competitive, optionally compare your high scores with friends via Game Center, Apple's built-in gaming hub. See who's got the most Blue, Green, Yellow, and Red territory. Earn cred with your map mastery.\n\n● IMPORT FROM FOG OF WORLD\n\nFog of World users can seamlessly import their progress into MapCred anytime and continue where they left off. So it's easy to join the MapCred community as a seasoned traveler. If you change your mind, you can always undo previous imports while preserving your natively-journaled trips.\n\n● OPEN DATA FORMAT\n\nYour travels belong to you. Export all your journaled and imported data anytime, as often as you want. MapCred can export in industry-standard GPX format as well as simple CSV text files. Switch apps anytime without losing progress. \n\n● PRIVATE AND SECURE\n\nYour personal map is yours and only yours. All location data is stored locally on your iPhone or iPad only. Nothing is sent to us (heck, we don't even have servers). Don't worry; if you choose to use Game Center, only your score is shared; not your location.\n\nMapCred uses your location in the background to update your personal map, even when you're doing other things with your phone. As you move around the world or spend time at a restaurant, business, or home, MapCred journals your progress so you can gain points and visualize your day later on. Your location is only used by the app locally on your phone; it is never transmitted off your phone to us or anyone else.\n\nMapCred uses notifications for only one purpose: To let you know if the app stopped running in the background, so you can restart it and not lose any progress. We will never push a notification for any other purpose. \n\n● WHY MAPCRED?\n\nWe're huge fans of mapping apps such as Fog of World and Strut. If you haven't tried them, please do. This is a different take on the \"uncover the world\" model. When you're traveling the world, those apps are lots of fun. You can show off your stuff. But when you're out getting groceries, or getting a car wash, or going for a jog, you might also want to feel like you're getting a little cred. MapCred is for people like us. Whether you're watering your lawn or visiting the Taj Mahal, MapCred will make you feel like you're a winner. \n\nAlso, it's way cheaper."

This same data is part of the \"Camp and RV\" app which has a dump station filter in it.\n\nRV Dumps checks your location and displays up to 150 points on a map view. You can filter by type to see only what you want to see on the map and zoom out. You can also use the offline manual lookup to find locations by type, state and city...even when you have no phone service!\n\nRV Dumps takes the database from the top ranked camping app called Camp & RV and filters all points that have a dump station as an amenity (not \"hookups\" which are at a site. Many parks no longer have stand alone stations.) Maybe you need one and a night stop or you are just passing on through. From Rest Areas to truck stops to private campgrounds (either stay the night or call to see if you can pay a separate fee). From State Parks to even some National Park and Forest campgrounds that have one.\n\nDump stations are being paved over left and right these days. We removed several each day that are found to be closed. Please send in reports and adds. I have hundreds more dump locations that I don't have GPS points for so they can't be placed in the mobile app yet. I keep working on those.\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Search for specific locations around you on a map.\n- One-touch calling for places that have a phone number listed. Good idea to call and ask about the fees as Flying J now charges for it.\n- One-touch turn-by-turn directions for all POIs.\n- Works when iPhone has no phone service.\n- Supports a manual lookup mode where users can look up parks and truck stops that have RV dumps.\n\nUpdates make major changes that early app reviews won't reflect. We added thousands of places like waste water treatment plants, dealerships, gas stations, public places, storage places and stores."

IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR DISNEYLAND IN CALIFORNIA, CHECK OUT OUR OTHER APP \"HIDDEN MICKEYS: DISNEYLAND\"•\n\nThere's an extra special way to enjoy Walt Disney World and this app is your guide. Hunting for \"Hidden Mickeys\" (images of Mickey Mouse cleverly concealed in WDW's theme parks, restaurants, hotels, and other areas by Disney artists and designers) is fun for all and a bona fide vacation mission for many Disney World fans.\n\nServing as the OFFICIAL application to Steven Barrett’s bestselling book “Hidden Mickeys – A Field Guide to Walt Disney World's Best Kept Secrets,” the mouse hunt is taken to a whole new level of interactivity with this application for iPhone and iPod Touch! \n\nUtilizing GPS tracking [iPhone only], your location is scanned and immediately lists the closest Hidden Mickeys to you. If you’re not in the parks, or if you’d rather scroll through the different locations, you are able to browse categorized lists of each Hidden Mickey location. Keep track of which Mickey’s you find with an easy to use built-in scoring system. Keep in mind – this is a scavenger hunt! The score counts if you want it to, so do your best and try to use the least amount of hints as possible.\n\nWhether you’re playing solo or with the whole family, you are able to keep separate user profiles to keep track of everyone’s progress. Spanning all four parks and documenting over 1200 Hidden Mickeys, this application will add a whole new level of entertainment to your trips to Disney World!\n\nIn this application you'll discover well over 1200 Hidden Mickeys throughout various locations at the Walt Disney World Resort including:\n• Magic Kingdom Park \n• Epcot\n• Disney's Hollywood Studios\n• Disney’s Animal Kingdom\n• Blizzard Beach & Typhoon Lagoon Water Parks\n• Disney Springs\n• EPSN Wide World of Sports\n• Miniature Golf Courses\n• Over 20 DIFFERENT Disney Hotels\n\nPLUS: tips, hints and author Steven Barrett's very own favorite Hidden Mickeys. We've also included the use of Game Center, which allows you gain achievements while playing! We've even hidden a few of these that can only unlock from certain places inside the park - can you get them all?\n\nTrue to their name, Hidden Mickeys are elusive. New ones appear from time to time and some old ones disappear. When that happens — and it will — Steve will let you know on his web site: www.HiddenMickeysGuide.com. Periodically, the application will be updated to reflect these changes, becoming your best source for all things Hidden Mickeys!\n\n“Hidden Mickeys” is based off of the newest and most comprehensive edition of the book. “Hidden Mickeys – A Field Guide to Walt Disney World's Best Kept Secrets” 8th edition can be found for sale throughout Disney World, in stores, or online at Amazon.com."

      "label": "Do you have favorite hotel chains? This universal app makes it easy to find chain locations nearest you (or far away). With or without service. No waiting for data, ads or being thrown in a queue.\n\nPlease read to know why this app is unique.\n\n- This is a independent app that is like no other. It is about choice, not deals.\n\n- REAL hotel phone numbers. The data is on the app so you don't have to wait or hunt for phone numbers.\n\n- REAL website links directly to each property.\n\n- You book direct over the phone or their official website, NOT the app. The app does not do booking and you are not queued up overseas by a third party.\n\n- Easily find favorite chains with map filters or a manual lookup by chain. Like our website, no one else lets you find Ritz-Carltons or Motel 6 together. The choice is yours.\n\n- Filter by brand umbrella. Prefer to gets points at only Marriott brands? Hyatt? Choice? See just the overall group you want.\n\n- Filter by amenity. Look for a pool, restaurant, internet, fitness center, business center, extended stays, pet friendly or truck/bus parking.\n\n- Includes a independent category that has many hotels and motels you won't find in other apps.\n\n- No ads inside the app or corporate deals to throw certain brands at you and hide others.\n\n- We are not making money on every booking like other apps do. No preferred brands to push on you.\n\n- This app is universal for all iOS devices. Most locators are not.\n\n- Find the nearest ones to you right now on the map view. Tap the compass button to re-center around you at anytime. You don't need a zipcode.\n\n- Planning ahead for other places? Type a city in the search box and jump there on the map.\n\n- No service to display maps? Use the in-app manual lookup. This is a big reason. Other hotel apps always require internet service. When you want to find something, you want to find it fast no matter what.\n\n- Tap a location for more information such as distance from your current location, phone number, address, directions, important amenities and the official website, photo search and review search.\n\n- Easily report errors, changes, closures or post important comments from each locations detail view.\n\n- It does not do everything that other apps already do. This is for when you know the type of hotel that you want and you just want to find it fast.\n\nFor all features and best results, a GPS enabled device is recommended but this is designed to run on all devices. The data is stored locally on your device. Using the manual lookup button, you can find places by state and city without internet service. You can list all places or just one preferred location.\n\nThis data is USA only right now.\n\nThis app is completely ad and sponsor free but you can connect to the official websites of the hotel companies and reviews. THEY may have ads on them and we don't control those companies and how they present their own data.\n\nAllStays LLC is a independent travel site that lists all types of lodging."

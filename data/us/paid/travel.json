And you won’t need to worry about photoshopping the Rainbow Eucalyptus at the Ke’anae Arboretum or the stunning contrast between blue water and black lava rock at Ke’anae Peninsular.\n\nTake a moment to cool off with a quick swim at the pristine Hamoa Beach and see where Haleakala National Park descends from the summit to the sea and the “Seven Sacred Pools” of Oheo at the end of the drive.\n\nWith such a long day of exploring (expect 8-12 hours), it’s important to know the 5 “not to be missed” stops, and the many more suggestions if you have time.  Part of the secret to enjoying the journey is knowing how not to waste your time, and we have tips for that as well.\n\nOn the return drive from Hana, we’ll point out the not to be missed stops again as well as tell you stories about Hawaii’s fascinating history and rich culture.\n\nPlease note Highway #31 ‘backside route’ is not recommended for driving. Rental car insurance void.   Road can be closed for repairs, mudslides and flash floods.\n  \nWHAT YOU’LL SEE:\n\nSome of the highlights along the route include;\n\n•\tHo’okipa Beach Park\n•\tPaia\n•\tKe’anae Peninsular\n•\tWai’anapanapa Park, Black Sand Beach\n•\tHana\n•\tHamoa Beach\n•\tWailua Falls\n•\tTwin Falls\n•\tUpper Waikanai Falls (3 Bears)\n•\tPools of O’heo (Seven Sacred Pools)\n•\tPipiwai Bamboo Trail\n\n**Reservations to visit Wai'anapanapa State Park and black sand beach are now mandatory** \n\n\nBATTERY USAGE:\n++  Continued use of GPS/Location Services in the background increases battery usage.  We strongly recommend taking a cigarette style (DC outlet) car charger.  Avoid using a direct connection to the USB port of a rental vehicle.\n\nIPADS:\n** iPad models must include a GPS chip. Please note that Apple only install these on the iPad Wifi + Cellular models.  Wifi only iPad models have limited location service capabilities and are unable to play commentary automatically.\n\nDOWNLOADING:\nThe apps are larger in size in order to work offline.  You must be on wifi to download as the store may block the download over cellular networks.  \n\nABOUT US:\n\nGyPSy Guide™ produce award winning narrated audio tours along scenic drives and road trips around the world.  \n\nEnjoyed by travelers who prefer to set their own pace and itinerary on vacation, but enjoy a fun, informative and educational guided experience while driving themselves.  \n\nOur goal is to provide a great introduction to the region and inspire you to learn more and return.  \n\nNone of our apps include paid advertising or placements for benefit"

Get Airborne.\n\nOr access LOCAL INFO--before you depart, just after arrival--anytime. \n\nMilSpaceA app allows authorized U.S. government users to register for Department of Defense (DoD) military space-available travel. It is the exclusive app for all DoD travelers wanting a quick, easy, reliable, and authorized means to sign up for Space-A at primary departure terminals. \n\nVISITING FAMILY MEMBERS and TDY military & contractors are now using MilSpaceA app as well--there's MUCH MORE here than just space-a signup.\n\nExpanded LOCAL INFO: billeting, car rental, dining, Exchange info, links to air terminals' pages, USOs, & more.\nAIRCRAFT GALLERY: depictions & basic descriptions of DoD pax aircraft\nTRAVEL ADVISORIES - announcements of temporary conditions affecting space-a\nSIGNUP ARCHIVE - stored in-app (as well as in user's own e-mail \"Sent\" items)\nFOREIGN CURRENCY - daily exchange rates for AOIs\nDOCUMENT LIBRARY:  key space-a documents:  policy, guides, handbooks, AMCGrams\nENHANCED ONLINE MAPPING: Your location shown relative to points of interest in the app (requires active geolocation & Internet access). \n\nFirst, browse through \"Airfields of Interest\".  Call ahead to various terminals (call-enabled for iPhone) or visit terminals’ flight schedule pages (if they have them--most don't). Then fill in your details, select departure airfields and destination countries, and send out the signup to register for travel. Some terminals will reply; most will not. Just keep a copy of e-mail(s) as proof of signup.\n\n• Remote space-a signup for multiple airfields. Prepare off- or online--then transmit when you have connectivity.\n• Multi-branch terminal support (Air Force, Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, Guard & Reserve)\n• Complies with Air Mobility Command rules: Signups generated by you, your e-mail as the sender & reply-to address. Copies saved directly in your e-mail Sent items, retrievable anytime.\n• Data privacy: No SSAN required. Exclusive AMC-authorized Pseudo Person ID (PPID) auto-created. (Some Navy locations still insist on SSANs--contact them directly after signup to pass SSAN).  \n• NEW: Now includes optional fields for DoD ID numbers, dates of birth, and passport info.\n• Full control of your data--ability to purge anytime.\n\n***\n\"My mom came to visit me and she used the app, too (...) It's great for anyone visiting [the base].\" - LT\n\"Amazing how easy this app made our trip. This and our books together, because weird or not, I still like the smell of paper\" - JD\n\"Great app. Very easy to use\" - TT\n***\n\nPolicies governing space-a are implemented in DoD Directive 4515.13-R (Air Transportation Eligibility) and AMCI 24-101 Vol 14. Determine your eligibility before registering for travel. CONTACT YOUR LOCAL TERMINAL if you have any questions of eligibility. Refer to http://www.amc.af.mil/amctravel for current official AMC policy. Utilize and support pepperd.com, spacea.net & takeahop.org for unofficial discussions, info, and desktop-based space-a signup.\n\nOnly after mission requirements are met will remaining seats be offered up for space-a. Be prepared for delays or short-notice diversions. Space-A is a privilege, not a right--movement is never guaranteed. UNDERSTAND THE BASICS OF SPACE-A before signing up.\n\nMore about Take-a-Hop--and its MilSpaceA app)\n\nSince inception, Take-a-Hop's platform has generated MILLIONS of space-a signups. Trusted by passengers and passenger service agents (PSAs) alike. Used by tens of thousands of DoD travelers. Solely managed by a USAF veteran who has also traveled military space-a and knows what travelers are up against. MilSpaceA app is not endorsed by the US Federal Government, DoD, or any branch thereof. And still, it's the name recommended by thousands and earning your trust for years.\n\nThanks and Happy Travels!\n\nWEB at www.takeahop.com/app\nLIKE on www.facebook.com/takeahop"

      "label": "The US Federal Governments owns nearly 650 million acres of land - almost 30 percent of the land area of the United States.\n\nThese are lands that are held for all Americans.\n\nUS Public Lands allows you to quickly retrieve the boundaries of these properties without carrying physical maps, books, or digging deep online.\n\nIncluded in the app are on-device (fully works offline), individually selectable & beautifully colored map layers for most of the properties administered by the federal government:\n\n- Bureau of Land Management (BLM)\n- US Forest Service (FS)\n- National Park Service (NPS)\n- Army Corp of Engineers (ACOE)\n- US Fish & Wildlife Service\n- Bureau of Reclamation\n- Tennessee Valley Authority\n- Department of Defense (military bases & installations)\n- Other (National Laboratories, Test Sites, etc...)\n\nKey Benefits & Features\n\n- Know which US agency owns and operates the land you're on or are heading to. Use the \"Layers\" icon to select which agencies you want displayed to create your own custom map. (Hint, the toggles are color coded to the color each layer is displayed in.)\n\n- Links are provided to each agency's website within the app, so that you can further your research as to what land use rules apply for each public land type - such as permits, fees, activities allowed, and limits of stay.\n\n- Map layers are stored on device - no internet connection required.\n\n- Be sure to turn on the 'Basic' base map to see the US Public Land labels for each land area. This base map layer is also stored entirely on your device, and can be utilized if you do not have an internet connection or would like to conserve bandwidth. \n\n- If you have an internet connection (or have cached them before going out of signal), you can utilize the built in Apple Maps and satellite view maps as the base layer underneath the public land overlays.\n\n- A boondocker's assistant - While US Public Lands is not specifically a camp site locator and does not have a database of specific sites, by turning on the satellite view map, you can better scout out trails, roads and signs of dispersed camping locations within the boundaries of the public land resources. \n\n- Quickly toggle between 'Show' and 'Hide' via the \"Map\" icon to more clearly see satellite images below.\n\n- If you have GPS access on your device, click the 'Locate Me' icon to show your present location - know what type of land you're on right now!\n\n- Built in search tool locates anything on device maps supports (requires internet access) - including cities, states, zip codes, addresses and points of interest. A pin is dropped at the search location.\n\n\nThank you to the Protected Area Database (PAD-US) of the U.S. Geological Survey for providing the public domain raw map data that we’ve been able to utilize to create this interactive overlayable mapping & navigation tool. We will update our maps in the future to stay in sync with improvements to this data set. \n\nPlease note, the USGS PAD-US database contains the “most up-to-date aggregation of Federal lands and waters” available, but this database is still evolving and some locations may not be listed and others may not have precisely accurate boundaries. Resolution across the nation may vary. And always remember - there may be private unmapped inholdings within any public lands - so always pay attention to local signage, indications, and information. \n\nThe US Public Lands app should only be used as an overview, and you should always confirm more precise details by consulting local field offices, administration websites, and other resources. Do not solely rely on this app for determining if you are on public or private land."

List only free dump stations from the filter.\n- Show a route between your location and the selected RV dump station.\n- View the dump stations in list view; easily search the list.\n- Get the local weather for the location.\n- Internet searches and more for each location.\n- Import routes from GPX files.  This makes it much easier to find RV dump stations along a route you've created in another app such as Road Trip Planner.\n- Send a dump station location to our app Road Trip Planner.  This helps in routing your travels (requires separate purchase of the Road Trip Planner app).\n\nWe want to expand our RV dump station database as much as possible, so we have made it easy for you to easily submit a new RV dump station - simply tap the + button below the map.  To correct or update dump station information, tap “Location Comment” in the detail view. We will be updating the database often.\n\nDue to the nature of dump stations constantly changing their status it's recommended you contact the dump station prior to using it to verify its existence."

      "label": "•THIS APPLICATION IS FOR DISNEY WORLD IN FLORIDA. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR DISNEYLAND IN CALIFORNIA, CHECK OUT OUR OTHER APP \"HIDDEN MICKEYS: DISNEYLAND\"•\n\nThere's an extra special way to enjoy Walt Disney World and this app is your guide. Hunting for \"Hidden Mickeys\" (images of Mickey Mouse cleverly concealed in WDW's theme parks, restaurants, hotels, and other areas by Disney artists and designers) is fun for all and a bona fide vacation mission for many Disney World fans.\n\nServing as the OFFICIAL application to Steven Barrett’s bestselling book “Hidden Mickeys – A Field Guide to Walt Disney World's Best Kept Secrets,” the mouse hunt is taken to a whole new level of interactivity with this application for iPhone and iPod Touch! \n\nUtilizing GPS tracking [iPhone only], your location is scanned and immediately lists the closest Hidden Mickeys to you. If you’re not in the parks, or if you’d rather scroll through the different locations, you are able to browse categorized lists of each Hidden Mickey location. Keep track of which Mickey’s you find with an easy to use built-in scoring system. Keep in mind – this is a scavenger hunt! The score counts if you want it to, so do your best and try to use the least amount of hints as possible.\n\nWhether you’re playing solo or with the whole family, you are able to keep separate user profiles to keep track of everyone’s progress. Spanning all four parks and documenting over 1200 Hidden Mickeys, this application will add a whole new level of entertainment to your trips to Disney World!\n\nIn this application you'll discover well over 1200 Hidden Mickeys throughout various locations at the Walt Disney World Resort including:\n• Magic Kingdom Park \n• Epcot\n• Disney's Hollywood Studios\n• Disney’s Animal Kingdom\n• Blizzard Beach & Typhoon Lagoon Water Parks\n• Disney Springs\n• EPSN Wide World of Sports\n• Miniature Golf Courses\n• Over 20 DIFFERENT Disney Hotels\n\nPLUS: tips, hints and author Steven Barrett's very own favorite Hidden Mickeys. We've also included the use of Game Center, which allows you gain achievements while playing! We've even hidden a few of these that can only unlock from certain places inside the park - can you get them all?\n\nTrue to their name, Hidden Mickeys are elusive. New ones appear from time to time and some old ones disappear. When that happens — and it will — Steve will let you know on his web site: www.HiddenMickeysGuide.com. Periodically, the application will be updated to reflect these changes, becoming your best source for all things Hidden Mickeys!\n\n“Hidden Mickeys” is based off of the newest and most comprehensive edition of the book. “Hidden Mickeys – A Field Guide to Walt Disney World's Best Kept Secrets” 8th edition can be found for sale throughout Disney World, in stores, or online at Amazon.com."

      "label": "MapCred lets you see where in the world you spend your time, whether it's a neighborhood stroll, a trip to the store, a road trip, or an international vacation. The more time you spend in a location, the \"hotter\" it looks in your heat map. Learn more about your own daily travel habits. Show off your worldly travels. Compare scores with friends via integrated Game Center leaderboards. Don't just unlock new places; revel in your mastery of your own favorite haunts. Be king of your block. Queen of QFC. Prince of Popeye's.\n\n● VISUALIZE YOUR TRAVELS, BIG AND SMALL\n\nMapCred captures your daily travels automatically and puts them in vivid colors on your personal map. Passing through an area makes it blue. Pausing for a minute in that spot turns it green. Stay put for a cup of coffee or a nice meal and you'll gain yellow territory. Spend more than an hour in an area and it goes red to demonstrate your mastery.\n\n● BEAUTIFUL MAPS, BEAUTIFUL LIFE\n\nGorgeous high-resolution maps of the world serve as the canvas for your own personal heat map. Want to take the path less traveled? Visit an interesting shop along your daily commute? Explore new neighborhoods? MapCred empowers you to wander like a pro. There's no wrong answer!\n\n● FULLY AUTOMATED\n\nMapCred runs efficiently in the background to build your personal map while you go about your daily business. The app uses geofencing and intelligent backoff to preserve battery life while journaling your movements around planet Earth down to an incredible 1 meter resolution! On the off chance iOS decides to close the app, MapCred will send you a notification reminding you to launch again.\n\n● GAME CENTER LEADERBOARDS\n\nIf you're feeling competitive, optionally compare your high scores with friends via Game Center, Apple's built-in gaming hub. See who's got the most Blue, Green, Yellow, and Red territory. Earn cred with your map mastery.\n\n● IMPORT FROM FOG OF WORLD\n\nFog of World users can seamlessly import their progress into MapCred anytime and continue where they left off. So it's easy to join the MapCred community as a seasoned traveler. If you change your mind, you can always undo previous imports while preserving your natively-journaled trips.\n\n● OPEN DATA FORMAT\n\nYour travels belong to you. Export all your journaled and imported data to simple CSV files anytime, as often as you want. Switch apps anytime without losing progress. \n\n● PRIVATE AND SECURE\n\nYour personal map is yours and only yours. All location data is stored locally on your iPhone or iPad only. Nothing is sent to us (heck, we don't even have servers). Don't worry; if you choose to use Game Center, only your score is shared; not your location.\n\nMapCred uses your location in the background to update your personal map, even when you're doing other things with your phone. As you move around the world or spend time at a restaurant, business, or home, MapCred journals your progress so you can gain points and visualize your day later on. Your location is only used by the app locally on your phone; it is never transmitted off your phone to us or anyone else.\n\nMapCred uses notifications for only one purpose: To let you know if the app stopped running in the background, so you can restart it and not lose any progress. We will never push a notification for any other purpose. \n\n● WHY MAPCRED?\n\nWe're huge fans of mapping apps such as Fog of World and Strut. If you haven't tried them, please do. This is a different take on the \"uncover the world\" model. When you're traveling the world, those apps are lots of fun. You can show off your stuff. But when you're out getting groceries, or getting a car wash, or going for a jog, you might also want to feel like you're getting a little cred. MapCred is for people like us. Whether you're watering your lawn or visiting the Taj Mahal, MapCred will make you feel like you're a winner. \n\nAlso, it's way cheaper."

      "label": "MetroBuddy is your subway ride's best friend. In cities like New York where you have to swipe your transit card to unlock the turnstile, forgetting your balance and being greeted by an \"insufficient funds\" message can be annoying, and delay your journey.\n\nMetroBuddy lets you enter your current MetroCard balance, and update it each time you swipe. Never lose time at the MetroCard reader again, your balance will always be available on your phone! The app also calculates how many rides you have left, based on your fare. Use the History tab to review the changes you made to your balance.\n\nMetroBuddy also provides Siri shortcuts to record a swipe and check your balance. This enables you to build powerful automation for your commute, such as recording a swipe, starting your favorite playlist, and checking the next train departure.\n\nIf you are using iOS 14 or later, you can add a widget to your home screen or your widget center to view your balance even faster.\n\nWe are proud to be working on making MetroBuddy as inclusive as possible. You can change your fare if you have a more affordable one. The app is also fully compatible with iOS assistive technologies such as VoiceOver, Dynamic Type, and VoiceControl. Turnstiles are not fully accessible, but MetroBuddy is.\n\nDo not hesitate to reach out with feedback and/or questions by e-mail at hi@alexisonline.dev.\n\nPlease note that MetroBuddy is a hobby app and is not affiliated with New York's MTA in any way."

      "label": "- Rated \"Excellent\" by Wired Magazine\n- As seen in \"Harvard Business Review\"\n\nThe store founder was an RVer and the general policy remains that RVers can spend one night free in a store parking lot. You get some rest, maybe shop a bit and move on early in the morning.\n\nHow will this app help you? RVer or not, this app shows all Walmart locations in US and Canada. Use it to find shopping now and for RVing later.\n\nWant to know where every Walmart is located and which ones have been reported to allow and don't allow overnight parking?\n\nFilter map to see if has fuel, pharmacy, garden center, a restaurant and much more.\n\nThis app plots every Walmart store in the USA and Canada on the map view. It uses location services to find your location and as you move.\n\nLocal influence and RVer abuse have meant that about 1/4 of stores no longer allow overnights, so you might want ask a manager ahead of time. Please submit your reports to us so we can keep this app accurate. I get numerous reports about stores every single day. It’s always changing...\n\nWhat's in it: Walmart's of all kinds. Can you park there or have others been denied or even towed? Tips are provided from other RVers as to where to park in the lot. \n\nIt integrates nicely with maps to display up to 150 points of interest on a map.\n\nDon’t take even one more trip without Walmart Overnight Parking. It can always change by the time you get there but at least you can be aware of what others have experienced lately.\n\nAllstays LLC, the provider of this App is not affiliated with, sponsored by or in any way related to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.

All updates are free.\n\nNow in their 11th year as a mobile app, and their 13th online, the Wise Pilgrim Guides are the go-to source of up-to-date information on the Camino de Santiago.\n\nThe app is updated regularly with new content and new features and offers you the ability to leave tips for pilgrims following behind you.\n\nThis guide covers the Camino Portugués and its three most common variations; the Central Route, the Coastal Route, and the Variante Espiritual. It has been redesigned and now works almost exclusively offline (to share your comments with others will require a data connection).  As more an more albergues share their WiFi this becomes less of an issue, and the guide will tell you which ones offer WiFi.\n\nAccommodation Directory:  \nA full directory of Albergues, camping, hotels, pensions, paradors, and cases rurales.  Over 400 in total, with special attention to those that can be booked online.\n\nStageless Guide:\nNo more \"stage anxiety\" or guide created bottlenecks.\n\nMaps:  \nOffline and online versions of a beautiful topographical may will give you a good view of the terrain ahead.\n\nPhotos: \nPhotos of albergues, monuments and other points of interest along the way.  Currently 400+ images and growing.\n\nScrollable Elevation Map:  \nThis one is hard to show with just a screenshot, but the elevation that appears at the top of every city page scrolls East to West.  One complete elevation, from St. Jean Pied de Port to Santiago, uninterrupted by page folds.\n\nComments:  \nAlbergue closed early for the season?  Have a restaurant that you want to share, or perhaps one to warn others about?  Every location in the app gives you the opportunity to leave a comment and to read the comments left by others. No registration necessary.\n\n¡Buen Camino and thank you for your support!"

      "label": "Love exploring Joshua Tree but hate that you can't get a cell signal in the park, making it nearly impossible to find the best sights? Well, today's your lucky day!\n\nIntroducing our new offline Joshua Tree National Park (and surrounding areas) photo guide. Now you can get all the great photos, content, and exact locations that you already love in Fotospot, but with one big difference - offline maps! When you have a working WiFi connection, simply download our offline guide to your device and, like magic, the app will now work when you don't have an internet connection. You'll be able to check in, save attractions for later, add new photos, and - best of all - find the exact locations of all the coolest Joshua Tree spots including Heart Rock, Lost Horse Mine, Barker Dam, and Skull Rock - all without having a working cell signal!\n\nPlease note, some of these attractions can be found in our flagship app, Fotospot, but with two huge differences:\n\n1. Exclusive Content \nSome of the coolest (and hardest to find) attractions can only be found here like the Iron Door Cave, Penguin Rock, Eagle Cliff Boulder House, Samuelson Rocks, the Freak Brothers, and Garrett's Arch (the largest arch in the park!), plus a ton more.\n\n2. Offline Maps\nUnlike Fotospot, our Joshua Tree photo guide works even when you don't have a working cell signal (and that's basically the entire park).\n\nOne-time payment:\nWe don't have any upsells, in-app purchases, or subscriptions in this app, so for a simple one-time purchase, all of this can be yours for life. Plus, you'll automatically get any new future attractions we add to the app for FREE!\n\nLeave no trace:\nWhen visiting any attraction (in our app or not) please be responsible and leave it exactly how you found it. Take only photos and leave only footprints. To learn more please visit LNT.org.\n\nHappy exploring,\nThe Fotospot Team\n\n#fotospotting\n#fotospotapp"

      "label": "Nolli for iPhone and iPad brings one of the greatest maps of all time to your smartphone: the great plan of Rome by Giambattista Nolli, originally published in 1748. An app to discover the city from the inside and to surprise you. An app to both lose and find yourself in Rome.\n\nNavigate the Rome of today with this eternal map, that is surprisingly still very valid for the historical center. See more than others, enjoying the fine detail and clear handcrafted graphics of this masterpiece of mapping.\n\nGo into the right direction with this app and you will discover a lot of interesting things that might not have caught your attention using a different map.\n\nThe app allows for using the map in high resolution, also offline without internet connection, in free browsing mode and in follow-me mode. All points of interest from the 2 original indices (alphabetical by category and spatial by number) have been georeferenced and are contained in the app (more than 1400) with their corresponding data (name, typological class, Rione, etc). With the search you can find all features from the indices and all text labels on the plan (more than 600).\n\nIn designing the present edition of the \"Nuova Topografia di Roma\" (New Topography of Rome, 12 sheets at a scale of 1:2900) and indices of the \"Nuova Pianta di Roma\" (New Map of Rome, index to the plan and diminished maps) we have spent great care with the aim to be as close to the original as possible regarding the labeling and the structure of the directories.\n\nTherefore the app reproduces in the indices on the left side of the map exactly those types in the exact order and (to the contemporary reader occasionally appearing outmoded) notation as provided by Giambattista Nolli in his indices. By selecting an entry you will be led to the corresponding location on the map. You can also browse by tapping on one of the numbers on the map to see what it is about.\n\nThe explanations of the signatures and line styles, hatches and selected abbreviations are reproduced in their original form (see \"Legend\"). You can access Nolli's original spelling of the indices, legend, and other signs at the bottom of the English version in Italian language.\n\nThe map itself has been georeferenced and in its projection adapted to that of popular web maps to make it usable with your mobile device, thereby enabling the exciting comparison of today's Rome with that of Nolli's times (mid-18th century).\n\nWe hope you enjoy the electronic edition of this milestone in the history of cartography!"

      "label": "Where's the closest RV Dump station at a campground, a rest area, a truck stop, a water treatment plant?\n\nRV Dumps knows these things. And you can easily know too. This same data is part of the \"Camp and RV\" app which has a dump station filter in it.\n\nRV Dumps checks your location and displays up to 150 points on a map view. You can filter by type to see only what you want to see on the map and zoom out. You can also use the offline manual lookup to find locations by type, state and city...even when you have no phone service!\n\nRV Dumps takes the database from the top ranked camping app called Camp & RV and filters all points that have a dump station as an amenity (not \"hookups\" which are at a site. Many parks no longer have stand alone stations.) Maybe you need one and a night stop or you are just passing on through. From Rest Areas to truck stops to private campgrounds (either stay the night or call to see if you can pay a separate fee). From State Parks to even some National Park and Forest campgrounds that have one.\n\nDump stations are being paved over left and right these days. We removed several each day that are found to be closed. Please send in reports and adds. I have hundreds more dump locations that I don't have GPS points for so they can't be placed in the mobile app yet. I keep working on those.\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Search for specific locations around you on a map.\n- One-touch calling for places that have a phone number listed. Good idea to call and ask about the fees as Flying J now charges for it.\n- One-touch turn-by-turn directions for all POIs.\n- Works when iPhone has no phone service.\n- Supports a manual lookup mode where users can look up parks and truck stops that have RV dumps.\n\nUpdates make major changes that early app reviews won't reflect. We added thousands of places like waste water treatment plants, dealerships, gas stations, public places, storage places and stores."

The database includes over 2000 stations and over 1000 repeaters. My users include avid RVers who roam from region to region and need to locate available TV networks, and homeowners setting up a new antenna system. \n\nApple Watch (Series 5) users can make use of their compass with the optional in-app purchase of an embedded watch app. \n \nThere is an alternate compass tab which shows the direction of stations within a 45 mile radius—given enough screen space—just look over your phone to see which way to point your antenna.\n\nPinch to zoom into your locality, or hit the circular location button to concentrate on local stations. If more than 80 stations are in the area being viewed, a random assortment of 80 stations will be displayed.\n\nThere is no \"phoning home\" with data, personal or not.  If a data connection is available, the FCC servers will be asked for contour plot data when a tower is selected. This will show up as a blue overlay showing the calculated area over which the signal will drop off by at most 35 dBu. Basically, this is the area where an antenna not too near the ground has a chance to receive the signal; your luck will vary. Once downloaded, the data is stored for the next time you select the tower.\n\nErrors and omissions are to be expected especially for stations with low power licenses.

      "label": "eCurrency is far more than an easy to use currency converter and handy calculator. It supports over 200 popular currencies; works without active internet connection and even supports custom rates. eCurrency offers rich graphical charts for all exchange rates and supports calculations with historical exchange rates, making this the perfect tool for business, overseas travel and for anyone interested in currency trading.\n\neCurrency offers the following features:\n\n► Easy-to-use appealing interface\n► One screen for all major functionalities\n► Designated keypad for fast number entry; plus a handy built-in math’s calculator\n► Configures up to 8 converters; swipe through as on the iPhone‘s home screen\n► Supports over 200 currencies (for a full list see: http://bit.ly/knBkeS)\n► Detailed graphical charts for all exchange rates (1-week, 1-month, 3-months, 6-months, 1-year, 2-years, and 5-years)\n► Automatic setting of home currency and number formatting \n► Reliable functionality: No active internet connection required\n► Exchange rates automatically updated on startup (Automatic update can be deactivated to avoid roaming costs)\n► Supports custom exchange rate entry\n► One touch reverse currency conversion\n► Special ‘shake to inverse calculation’ feature\n► Select and create a list of preferred currencies for fast access\n\n\n==Easy to use interface==\neCurrency interface is designed for ease of use. Just start the application and type in the amount you want to convert and eCurrency converts instantly. Tap on one of the flags to change the currency you want to convert to. A built-in calculator allows for math calculations. The current exchange rate and rate change compared to the previous day is conveniently displayed in the main interface.\n\n==Favorites Support==\neCurrency supports over 200 currencies. The “Favorites” functionality allows you to define the currency pairs you use as favorites. To create a new favorite go into the “Settings” and touch the “+” Button.

      "label": "Twiz puts the fun in functionality!  Simply pick a starting location (where you are) and then pick the place you want to get to.  Mr. Wizard will promptly make fun suggestions about how to get there using Transportation.  Mr. Wizard also estimates how long it will take to get there..  By tapping on the route, you get lots of helpful tips about the transportation system and you can share your experience of times and tips with other users.\n\nImagine you are on your first trip to the Grand Floridian.  You arrive at your hotel, unpack your bags and call your friends who happen to be staying at the Boardwalk Inn.  You decide you want to meet for dinner at the Flying Fish café… but you don’t have a car, and you have no idea how to get to the Boardwalk from the Grand Floridian.  You whip out your iPhone and the WDW Transportation Wizard comes to your rescue; promptly suggesting several routes involving boats, buses, or monorails.  He even tells you how long it’s likely to take so you won’t be late for dinner.  Thank you Mr Wizard!\n\nOr, perhaps you are a veteran of Disneyworld and love planning daily itineraries.  You plan your trip, making a careful schedule of where to eat and which parks to go to when.  You decide that a fun day at the Hollywood Studios would really be nicely topped off by dinner at Chefs de France.  But how long is it going to take to get there, and what is the funnest possible route (this is a vacation after all!)?  You pop out your iPhone and fire up the OLP WDW Transportation Wizard who gives you several recommendations.  Oh my gawrsh, I didn’t know you could take a boat from the Studios to Epcot!  That sounds like fun!  But I will have to allow at least 37 minutes for that trip so we better leave by 5PM to make sure we are in time for dinner at 6PM.  Thank you Mr Wizard!\n\nThe OLP WDW Transportation Wizard puts the magic of trip planning in your pocket.\n\n\n\nThe OLP TWiz is based on a program written in 1998 using a proprietary technology.  OLP Twiz has been thoroughly tested by thousands of happy users.  You can see the original twiz at ourlaughingplace.com where it is still in use today.  Lucky for you, you can now carry it around on your iPhone or Touch for ready access.\n\nReview from meltdowndisney.com: \nApp alert: The OLP WDW Transportation Wizard for Walt Disney World is the best way you are going to invest 8 quarters. After searching for this functionality in a site, which I really thought I had seen, I noticed this app during a buying binge last week.\nEven from my couch, I could figure out how to get from Pop Century to The (Real Fantasyland of) Grand Floridian for a pedicure, without scuffing my toes. Especially if you have a child who is committed to taking a particular mode of transportation, this app will give you best case scenario guesses on how long it will take get from point a to point b. Wish I’d had it on my last trips, as does the restaurant manager who smiled as I explained that we took a bus, then a boat to the character meal that was about to close, instead of a plain old bus, which according to “Twiz” would have saved us about 25 minutes. Did I mention it was $1.99? Yes, U.S. $1.99, but still. If you are traveling with a small group, one might suffice. If you are traveling with anyone in my family, make sure everyone has one (especially if you plan to split up for a few hours for naps or swimming) so you don’t have to share, or wait at the turnstile for that last little straggler getting off the boat. Saving time is saving Disney Dollars. Invest."

      "label": "•THIS APPLICATION IS FOR DISNEYLAND IN CALIFORNIA. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR DISNEY WORLD IN FLORIDA, CHECK OUT OUR OTHER APPLICATION, HIDDEN MICKEYS: DISNEY WORLD•\n\nThere's an extra special way to enjoy Disneyland and this app is your guide. Hunting for \"Hidden Mickeys\" (images of Mickey Mouse cleverly concealed in DLR's theme parks, restaurants, hotels, and other areas by Disney artists and designers) is fun for all and a bona fide vacation mission for many Disneyland fans. \n\nServing as the OFFICIAL application to Steven Barrett’s bestselling book “Disneyland's Hidden Mickeys – A Field Guide to Disneyland Resort's Best Kept Secrets,” the mouse hunt is taken to a whole new level of interactivity with this application for iPhone and iPod Touch! \n\nUtilizing GPS tracking [iPhone only], your location is scanned and immediately lists the closest Hidden Mickeys to you. If you’re not in the parks, or if you’d rather scroll through the different locations, you are able to browse categorized lists of each Hidden Mickey location. Keep track of which Mickey’s you find with an easy to use built-in scoring system. Keep in mind – this is a scavenger hunt! The score counts if you want it to, so do your best and try to use the least amount of hints as possible. \n\nWhether you’re playing solo or with the whole family, you are able to keep separate user profiles to keep track of everyone’s progress. Spanning both parks and documenting over 480 Hidden Mickeys, this application will add a whole new level of entertainment to your trips to Disneyland! \n\nIn this application you'll discover well over 480 Hidden Mickeys throughout various locations at the Disneyland Resort including: \n• Disneyland Park\n• Disney California Adventure\n• Downtown Disney District\n• Grand Californian Resort and Spa\n• Disneyland Hotel\n• Paradise Pier Hotel\n• And Much More!\n\nPLUS: tips, hints and author Steven Barrett's very own favorite Hidden Mickeys. We've also included the use of Game Center, which allows you gain achievements while playing! We've even hidden a few of these that can only unlock from certain places inside the park - can you get them all?\n\nTrue to their name, Hidden Mickeys are elusive. New ones appear from time to time and some old ones disappear. When that happens — and it will — Steve will let you know on his web site: www.HiddenMickeysGuide.com. Periodically, the application will be updated to reflect these changes, becoming your best source for all things Hidden Mickeys! \n\n“Hidden Mickeys” is based off of the newest and most comprehensive edition of the book. “Disneyland's Hidden Mickeys – A Field Guide to Disneyland Resort's Best Kept Secrets” 5th edition and can be found for sale in stores, or online at Amazon.com."

      "label": "We are happy to offer the 2017 edition of Denver E-70 of the Whizkeys Tollroads as a free update for all our paid users! This version includes all the latest Plate and ExpressToll rate update. Please rate us highly to keep us motivated to keep this app updated and add more features!\n\nWe present the Whizkeys Tollroads edition of Denver's E-470, one of the most expensive tollroads in the US. Did you know that the tolls on E-470 are as high as about 3 miles to a dollar? That translates to about 3 times you pay for gas for the same mileage! No wonder E-470 is known to have only Beemers and Mercedes and Land Rovers driving it - only they can afford this kind of toll!\n\nHere is an app that will help you manage this toll road for the few occasions you have to use it. Find out how much toll you will pay using a simple intuitive interface. Then explore the road and see exactly where all the exits and toll plazas are, so maybe you can plan a route better (remember, you pay big bucks every time you go through a toll plaza!).\n\nKey features: \n1. Complete toll rate information for all plaza combinations for all classes of vehicles, available fully offline \n2. One glance information on distance from every toll and service plaza \n3. Information on amenities available in service plazas \n4. Map showing all plazas, distances and bearings \n5. Tap on your location to get instant feedback on next toll and service plazas \n6. Find out how much you will save by avoiding toll between frequently used plazas \n7. Find out how much you save using Electronic toll (ExpressToll) over License Plate tolling \n8. Full support for iPad/iPod (wifi-only devices may not give you very accurate location) \n9. And more... just explore! \n10. All this for 99c! \n\nKey benefits: \nThis app WILL SAVE YOU MONEY! Remember avoiding a toll road does not always save money because you may spend more on gas. This app will tell you exactly how much you will save by taking into account the extra distance you will travel. You will potentially save many times the price of this app in just one trip!\n\nAnd, if you have a few extra minutes, see how you can avoid E-470 altogether using a single click of a button and explore alternative routes. All the information right in your fingertips, and most of it available without even any Internet connection! \n\nIf we save you on tolls even once, that pays for the app! For under a buck, you cannot go wrong!\n\nPlease send those feedbacks coming, and above all, be safe while driving."

Some common, some not so common. Some we had heard about, but didn’t know where to find, in order to view and photograph them. \n\nWe decided to pull our experience and data together and make discovering them available to everyone.\n\nA great app for photographers trying to capture the beauty of Sedona, and hikers that want to find these amazing and amusing rock formations.\n\nTo those that use our Sedona Hiking App the trail names mentioned in the description and directions will be familiar, but if not, have no fear. The treks to view these formations will not require serious hiking skills, just common sense and proper preparation for the time of year. Most of the View Points we have are easy access and do not require climbing or hard hiking.\n\nIn the App we have marked the actual location of the rock formations themselves and one or more View Points where these amazing rock formations can be seen, photographed and enjoyed. We will tell you what trails take you near the landmarks when it applies and show you an offline map that can give your location on the trail in real-time.\n\nOnce you know where these formations are you’ll begin to see them from all over town.\n\nWe've included these delights:\nCathedral Rock\nBell Rock\nChapel of the Holy Cross\nChimney Rock\nCoffee Pot Rock\nCourthouse Butte\nDevil's Kitchen\nFay Canyon Arch\nGibraltar Rock\nMerry-Go-Round\nThe Rabbit Ears\nSnoopy Rock\nTeacup Rock\nTwo Nuns\nDevil's Bridge\nCapital Butte\nElephant Rock\nMadonna and Child\n\nThe App uses Apple Maps and needs a network connection."

      "label": "This GPS Tour Guide caters to the YOUNG and YOUNG AT HEART who like hiking, swimming in the pools of waterfalls, and ADVENTURE.  Other Hana tour guide apps \"must stops\" are almost all scenic views.  Scenic views are great and we tell you about those too, but we also tell you about hidden waterfalls, swimming holes, waterfalls upstream that you wouldn't know about without the tour.  This audio tour is also for those who like to plan ahead.  This PREMIRE app includes description, multiple pictures, and map for EVERY attraction as well as GPS commentary that plays automatically as you drive for EVERY attraction.  This app is designed to educate and inform you about Maui history and facts and guide you along the Road to Hana.  You can customize your tour and be notified when a stop has your interests.  Works with iPhone, iPad and iPod.  Check out our screen shots and see for yourself.\n\nThe Road to Hana is one of the top rated activities on Maui.  When you purchase this app, for each attraction you will receive-\n\nA personal tour guide telling you about upcoming attractions, hidden falls, unknown hikes, and Maui history and culture\nMultiple pictures of each attraction\nDescription of the stop\nMap showing each stop and where you are in relation to the stop\nThe ability to customize your interests and be notified when you are at a location with your interests\nA rating for each attraction\nAutomatic GPS audio that will begin as you near each location, as well as the ability to start it on their own for those without GPS\nThe ability to replay the audio if you missed something\nThe ability to read along with the audio as it plays\nThe amount of time you can expect to spend at each location\nMile marker of each attraction\nA chime that will go off when you are at one of the attractions so you will never be wondering where the stop is\n\nOne mistake people make as they travel the Road to Hana is to try and read a book telling them about the sights.  Unfortunately, the combination of reading and this winding road makes for a miserable time with carsickness.  When you buy this app, you will be able to sit back and enjoy your travels as you listen to the commentary about the beaches, waterfalls, hikes, history, and interesting facts about Maui.  You also have the option to look ahead and view the pictures and read the descriptions to see which attractions look most interesting to you.  As you begin your tour you will also be given the opportunity to select your interests.  The tour guide will inform you as you reach an attraction with your interests.  \n\nDon’t have GPS?  No worries.  If you are using and iPod or iPad without GPS, you will still be able to enjoy the tour, you will just have to play the information manually as you travel.  Fortunately, each location information page has the mile marker, so you will know when you are getting close to a particular attraction and can play the audio\n\nIt is recommended to bring a phone charger with you.  Though you will not be using cellular service or have data charges, you’re phone will be constantly searching for a GPS signal and thus wear out the battery quickly.  If you don’t have one, try to pick one up at the Walmart or Kmart in Kahului before you leave.  Try to get on the road by 7:00 to avoid the heavy crowds and have the whole day to spend seeing the sights.  Have a fun and safe trip.

All the data used in this app is built into the software, so you can follow the city walks or use the city map without internet access or cellular data plan. No need to pay the costly roaming charges when traveling to foreign cities. The app works with your iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad.\n\nThe powerful navigation assistance includes:\n\n* Walk routes clearly displayed on map.\n* Precise walking directions from one sight to the next.\n* `FindMe` displays your exact location and Auto Tracking displays your movement on the map (this feature is not supported by the iPod Touch and iPad wifi models).\n* Built-in compass to show you the direction.\n* Create your own walks to see the attractions you like.\n* A detailed city map which can be used independently for your other traveling needs.\n\nPlease visit our website at www.GPSmyCity.com to find city walks for over 470 cities worldwide.\n\nNote: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. This app gives you the option to turn off the GPS tracking in the background to prolong the battery life."

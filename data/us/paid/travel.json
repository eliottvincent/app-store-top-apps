      "label": "There are 140+ audio points that play automatically along the scenic drive, featuring the best things to see and do, stories, tips and driving directions.  \n\nProfessional tour guides share advice on how to prioritize your time at recommended “not to be missed” viewpoints, suggested side-trips and places of interest.\n\nTours work offline, using free GPS signal and location services, so no data roaming, network, or wifi is required while touring.\n\nVisit www.gypsyguide.com for route maps, sample audio, tips and advice and what to know before you go.\n\nIt’s Just Like Having a Tour Guide in Your Car™\n\nWHAT TO EXPECT:  \nThe Road to Hana is one of the world’s most scenic drives and a popular sightseeing activity to see Maui’s spectacular waterfalls, black sand beaches, bamboo forests, lava rock formations and amazing ocean views as you wind your way through 620 curves and 59 bridges.\n\nIf you prefer travelling independently, at your own pace, GyPSy Guide provides the best Road to Hana tour experience, along with the freedom to choose what you enjoy; squishing the black sand between your toes at Wai’anapanapa, hiking the Pipiwai Bamboo Trail, or maybe time to enjoy an extra slice of banana bread.\n\nYou can’t help but cheer on the world class windsurfers at Ho’okipa.  And you won’t need to worry about photoshopping the Rainbow Eucalyptus at the Ke’anae Arboretum or the stunning contrast between blue water and black lava rock at Ke’anae Peninsular.\n\nTake a moment to cool off with a quick swim at the pristine Hamoa Beach and see where Haleakala National Park descends from the summit to the sea and the “Seven Sacred Pools” of Oheo at the end of the drive.\n\nWith such a long day of exploring (expect 8-12 hours), it’s important to know the 5 “not to be missed” stops, and the many more suggestions if you have time.  Part of the secret to enjoying the journey is knowing how not to waste your time, and we have tips for that as well.\n\nOn the return drive from Hana, we’ll point out the not to be missed stops again as well as tell you stories about Hawaii’s fascinating history and rich culture.\n\nPlease note Highway #31 ‘backside route’ is not recommended for driving. Rental car insurance void.   Road can be closed for repairs, mudslides and flash floods.\n  \nWHAT YOU’LL SEE:\n\nSome of the highlights along the route include;\n\n•\tHo’okipa Beach Park\n•\tPaia\n•\tKe’anae Peninsular\n•\tWai’anapanapa Park, Black Sand Beach\n•\tHana\n•\tHamoa Beach\n•\tWailua Falls\n•\tTwin Falls\n•\tUpper Waikanai Falls (3 Bears)\n•\tPools of O’heo (Seven Sacred Pools)\n•\tPipiwai Bamboo Trail\n\n**Reservations to visit Wai'anapanapa State Park and black sand beach are now mandatory** \n\n\nBATTERY USAGE:\n++  Continued use of GPS/Location Services in the background increases battery usage.  We strongly recommend taking a cigarette style (DC outlet) car charger.  Avoid using a direct connection to the USB port of a rental vehicle.\n\nIPADS:\n** iPad models must include a GPS chip. Please note that Apple only install these on the iPad Wifi + Cellular models.  Wifi only iPad models have limited location service capabilities and are unable to play commentary automatically.\n\nDOWNLOADING:\nThe apps are larger in size in order to work offline.  You must be on wifi to download as the store may block the download over cellular networks.  \n\nABOUT US:\n\nGyPSy Guide™ produce award winning narrated audio tours along scenic drives and road trips around the world.  \n\nEnjoyed by travelers who prefer to set their own pace and itinerary on vacation, but enjoy a fun, informative and educational guided experience while driving themselves.  \n\nOur goal is to provide a great introduction to the region and inspire you to learn more and return.  \n\nNone of our apps include paid advertising or placements for benefit"

It is the exclusive app for all DoD travelers wanting a quick, easy, reliable, and authorized means to sign up for Space-A at primary departure terminals. \n\nVISITING FAMILY MEMBERS and TDY military & contractors are now using MilSpaceA app as well--there's MUCH MORE here than just space-a signup.\n\nExpanded LOCAL INFO: billeting, car rental, dining, Exchange info, links to air terminals' pages, USOs, & more.\nAIRCRAFT GALLERY: depictions & basic descriptions of DoD pax aircraft\nTRAVEL ADVISORIES - announcements of temporary conditions affecting space-a\nSIGNUP ARCHIVE - stored in-app (as well as in user's own e-mail \"Sent\" items)\nFOREIGN CURRENCY - daily exchange rates for AOIs\nDOCUMENT LIBRARY:  key space-a documents:  policy, guides, handbooks, AMCGrams\nENHANCED ONLINE MAPPING: Your location shown relative to points of interest in the app (requires active geolocation & Internet access). \n\nFirst, browse through \"Airfields of Interest\".  Call ahead to various terminals (call-enabled for iPhone) or visit terminals’ flight schedule pages (if they have them--most don't). Then fill in your details, select departure airfields and destination countries, and send out the signup to register for travel. Some terminals will reply; most will not. Just keep a copy of e-mail(s) as proof of signup.\n\n• Remote space-a signup for multiple airfields. Prepare off- or online--then transmit when you have connectivity.\n• Multi-branch terminal support (Air Force, Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, Guard & Reserve)\n• Complies with Air Mobility Command rules: Signups generated by you, your e-mail as the sender & reply-to address. Copies saved directly in your e-mail Sent items, retrievable anytime.\n• Data privacy: No SSAN required. Exclusive AMC-authorized Pseudo Person ID (PPID) auto-created. (Some Navy locations still insist on SSANs--contact them directly after signup to pass SSAN).  \n• NEW: Now includes optional fields for DoD ID numbers, dates of birth, and passport info.\n• Full control of your data--ability to purge anytime.\n\n***\n\"My mom came to visit me and she used the app, too (...) It's great for anyone visiting [the base].\" - LT\n\"Amazing how easy this app made our trip. This and our books together, because weird or not, I still like the smell of paper\" - JD\n\"Great app. Very easy to use\" - TT\n***\n\nPolicies governing space-a are implemented in DoD Directive 4515.13-R (Air Transportation Eligibility) and AMCI 24-101 Vol 14. Determine your eligibility before registering for travel. CONTACT YOUR LOCAL TERMINAL if you have any questions of eligibility. Refer to http://www.amc.af.mil/amctravel for current official AMC policy. Utilize and support pepperd.com, spacea.net & takeahop.org for unofficial discussions, info, and desktop-based space-a signup.\n\nOnly after mission requirements are met will remaining seats be offered up for space-a. Be prepared for delays or short-notice diversions. Space-A is a privilege, not a right--movement is never guaranteed. UNDERSTAND THE BASICS OF SPACE-A before signing up.\n\nMore about Take-a-Hop--and its MilSpaceA app)\n\nSince inception, Take-a-Hop's platform has generated MILLIONS of space-a signups. Trusted by passengers and passenger service agents (PSAs) alike. Used by tens of thousands of DoD travelers. Solely managed by a USAF veteran who has also traveled military space-a and knows what travelers are up against. MilSpaceA app is not endorsed by the US Federal Government, DoD, or any branch thereof. And still, it's the name recommended by thousands and earning your trust for years.\n\nThanks and Happy Travels!\n\nWEB at www.takeahop.com/app\nLIKE on www.facebook.com/takeahop"

Use the \"Layers\" icon to select which agencies you want displayed to create your own custom map. (Hint, the toggles are color coded to the color each layer is displayed in.)\n\n- Links are provided to each agency's website within the app, so that you can further your research as to what land use rules apply for each public land type - such as permits, fees, activities allowed, and limits of stay.\n\n- Map layers are stored on device - no internet connection required.\n\n- Be sure to turn on the 'Basic' base map to see the US Public Land labels for each land area. This base map layer is also stored entirely on your device, and can be utilized if you do not have an internet connection or would like to conserve bandwidth. \n\n- If you have an internet connection (or have cached them before going out of signal), you can utilize the built in Apple Maps and satellite view maps as the base layer underneath the public land overlays.\n\n- A boondocker's assistant - While US Public Lands is not specifically a camp site locator and does not have a database of specific sites, by turning on the satellite view map, you can better scout out trails, roads and signs of dispersed camping locations within the boundaries of the public land resources. \n\n- Quickly toggle between 'Show' and 'Hide' via the \"Map\" icon to more clearly see satellite images below.\n\n- If you have GPS access on your device, click the 'Locate Me' icon to show your present location - know what type of land you're on right now!\n\n- Built in search tool locates anything on device maps supports (requires internet access) - including cities, states, zip codes, addresses and points of interest. A pin is dropped at the search location.\n\n\nThank you to the Protected Area Database (PAD-US) of the U.S. Geological Survey for providing the public domain raw map data that we’ve been able to utilize to create this interactive overlayable mapping & navigation tool. We will update our maps in the future to stay in sync with improvements to this data set. \n\nPlease note, the USGS PAD-US database contains the “most up-to-date aggregation of Federal lands and waters” available, but this database is still evolving and some locations may not be listed and others may not have precisely accurate boundaries. Resolution across the nation may vary. And always remember - there may be private unmapped inholdings within any public lands - so always pay attention to local signage, indications, and information. \n\nThe US Public Lands app should only be used as an overview, and you should always confirm more precise details by consulting local field offices, administration websites, and other resources. Do not solely rely on this app for determining if you are on public or private land."

What one person describes as working another may describe as broken.\n\nFeatures:\n- Location database is included with the app, so all locations are visible when offline.\n- Filter what type of location to display. List only free dump stations from the filter.\n- Show a route between your location and the selected RV dump station.\n- View the dump stations in list view; easily search the list.\n- Get the local weather for the location.\n- Internet searches and more for each location.\n- Import routes from GPX files.  This makes it much easier to find RV dump stations along a route you've created in another app such as Road Trip Planner.\n- Send a dump station location to our app Road Trip Planner.  This helps in routing your travels (requires separate purchase of the Road Trip Planner app).\n\nWe want to expand our RV dump station database as much as possible, so we have made it easy for you to easily submit a new RV dump station - simply tap the + button below the map.  To correct or update dump station information, tap “Location Comment” in the detail view. We will be updating the database often.\n\nDue to the nature of dump stations constantly changing their status it's recommended you contact the dump station prior to using it to verify its existence."

No Login. \n\nNow in their 11th year as a mobile app, and their 13th online, the Wise Pilgrim Guides are the go-to source of up-to-date information on the Camino de Santiago.\n\nThe app is updated regularly with new content and new features and offers you the ability to leave tips for pilgrims following behind you.\n\nThis guide covers the Camino Francés, the most popular route across Spain. It has been redesigned and now works almost exclusively offline (to share your comments with others will require a data connection).  As more an more albergues share their WiFi this becomes less of an issue, and the guide will tell you which ones offer WiFi.\n\nAccommodation Directory:  \nA full directory of Albergues, camping, hotels, pensions, paradors, and cases rurales.  Over 900 in total, with special attention to those that can be booked online.\n\nStageless Guide:\nNo more \"stage anxiety\" or guide created bottlenecks.\n\nMaps:  \nOffline and online versions of a beautiful topographical may will give you a good view of the terrain ahead.\n\nPhotos: \nPhotos of albergues, monuments and other points of interest along the way.  Currently 900+ images and growing.\n\nScrollable Elevation Map:  \nThis one is hard to show with just a screenshot, but the elevation that appears at the top of every city page scrolls East to West.  One complete elevation, from St. Jean Pied de Port to Santiago, uninterrupted by page folds.\n\nComments:  \nAlbergue closed early for the season?  Have a restaurant that you want to share, or perhaps one to warn others about?  Every location in the app gives you the opportunity to leave a comment and to read the comments left by others. No registration necessary.\n\n¡Buen Camino and thank you for your support!"

You get some rest, maybe shop a bit and move on early in the morning.\n\nHow will this app help you? RVer or not, this app shows all Walmart locations in US and Canada. Use it to find shopping now and for RVing later.\n\nWant to know where every Walmart is located and which ones have been reported to allow and don't allow overnight parking?\n\nFilter map to see if has fuel, pharmacy, garden center, a restaurant and much more.\n\nThis app plots every Walmart store in the USA and Canada on the map view. It uses location services to find your location and as you move.\n\nLocal influence and RVer abuse have meant that about 1/4 of stores no longer allow overnights, so you might want ask a manager ahead of time. Please submit your reports to us so we can keep this app accurate. I get numerous reports about stores every single day. It’s always changing...\n\nWhat's in it: Walmart's of all kinds. Can you park there or have others been denied or even towed? Tips are provided from other RVers as to where to park in the lot. \n\nIt integrates nicely with maps to display up to 150 points of interest on a map.\n\nDon’t take even one more trip without Walmart Overnight Parking. It can always change by the time you get there but at least you can be aware of what others have experienced lately.\n\nAllstays LLC, the provider of this App is not affiliated with, sponsored by or in any way related to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.

IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR DISNEYLAND IN CALIFORNIA, CHECK OUT OUR OTHER APP \"HIDDEN MICKEYS: DISNEYLAND\"•\n\nThere's an extra special way to enjoy Walt Disney World and this app is your guide. Hunting for \"Hidden Mickeys\" (images of Mickey Mouse cleverly concealed in WDW's theme parks, restaurants, hotels, and other areas by Disney artists and designers) is fun for all and a bona fide vacation mission for many Disney World fans.\n\nServing as the OFFICIAL application to Steven Barrett’s bestselling book “Hidden Mickeys – A Field Guide to Walt Disney World's Best Kept Secrets,” the mouse hunt is taken to a whole new level of interactivity with this application for iPhone and iPod Touch! \n\nUtilizing GPS tracking [iPhone only], your location is scanned and immediately lists the closest Hidden Mickeys to you. If you’re not in the parks, or if you’d rather scroll through the different locations, you are able to browse categorized lists of each Hidden Mickey location. Keep track of which Mickey’s you find with an easy to use built-in scoring system. Keep in mind – this is a scavenger hunt! The score counts if you want it to, so do your best and try to use the least amount of hints as possible.\n\nWhether you’re playing solo or with the whole family, you are able to keep separate user profiles to keep track of everyone’s progress. Spanning all four parks and documenting over 1200 Hidden Mickeys, this application will add a whole new level of entertainment to your trips to Disney World!\n\nIn this application you'll discover well over 1200 Hidden Mickeys throughout various locations at the Walt Disney World Resort including:\n• Magic Kingdom Park \n• Epcot\n• Disney's Hollywood Studios\n• Disney’s Animal Kingdom\n• Blizzard Beach & Typhoon Lagoon Water Parks\n• Disney Springs\n• EPSN Wide World of Sports\n• Miniature Golf Courses\n• Over 20 DIFFERENT Disney Hotels\n\nPLUS: tips, hints and author Steven Barrett's very own favorite Hidden Mickeys. We've also included the use of Game Center, which allows you gain achievements while playing! We've even hidden a few of these that can only unlock from certain places inside the park - can you get them all?\n\nTrue to their name, Hidden Mickeys are elusive. New ones appear from time to time and some old ones disappear. When that happens — and it will — Steve will let you know on his web site: www.HiddenMickeysGuide.com. Periodically, the application will be updated to reflect these changes, becoming your best source for all things Hidden Mickeys!\n\n“Hidden Mickeys” is based off of the newest and most comprehensive edition of the book. “Hidden Mickeys – A Field Guide to Walt Disney World's Best Kept Secrets” 8th edition can be found for sale throughout Disney World, in stores, or online at Amazon.com."

If more than 80 stations are in the area being viewed, a random assortment of 80 stations will be displayed.\n\nThere is no \"phoning home\" with data, personal or not.  If a data connection is available, the FCC servers will be asked for contour plot data when a tower is selected. This will show up as a blue overlay showing the calculated area over which the signal will drop off by at most 35 dBu. Basically, this is the area where an antenna not too near the ground has a chance to receive the signal; your luck will vary. Once downloaded, the data is stored for the next time you select the tower.\n\nErrors and omissions are to be expected especially for stations with low power licenses. Please e-mail the support address if you find a glaring omission or error; I'll need a call sign and a TV network."

No hidden costs.\nNow in their 11th year as a mobile app, and their 13th online, the Wise Pilgrim Guides are the go-to source of up-to-date information on the Camino de Santiago.\n\nThe app is updated regularly with new content and new features and offers you the ability to leave tips for pilgrims following behind you.\n\nThis guide covers the Camino Primitivo, the original route across northern Spain. It has been redesigned and now works almost exclusively offline (to share your comments with others will require a data connection).  As more an more albergues share their WiFi this becomes less of an issue, and the guide will tell you which ones offer WiFi.\n\nAccommodation Directory:  \nA full directory of Albergues, camping, hotels, pensions, paradors, and cases rurales; with special attention to those that can be booked online.\n\nStageless Guide:\nNo more \"stage anxiety\" or guide created bottlenecks.\n\nMaps:  \nOffline and online versions of a beautiful topographical may will give you a good view of the terrain ahead.\n\nPhotos: \nPhotos of albergues, monuments and other points of interest along the way.  Currently 900+ images and growing.\n\nScrollable Elevation Map:  \nThis one is hard to show with just a screenshot, but the elevation that appears at the top of every city page scrolls East to West.  One complete elevation, from St. Jean Pied de Port to Santiago, uninterrupted by page folds.\n\nComments:  \nAlbergue closed early for the season?  Have a restaurant that you want to share, or perhaps one to warn others about?  Every location in the app gives you the opportunity to leave a comment and to read the comments left by others. No registration necessary.\n\n¡Buen Camino and thank you for your support!"

Ideal for almost anything that requires measuring outdoor distance traveled such as walking, running, driving, boating, or hiking.  Note that GPS does not work well under a roof.  For best results, use outdoors.\n\nBenefits of the paid version:\n- Landscape and splitscreen support.\n- Ability to have multiple trips.  Each trip can be stopped and started independently.\n- Receive notifications while the application is closed at distance intervals of your choosing.\n- Custom units readout.  For example, you want to know how many calories you have burned.  You can customize this to include anything that has a linear relationship with distance traveled.  This can be different for each trip.\n- No advertisements.\n- Export trips via email and optionally restore later.\n\nDisplays:\n- Distance\n- Time elapsed\n- Speed (average or current)\n- Displacement (straight line distance from your starting point) This can be hidden.\n\nDistance units include:\n- Kilometers\n- Miles\n- Nautical miles\n- Meters\n- Feet\n\nSpeed units include:\n- Kilometers per hour\n- Miles per hour\n- Nautical miles per hour\n- Meters per second\n- Feet per second\n\nOther features:\n- Large font adjustable display.\n- Accurate to within 1 percent when compared to most car odometers under normal driving conditions.\n- Includes a lock to help prevent accidental reset of your trip. After unlocked, it locks back in a few seconds, or you can lock it yourself.\n- Approximates distance traveled in some GPS dead spots such as driving through a tunnel by adding the as-a-bird flies distance to your trip.\n\nPlease also note:\n- GPS Odometer does run in the background if you leave it running.  Be sure to pause the trip when you are finished or battery life will be negatively affected.  The timer stops when the trip is paused.\n- To change the display, tap the unlock button and notice the three green boxes that temporarily appear. Each button adjusts a different part of the display.\n- You can change the language to English in the application settings.\n\nPlease visit the web page for more details."

All the hidden details will be displayed in an easy-to-read format.  Boarding Pass Scanner interprets the data so you can quickly see what's there.

Scan the boarding pass and email it to colleagues, family, or friends so they have your updated flight information.\n\nNote that although most airlines follow the barcoded boarding pass standard (we have successfully tested dozens of airlines, around the world), some airlines don't exactly follow the standard.  As we identify them them, we continue update the app to support them.  If you find a Boarding pass that doesn't properly decode, contact our support with a clear photo of your boarding pass, and we will add support for that airline.\n\n-- Please note that this app does not change a paper boarding pass to a mobile boarding pass.  Not all airlines support mobile boarding passes at all stations; please refer to your airline for more information on obtaining mobile boarding passes.

      "label": "•THIS APPLICATION IS FOR DISNEYLAND IN CALIFORNIA. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR DISNEY WORLD IN FLORIDA, CHECK OUT OUR OTHER APPLICATION, HIDDEN MICKEYS: DISNEY WORLD•\n\nThere's an extra special way to enjoy Disneyland and this app is your guide. Hunting for \"Hidden Mickeys\" (images of Mickey Mouse cleverly concealed in DLR's theme parks, restaurants, hotels, and other areas by Disney artists and designers) is fun for all and a bona fide vacation mission for many Disneyland fans. \n\nServing as the OFFICIAL application to Steven Barrett’s bestselling book “Disneyland's Hidden Mickeys – A Field Guide to Disneyland Resort's Best Kept Secrets,” the mouse hunt is taken to a whole new level of interactivity with this application for iPhone and iPod Touch! \n\nUtilizing GPS tracking [iPhone only], your location is scanned and immediately lists the closest Hidden Mickeys to you. If you’re not in the parks, or if you’d rather scroll through the different locations, you are able to browse categorized lists of each Hidden Mickey location. Keep track of which Mickey’s you find with an easy to use built-in scoring system. Keep in mind – this is a scavenger hunt! The score counts if you want it to, so do your best and try to use the least amount of hints as possible. \n\nWhether you’re playing solo or with the whole family, you are able to keep separate user profiles to keep track of everyone’s progress. Spanning both parks and documenting over 480 Hidden Mickeys, this application will add a whole new level of entertainment to your trips to Disneyland! \n\nIn this application you'll discover well over 480 Hidden Mickeys throughout various locations at the Disneyland Resort including: \n• Disneyland Park\n• Disney California Adventure\n• Downtown Disney District\n• Grand Californian Resort and Spa\n• Disneyland Hotel\n• Paradise Pier Hotel\n• And Much More!\n\nPLUS: tips, hints and author Steven Barrett's very own favorite Hidden Mickeys. We've also included the use of Game Center, which allows you gain achievements while playing! We've even hidden a few of these that can only unlock from certain places inside the park - can you get them all?\n\nTrue to their name, Hidden Mickeys are elusive. New ones appear from time to time and some old ones disappear. When that happens — and it will — Steve will let you know on his web site: www.HiddenMickeysGuide.com. Periodically, the application will be updated to reflect these changes, becoming your best source for all things Hidden Mickeys! \n\n“Hidden Mickeys” is based off of the newest and most comprehensive edition of the book. “Disneyland's Hidden Mickeys – A Field Guide to Disneyland Resort's Best Kept Secrets” 5th edition and can be found for sale in stores, or online at Amazon.com."

In cities like New York where you have to swipe your transit card to unlock the turnstile, forgetting your balance and being greeted by an \"insufficient funds\" message can be annoying, and delay your journey.\n\nMetroBuddy lets you enter your current MetroCard balance, and update it each time you swipe. Never lose time at the MetroCard reader again, your balance will always be available on your phone! The app also calculates how many rides you have left, based on your fare. Use the History tab to review the changes you made to your balance.\n\nMetroBuddy also provides Siri shortcuts to record a swipe and check your balance. This enables you to build powerful automation for your commute, such as recording a swipe, starting your favorite playlist, and checking the next train departure.\n\nIf you are using iOS 14 or later, you can add a widget to your home screen or your widget center to view your balance even faster.\n\nWe are proud to be working on making MetroBuddy as inclusive as possible. You can change your fare if you have a more affordable one. The app is also fully compatible with iOS assistive technologies such as VoiceOver, Dynamic Type, and VoiceControl. Turnstiles are not fully accessible, but MetroBuddy is.\n\nDo not hesitate to reach out with feedback and/or questions by e-mail at hi@alexisonline.dev.\n\nPlease note that MetroBuddy is a hobby app and is not affiliated with New York's MTA in any way."

Anyone can retrieve that information. This app presents it in a much more readable fashion than is available from the CHP.\n\nMajor Features:\n• View the incidents on a map\n• Glossary, so you can decipher what the CHP shorthand actually means.\n• A \"Mark\" button that lets you mark the locations of incidents and traffic hazards so you can more easily report them to the authorities later.\n\nFOR CALIFORNIA ONLY."

All updates are free.\n\nNow in their 11th year as a mobile app, and their 13th online, the Wise Pilgrim Guides are the go-to source of up-to-date information on the Camino de Santiago.\n\nThe app is updated regularly with new content and new features and offers you the ability to leave tips for pilgrims following behind you.\n\nThis guide covers the Camino Portugués and its three most common variations; the Central Route, the Coastal Route, and the Variante Espiritual. It has been redesigned and now works almost exclusively offline (to share your comments with others will require a data connection).  As more an more albergues share their WiFi this becomes less of an issue, and the guide will tell you which ones offer WiFi.\n\nAccommodation Directory:  \nA full directory of Albergues, camping, hotels, pensions, paradors, and cases rurales.  Over 400 in total, with special attention to those that can be booked online.\n\nStageless Guide:\nNo more \"stage anxiety\" or guide created bottlenecks.\n\nMaps:  \nOffline and online versions of a beautiful topographical may will give you a good view of the terrain ahead.\n\nPhotos: \nPhotos of albergues, monuments and other points of interest along the way.  Currently 400+ images and growing.\n\nScrollable Elevation Map:  \nThis one is hard to show with just a screenshot, but the elevation that appears at the top of every city page scrolls East to West.  One complete elevation, from St. Jean Pied de Port to Santiago, uninterrupted by page folds.\n\nComments:  \nAlbergue closed early for the season?  Have a restaurant that you want to share, or perhaps one to warn others about?  Every location in the app gives you the opportunity to leave a comment and to read the comments left by others. No registration necessary.\n\n¡Buen Camino and thank you for your support!"

No hidden costs.\n\nNow in their 11th year as a mobile app, and their 13th online, the Wise Pilgrim Guides are the go-to source of up-to-date information on the Camino de Santiago.\n\nThe app is updated regularly with new content and new features and offers you the ability to leave tips for pilgrims following behind you.\n\nThis guide covers the Camino del Norte from Irún to Santiago de Compostela and includes all of the alternate routes along the way. It has been redesigned and now works almost exclusively offline (to share your comments with others will require a data connection).  As more an more albergues share their WiFi this becomes less of an issue, and the guide will tell you which ones offer WiFi.\n\nAccommodation Directory:  \nA full directory of Albergues, camping, hotels, pensions, paradors, and cases rurales.  Over 500 in total, with special attention to those that can be booked online.\n\nStageless Guide:\nNo more \"stage anxiety\" or guide created bottlenecks.\n\nMaps:  \nOffline and online versions of a beautiful topographical may will give you a good view of the terrain ahead.\n\nPhotos: \nPhotos of albergues, monuments and other points of interest along the way.  Currently 400+ images and growing.\n\nScrollable Elevation Map:  \nThis one is hard to show with just a screenshot, but the elevation that appears at the top of every city page scrolls East to West.  One complete elevation, from Irún to Santiago, uninterrupted by page folds.\n\nComments:  \nAlbergue closed early for the season?  Have a restaurant that you want to share, or perhaps one to warn others about?  Every location in the app gives you the opportunity to leave a comment and to read the comments left by others. No registration necessary.\n\n¡Buen Camino and thank you for your support!"

Those passwords are then sent to foXnoMad for verification and approval before they are added to the map.\n\n*In ‘List View’ you can update passwords for airports already added (when you’ve noticed some changes). As you travel you can also rate the wireless hotspot information to let us know if the details worked for you or not. Based on traveler feedback, the connection information is updated, verified, or removed.\n\n*WiFox icons indicate how fresh, reliable, and highly rated a given airport wireless network’s information is.\n\n*WiFox is updated continuously with information travelers, pilots, and other users send through the WiFox app, foXnoMad website, and foXnoMad Facebook and Twitter accounts. WiFox currently has wireless Internet information for over 700 airports around the world.\n\n*The map is updated automatically upon opening the app (when you have Internet access) or by clicking the ‘Update’ button on the map or refresh icon on the List View.\n\n*WiFox also protects users on free (open) wifi networks by telling you the proper network name, so you don't unintentionally connect to a rogue or malicious access point.\n\nWiFox Premium subscriptions unlock the following features:\n\n* Automatic notifications of the highest rated password, with network connection information, as soon as you land. WiFox Premium detects the airport you're at and displays the most relevant wifi network name and password so you can get online as soon as you step off the plane.\n\n* View password ratings to see which passwords work best throughout an airport so you can connect to the strongest and most reliable connection.\n\n* Be able to add your own password ratings within WiFox. Premium user priority ratings ensure the best wifi passwords are always displayed.\n\nAfter a 30-day free trial period a $24.99/year purchase will be applied to your iTunes account following confirmation of a Premium upgrade.

Street View coverage is displayed in blue.\n\n\nEASY TO USE\nWalking through panoramas has never been easier using the interactive, expandable mini map that also displays your viewing angle and field of view. Virtually traveling abroad is even more immersive and fun with Live Panorama mode: Turn around in the panorama simply by rotating the device.\n\n\nAPPLE WATCH APP\nStreets is the only app capable of displaying 360° Street View panoramas on the Apple Watch.

Troubled spirits, ruthless pirates, and tortured slaves are all eternally trapped in these walls. \n\nJoin me on a narrated walking tour of the French Quarter's most haunted sites. The tour includes 18 sites and is about 2.5 miles long. \n\nAll Two Buck Tours include maps with GPS, directions, photos, text, and are narrated in English. Too spooked? Rain? Take a break and resume later. It's like having your own personal guide, at a fraction of the price. No schedules, no crowds, no worries."

      "label": "There are 140+ audio points that play automatically along the scenic drive, featuring the best things to see and do, stories, tips and driving directions.  \n\nProfessional tour guides share advice on how to prioritize your time at recommended “not to be missed” viewpoints, suggested side-trips and places of interest.\n\nTours work offline, using free GPS signal and location services, so no data roaming, network, or wifi is required while touring.\n\nVisit www.gypsyguide.com for route maps, sample audio, tips and advice and what to know before you go.\n\nIt’s Just Like Having a Tour Guide in Your Car™\n\nWHAT TO EXPECT:  \nThe Road to Hana is one of the world’s most scenic drives and a popular sightseeing activity to see Maui’s spectacular waterfalls, black sand beaches, bamboo forests, lava rock formations and amazing ocean views as you wind your way through 620 curves and 59 bridges.\n\nIf you prefer travelling independently, at your own pace, GyPSy Guide provides the best Road to Hana tour experience, along with the freedom to choose what you enjoy; squishing the black sand between your toes at Wai’anapanapa, hiking the Pipiwai Bamboo Trail, or maybe time to enjoy an extra slice of banana bread.\n\nYou can’t help but cheer on the world class windsurfers at Ho’okipa.  And you won’t need to worry about photoshopping the Rainbow Eucalyptus at the Ke’anae Arboretum or the stunning contrast between blue water and black lava rock at Ke’anae Peninsular.\n\nTake a moment to cool off with a quick swim at the pristine Hamoa Beach and see where Haleakala National Park descends from the summit to the sea and the “Seven Sacred Pools” of Oheo at the end of the drive.\n\nWith such a long day of exploring (expect 8-12 hours), it’s important to know the 5 “not to be missed” stops, and the many more suggestions if you have time.  Part of the secret to enjoying the journey is knowing how not to waste your time, and we have tips for that as well.\n\nOn the return drive from Hana, we’ll point out the not to be missed stops again as well as tell you stories about Hawaii’s fascinating history and rich culture.\n\nPlease note Highway #31 ‘backside route’ is not recommended for driving. Rental car insurance void.   Road can be closed for repairs, mudslides and flash floods.\n  \nWHAT YOU’LL SEE:\n\nSome of the highlights along the route include;\n\n•\tHo’okipa Beach Park\n•\tPaia\n•\tKe’anae Peninsular\n•\tWai’anapanapa Park, Black Sand Beach\n•\tHana\n•\tHamoa Beach\n•\tWailua Falls\n•\tTwin Falls\n•\tUpper Waikanai Falls (3 Bears)\n•\tPools of O’heo (Seven Sacred Pools)\n•\tPipiwai Bamboo Trail\n\n**Reservations to visit Wai'anapanapa State Park and black sand beach are now mandatory** \n\n\nBATTERY USAGE:\n++  Continued use of GPS/Location Services in the background increases battery usage.  We strongly recommend taking a cigarette style (DC outlet) car charger.  Avoid using a direct connection to the USB port of a rental vehicle.\n\nIPADS:\n** iPad models must include a GPS chip. Please note that Apple only install these on the iPad Wifi + Cellular models.  Wifi only iPad models have limited location service capabilities and are unable to play commentary automatically.\n\nDOWNLOADING:\nThe apps are larger in size in order to work offline.  You must be on wifi to download as the store may block the download over cellular networks.  \n\nABOUT US:\n\nGyPSy Guide™ produce award winning narrated audio tours along scenic drives and road trips around the world.  \n\nEnjoyed by travelers who prefer to set their own pace and itinerary on vacation, but enjoy a fun, informative and educational guided experience while driving themselves.  \n\nOur goal is to provide a great introduction to the region and inspire you to learn more and return.  \n\nNone of our apps include paid advertising or placements for benefit"

Use the \"Layers\" icon to select which agencies you want displayed to create your own custom map. (Hint, the toggles are color coded to the color each layer is displayed in.)\n\n- Links are provided to each agency's website within the app, so that you can further your research as to what land use rules apply for each public land type - such as permits, fees, activities allowed, and limits of stay.\n\n- Map layers are stored on device - no internet connection required.\n\n- Be sure to turn on the 'Basic' base map to see the US Public Land labels for each land area. This base map layer is also stored entirely on your device, and can be utilized if you do not have an internet connection or would like to conserve bandwidth. \n\n- If you have an internet connection (or have cached them before going out of signal), you can utilize the built in Apple Maps and satellite view maps as the base layer underneath the public land overlays.\n\n- A boondocker's assistant - While US Public Lands is not specifically a camp site locator and does not have a database of specific sites, by turning on the satellite view map, you can better scout out trails, roads and signs of dispersed camping locations within the boundaries of the public land resources. \n\n- Quickly toggle between 'Show' and 'Hide' via the \"Map\" icon to more clearly see satellite images below.\n\n- If you have GPS access on your device, click the 'Locate Me' icon to show your present location - know what type of land you're on right now!\n\n- Built in search tool locates anything on device maps supports (requires internet access) - including cities, states, zip codes, addresses and points of interest.

We will update our maps in the future to stay in sync with improvements to this data set. \n\nPlease note, the USGS PAD-US database contains the “most up-to-date aggregation of Federal lands and waters” available, but this database is still evolving and some locations may not be listed and others may not have precisely accurate boundaries. Resolution across the nation may vary. And always remember - there may be private unmapped inholdings within any public lands - so always pay attention to local signage, indications, and information. \n\nThe US Public Lands app should only be used as an overview, and you should always confirm more precise details by consulting local field offices, administration websites, and other resources. Do not solely rely on this app for determining if you are on public or private land."

Get Airborne.\n\nOr access LOCAL INFO--before you depart, just after arrival--anytime. \n\nMilSpaceA app allows authorized U.S. government users to register for Department of Defense (DoD) military space-available travel. It is the exclusive app for all DoD travelers wanting a quick, easy, reliable, and authorized means to sign up for Space-A at primary departure terminals. \n\nVISITING FAMILY MEMBERS and TDY military & contractors are now using MilSpaceA app as well--there's MUCH MORE here than just space-a signup.\n\nExpanded LOCAL INFO: billeting, car rental, dining, Exchange info, links to air terminals' pages, USOs, & more.\nAIRCRAFT GALLERY: depictions & basic descriptions of DoD pax aircraft\nTRAVEL ADVISORIES - announcements of temporary conditions affecting space-a\nSIGNUP ARCHIVE - stored in-app (as well as in user's own e-mail \"Sent\" items)\nFOREIGN CURRENCY - daily exchange rates for AOIs\nDOCUMENT LIBRARY:  key space-a documents:  policy, guides, handbooks, AMCGrams\nENHANCED ONLINE MAPPING: Your location shown relative to points of interest in the app (requires active geolocation & Internet access). \n\nFirst, browse through \"Airfields of Interest\".  Call ahead to various terminals (call-enabled for iPhone) or visit terminals’ flight schedule pages (if they have them--most don't). Then fill in your details, select departure airfields and destination countries, and send out the signup to register for travel. Some terminals will reply; most will not. Just keep a copy of e-mail(s) as proof of signup.\n\n• Remote space-a signup for multiple airfields. Prepare off- or online--then transmit when you have connectivity.\n• Multi-branch terminal support (Air Force, Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, Guard & Reserve)\n• Complies with Air Mobility Command rules: Signups generated by you, your e-mail as the sender & reply-to address. Copies saved directly in your e-mail Sent items, retrievable anytime.\n• Data privacy: No SSAN required. Exclusive AMC-authorized Pseudo Person ID (PPID) auto-created. (Some Navy locations still insist on SSANs--contact them directly after signup to pass SSAN).  \n• NEW: Now includes optional fields for DoD ID numbers, dates of birth, and passport info.\n• Full control of your data--ability to purge anytime.\n\n***\n\"My mom came to visit me and she used the app, too (...) It's great for anyone visiting [the base].\" - LT\n\"Amazing how easy this app made our trip. This and our books together, because weird or not, I still like the smell of paper\" - JD\n\"Great app. Very easy to use\" - TT\n***\n\nPolicies governing space-a are implemented in DoD Directive 4515.13-R (Air Transportation Eligibility) and AMCI 24-101 Vol 14. Determine your eligibility before registering for travel. CONTACT YOUR LOCAL TERMINAL if you have any questions of eligibility. Refer to http://www.amc.af.mil/amctravel for current official AMC policy. Utilize and support pepperd.com, spacea.net & takeahop.org for unofficial discussions, info, and desktop-based space-a signup.\n\nOnly after mission requirements are met will remaining seats be offered up for space-a. Be prepared for delays or short-notice diversions. Space-A is a privilege, not a right--movement is never guaranteed. UNDERSTAND THE BASICS OF SPACE-A before signing up.\n\nMore about Take-a-Hop--and its MilSpaceA app)\n\nSince inception, Take-a-Hop's platform has generated MILLIONS of space-a signups. Trusted by passengers and passenger service agents (PSAs) alike. Used by tens of thousands of DoD travelers. Solely managed by a USAF veteran who has also traveled military space-a and knows what travelers are up against. MilSpaceA app is not endorsed by the US Federal Government, DoD, or any branch thereof. And still, it's the name recommended by thousands and earning your trust for years.\n\nThanks and Happy Travels!\n\nWEB at www.takeahop.com/app\nLIKE on www.facebook.com/takeahop"

This helps in routing your travels (requires separate purchase of the Road Trip Planner app).\n\nWe want to expand our RV dump station database as much as possible, so we have made it easy for you to easily submit a new RV dump station - simply tap the + button below the map.  To correct or update dump station information, tap “Location Comment” in the detail view.

Use it to find shopping now and for RVing later.\n\nWant to know where every Walmart is located and which ones have been reported to allow and don't allow overnight parking?\n\nFilter map to see if has fuel, pharmacy, garden center, a restaurant and much more.\n\nThis app plots every Walmart store in the USA and Canada on the map view. It uses location services to find your location and as you move.\n\nLocal influence and RVer abuse have meant that about 1/4 of stores no longer allow overnights, so you might want ask a manager ahead of time. Please submit your reports to us so we can keep this app accurate. I get numerous reports about stores every single day. It’s always changing...\n\nWhat's in it: Walmart's of all kinds. Can you park there or have others been denied or even towed? Tips are provided from other RVers as to where to park in the lot. \n\nIt integrates nicely with maps to display up to 150 points of interest on a map.\n\nDon’t take even one more trip without Walmart Overnight Parking. It can always change by the time you get there but at least you can be aware of what others have experienced lately.\n\nAllstays LLC, the provider of this App is not affiliated with, sponsored by or in any way related to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.

The database includes over 2000 stations and over 1000 repeaters. My users include avid RVers who roam from region to region and need to locate available TV networks, and homeowners setting up a new antenna system. \n\nApple Watch (Series 5) users can make use of their compass with the optional in-app purchase of an embedded watch app. \n \nThere is an alternate compass tab which shows the direction of stations within a 45 mile radius—given enough screen space—just look over your phone to see which way to point your antenna.\n\nPinch to zoom into your locality, or hit the circular location button to concentrate on local stations. If more than 80 stations are in the area being viewed, a random assortment of 80 stations will be displayed.\n\nThere is no \"phoning home\" with data, personal or not.  If a data connection is available, the FCC servers will be asked for contour plot data when a tower is selected. This will show up as a blue overlay showing the calculated area over which the signal will drop off by at most 35 dBu. Basically, this is the area where an antenna not too near the ground has a chance to receive the signal; your luck will vary. Once downloaded, the data is stored for the next time you select the tower.\n\nErrors and omissions are to be expected especially for stations with low power licenses. Please e-mail the support address if you find a glaring omission or error; I'll need a call sign and a TV network."

      "label": "Where's the closest RV Dump station at a campground, a rest area, a truck stop, a water treatment plant?\n\nRV Dumps knows these things. And you can easily know too. This same data is part of the \"Camp and RV\" app which has a dump station filter in it.\n\nRV Dumps checks your location and displays up to 150 points on a map view. You can filter by type to see only what you want to see on the map and zoom out. You can also use the offline manual lookup to find locations by type, state and city...even when you have no phone service!\n\nRV Dumps takes the database from the top ranked camping app called Camp & RV and filters all points that have a dump station as an amenity (not \"hookups\" which are at a site. Many parks no longer have stand alone stations.) Maybe you need one and a night stop or you are just passing on through. From Rest Areas to truck stops to private campgrounds (either stay the night or call to see if you can pay a separate fee). From State Parks to even some National Park and Forest campgrounds that have one.\n\nDump stations are being paved over left and right these days. We removed several each day that are found to be closed. Please send in reports and adds. I have hundreds more dump locations that I don't have GPS points for so they can't be placed in the mobile app yet. I keep working on those.\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Search for specific locations around you on a map.\n- One-touch calling for places that have a phone number listed. Good idea to call and ask about the fees as Flying J now charges for it.\n- One-touch turn-by-turn directions for all POIs.\n- Works when iPhone has no phone service.\n- Supports a manual lookup mode where users can look up parks and truck stops that have RV dumps.\n\nUpdates make major changes that early app reviews won't reflect. We added thousands of places like waste water treatment plants, dealerships, gas stations, public places, storage places and stores."

      "label": "The wildly popular TWiz App just got a whole lot better with the release of GPS TWiz.  Now you can navigate the Disney transportation system at Walt Disney World using a familiar and intuitive map-based GPS interface.  You can view your location, use pinch/zoom gestures to zoom in and out, and select beginning and ending locations for your trip from the map in addition to the list.\n\nAre you boggled by maps and prefer to just search for words?  On the super duper GPS TWiz, you can search for locations using a convenient search bar.  For example, type \"bo\" to find the Boardwalk Inn -  it's just that easy.  Or you can tap the \"Near\" button to pick a location that is close to your current location.\n\nGPS Twiz puts the fun in functionality! Simply pick a starting location (where you are) and then pick the place you want to get to. Mr. Wizard will promptly make fun suggestions about how to get there using Transportation. Mr. Wizard also estimates how long it will take to get there. By tapping on the route, you get lots of helpful tips about the transportation system and you can share your experience of times and tips with other users.\n\nYou can also choose the driving or walking icon and Mr. Wizard (with the help of Google Maps) will map your route for you and give you an estimate of the time to walk or drive that route.\n\nImagine you are on your first trip to the Grand Floridian. You arrive at your hotel, unpack your bags and call your friends who happen to be staying at the Boardwalk Inn. You decide you want to meet for dinner at the Flying Fish café… but you don’t have a car, and you have no idea how to get to the Boardwalk from the Grand Floridian. You whip out your iPhone and the GPS Transportation Wizard comes to your rescue; promptly suggesting several routes involving boats, buses, or monorails. He even tells you how long it’s likely to take so you won’t be late for dinner. Thank you Mr Wizard!\n\nOr, perhaps you are a veteran of Disneyworld and love planning daily itineraries. You plan your trip, making a careful schedule of where to eat and which parks to go to when. You decide that a fun day at the Hollywood Studios would really be nicely topped off by dinner at Chefs de France. But how long is it going to take to get there, and what is the funnest possible route (this is a vacation after all!)? You pop out your iPhone and fire up the OLP WDW Transportation Wizard who gives you several recommendations. Oh my gawrsh, I didn’t know you could take a boat from the Studios to Epcot! That sounds like fun! But I will have to allow at least 37 minutes for that trip so we better leave by 5PM to make sure we are in time for dinner at 6PM. Thank you Mr Wizard!\n\nNow you can share your favorite routes with a friend, and you can influence Mr. Wizard's magic by voting thumbs up or thumbs down on the routes he suggests.  You can send in helpful tips about routes that Mr. Wizard can share with the community of TWiz users.  \n\nThe GPS Transportation Wizard puts even more pixie dust magic of trip planning in your pocket.\n\nThe GPS TWiz is based on a program written in 1998 using a proprietary technology. Twiz has been thoroughly tested by thousands of happy users."

      "label": "Love exploring Joshua Tree but hate that you can't get a cell signal in the park, making it nearly impossible to find the best sights? Well, today's your lucky day!\n\nIntroducing our new offline Joshua Tree National Park (and surrounding areas) photo guide. Now you can get all the great photos, content, and exact locations that you already love in Fotospot, but with one big difference - offline maps! When you have a working WiFi connection, simply download our offline guide to your device and, like magic, the app will now work when you don't have an internet connection. You'll be able to check in, save attractions for later, add new photos, and - best of all - find the exact locations of all the coolest Joshua Tree spots including Heart Rock, Lost Horse Mine, Barker Dam, and Skull Rock - all without having a working cell signal!\n\nPlease note, some of these attractions can be found in our flagship app, Fotospot, but with two huge differences:\n\n1. Exclusive Content \nSome of the coolest (and hardest to find) attractions can only be found here like the Iron Door Cave, Penguin Rock, Eagle Cliff Boulder House, Samuelson Rocks, the Freak Brothers, and Garrett's Arch (the largest arch in the park!), plus a ton more.\n\n2. Offline Maps\nUnlike Fotospot, our Joshua Tree photo guide works even when you don't have a working cell signal (and that's basically the entire park).\n\nOne-time payment:\nWe don't have any upsells, in-app purchases, or subscriptions in this app, so for a simple one-time purchase, all of this can be yours for life. Plus, you'll automatically get any new future attractions we add to the app for FREE!\n\nLeave no trace:\nWhen visiting any attraction (in our app or not) please be responsible and leave it exactly how you found it. Take only photos and leave only footprints. To learn more please visit LNT.org.\n\nHappy exploring,\nThe Fotospot Team\n\n#fotospotting\n#fotospotapp"

      "label": "Love exploring Death Valley but hate that you can't get a cell signal in the park, making it nearly impossible to find the best sights? Well, today's your lucky day!\n\nIntroducing our new offline Death Valley National Park (and surrounding areas) photo guide. Now you can get all the great photos, content, and exact locations that you already love in Fotospot, but with one big difference - offline maps! When you have a working WiFi connection, simply download our offline guide to your device and, like magic, the app will now work when you don't have an internet connection. You'll be able to check in, save attractions for later, add new photos, and - best of all - find the exact locations of all the coolest Death Valley spots including Zabriskie Point, Darwin Falls, Natural Bridge Death Valley, Artist’s Palette, and Badwater Basin - all without having a working cell signal!\n\nPlease note, some of these attractions can be found in our flagship app, Fotospot, but with two huge differences:\n\n1. Exclusive Content \nSome of the coolest (and hardest to find) attractions can only be found here like Teakettle Junction, Mosaic Canyon, Keane Wonder Mine, Sidewinder Canyon, Aguereberry Point, and the Leadfield Ghost Town, plus a ton more.\n\n2. Offline Maps\nUnlike Fotospot, our Death Valley photo guide works even when you don't have a working cell signal (and that's basically the entire park).\n\nOne-time payment:\nWe don't have any upsells, in-app purchases, or subscriptions in this app, so for a simple one-time purchase, all of this can be yours for life. Plus, you'll automatically get any new future attractions we add to the app for FREE!\n\nLeave no trace:\nWhen visiting any attraction (in our app or not) please be responsible and leave it exactly how you found it. Take only photos and leave only footprints. To learn more please visit LNT.org.\n\nHappy exploring,\nThe Fotospot Team\n\n#fotospotting\n#fotospotapp"

      "label": "TrekRight: West Highland Way is a comprehensive, incredibly handy mobile app for anyone walking all or part of the West Highland Way or exploring the beautiful region around the trail. \n\nTrekRight includes an in-depth reference 'Trekopedia' (communities, B&Bs / hotels, attractions, services, points of interest, etc.), supports customizable routes, interactive maps (including detailed offline maps), directions and section-by-section guide, dynamic trip stats for your current section, stage, and route, an intelligent compass that shows the right direction based on your current location and chosen route, and more.\n\n# The Right Information, When You Need it\nLocation-aware information – TrekRight provides you with information tailored to your current location. If you are approaching Drymen, TrekRight will tell you how far you still have to go, what points of interest are available around you, where you can find a pub, options for where to stay the night, easy access to interactive elevation profile charts, and clear, detailed directions. You can easily see what things you flagged as interesting, which things you added notes to, and which you marked as favourites. Real-time information that keeps you completely on top of things!\n\n# Trekopedia\nTrekRight’s ‘West Highland Way Encyclopedia’ is packed with extensive interactive reference information, organized into Communities, Accommodation, Attractions, Services, Points of Interest, and Route Sections. Everything can be searched and filtered, viewed on a map, notes can be added (anything from a simple reservation number to a copy-and-pasted blurb from a website), and more. Handy information (literally) at your fingertips!\n\n# Interactive Map / Offline Maps\nPowerful, flexible map built on top of our high-quality mapping engine, with full support for detailed offline map imagery. Displays your current location on your selected route along with pins showing all the locations included in the Trekopedia (just touch a pin to open its related Trekopedia entry). Our offline maps mean you don’t require Internet access to use the mapping functionality. Online maps are also available for when you have an Internet connection. Easily filter and do searches. Scroll, zoom, and rotate the map and (in online maps) configure to show street maps, satellite view, terrain, or a hybrid. Completely transform how you ‘see’ your surroundings on the West Highland Way.\n\n# Intelligent Compass\nIn addition to all the standard compass functionality, TrekRight’s intelligent compass also points you in the right direction based on your current location and your selected route, and updates dynamically as you move. Two special compass indicators are available – one points towards the end point of your current section (typically the next town on the route), and the other points which way you should go now, taking into consideration all the twists and turns in your route. Never get lost again!\n\n# Pre-Departure Planning & Preparation\nTrekRight makes it easy to plan your route (including configuring the sections you want to follow), organize it into stages, and review distances and elevations (including a handy interactive Elevation Profile Chart). Comes pre-defined with popular routes (full and partial). Review and rank hotels / B&Bs, flag locations of interest as ‘favourites’, add your own notes, and more. Be prepared!\n\n# Up-To-Date Content\nTrekRight’s content is regularly being updated and expanded based on the latest information available to us. You can check for content updates directly inside TrekRight and download our database whenever it is convenient for you (even on the trail), without having to connect to the App Store. Always be up to date!\n\n--- No Internet Connection Required ---\nAll of TrekRight's content is stored directly on your phone, including our detailed offline maps (once downloaded). No Internet connection is required unless you want to use the online maps."

      "label": "•THIS APPLICATION IS FOR DISNEY WORLD IN FLORIDA. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR DISNEYLAND IN CALIFORNIA, CHECK OUT OUR OTHER APP \"HIDDEN MICKEYS: DISNEYLAND\"•\n\nThere's an extra special way to enjoy Walt Disney World and this app is your guide. Hunting for \"Hidden Mickeys\" (images of Mickey Mouse cleverly concealed in WDW's theme parks, restaurants, hotels, and other areas by Disney artists and designers) is fun for all and a bona fide vacation mission for many Disney World fans.\n\nServing as the OFFICIAL application to Steven Barrett’s bestselling book “Hidden Mickeys – A Field Guide to Walt Disney World's Best Kept Secrets,” the mouse hunt is taken to a whole new level of interactivity with this application for iPhone and iPod Touch! \n\nUtilizing GPS tracking [iPhone only], your location is scanned and immediately lists the closest Hidden Mickeys to you. If you’re not in the parks, or if you’d rather scroll through the different locations, you are able to browse categorized lists of each Hidden Mickey location. Keep track of which Mickey’s you find with an easy to use built-in scoring system. Keep in mind – this is a scavenger hunt! The score counts if you want it to, so do your best and try to use the least amount of hints as possible.\n\nWhether you’re playing solo or with the whole family, you are able to keep separate user profiles to keep track of everyone’s progress. Spanning all four parks and documenting over 1200 Hidden Mickeys, this application will add a whole new level of entertainment to your trips to Disney World!\n\nIn this application you'll discover well over 1200 Hidden Mickeys throughout various locations at the Walt Disney World Resort including:\n• Magic Kingdom Park \n• Epcot\n• Disney's Hollywood Studios\n• Disney’s Animal Kingdom\n• Blizzard Beach & Typhoon Lagoon Water Parks\n• Disney Springs\n• EPSN Wide World of Sports\n• Miniature Golf Courses\n• Over 20 DIFFERENT Disney Hotels\n\nPLUS: tips, hints and author Steven Barrett's very own favorite Hidden Mickeys. We've also included the use of Game Center, which allows you gain achievements while playing! We've even hidden a few of these that can only unlock from certain places inside the park - can you get them all?\n\nTrue to their name, Hidden Mickeys are elusive. New ones appear from time to time and some old ones disappear. When that happens — and it will — Steve will let you know on his web site: www.HiddenMickeysGuide.com. Periodically, the application will be updated to reflect these changes, becoming your best source for all things Hidden Mickeys!\n\n“Hidden Mickeys” is based off of the newest and most comprehensive edition of the book. “Hidden Mickeys – A Field Guide to Walt Disney World's Best Kept Secrets” 8th edition can be found for sale throughout Disney World, in stores, or online at Amazon.com."

      "label": "MetroBuddy is your subway ride's best friend. In cities like New York where you have to swipe your transit card to unlock the turnstile, forgetting your balance and being greeted by an \"insufficient funds\" message can be annoying, and delay your journey.\n\nMetroBuddy lets you enter your current MetroCard balance, and update it each time you swipe. Never lose time at the MetroCard reader again, your balance will always be available on your phone! The app also calculates how many rides you have left, based on your fare. Use the History tab to review the changes you made to your balance.\n\nMetroBuddy also provides Siri shortcuts to record a swipe and check your balance. This enables you to build powerful automation for your commute, such as recording a swipe, starting your favorite playlist, and checking the next train departure.\n\nIf you are using iOS 14 or later, you can add a widget to your home screen or your widget center to view your balance even faster.\n\nWe are proud to be working on making MetroBuddy as inclusive as possible. You can change your fare if you have a more affordable one. The app is also fully compatible with iOS assistive technologies such as VoiceOver, Dynamic Type, and VoiceControl. Turnstiles are not fully accessible, but MetroBuddy is.\n\nDo not hesitate to reach out with feedback and/or questions by e-mail at hi@alexisonline.dev.\n\nPlease note that MetroBuddy is a hobby app and is not affiliated with New York's MTA in any way."

No waiting for data, ads or being thrown in a queue.\n\nPlease read to know why this app is unique.\n\n- This is a independent app that is like no other. It is about choice, not deals.\n\n- REAL hotel phone numbers. The data is on the app so you don't have to wait or hunt for phone numbers.\n\n- REAL website links directly to each property.\n\n- You book direct over the phone or their official website, NOT the app. The app does not do booking and you are not queued up overseas by a third party.\n\n- Easily find favorite chains with map filters or a manual lookup by chain. Like our website, no one else lets you find Ritz-Carltons or Motel 6 together. The choice is yours.\n\n- Filter by brand umbrella. Prefer to gets points at only Marriott brands? Hyatt? Choice? See just the overall group you want.\n\n- Filter by amenity. Look for a pool, restaurant, internet, fitness center, business center, extended stays, pet friendly or truck/bus parking.\n\n- Includes a independent category that has many hotels and motels you won't find in other apps.\n\n- No ads inside the app or corporate deals to throw certain brands at you and hide others.\n\n- We are not making money on every booking like other apps do. No preferred brands to push on you.\n\n- This app is universal for all iOS devices. Most locators are not.\n\n- Find the nearest ones to you right now on the map view. Tap the compass button to re-center around you at anytime. You don't need a zipcode.\n\n- Planning ahead for other places? Type a city in the search box and jump there on the map.\n\n- No service to display maps? Use the in-app manual lookup. This is a big reason. Other hotel apps always require internet service. When you want to find something, you want to find it fast no matter what.\n\n- Tap a location for more information such as distance from your current location, phone number, address, directions, important amenities and the official website, photo search and review search.\n\n- Easily report errors, changes, closures or post important comments from each locations detail view.\n\n- It does not do everything that other apps already do. This is for when you know the type of hotel that you want and you just want to find it fast.\n\nFor all features and best results, a GPS enabled device is recommended but this is designed to run on all devices. The data is stored locally on your device. Using the manual lookup button, you can find places by state and city without internet service. You can list all places or just one preferred location.\n\nThis data is USA only right now.\n\nThis app is completely ad and sponsor free but you can connect to the official websites of the hotel companies and reviews. THEY may have ads on them and we don't control those companies and how they present their own data.\n\nAllStays LLC is a independent travel site that lists all types of lodging."

Yes, it can be a lot to cover. So, spread it out over a couple of days, take a break for lunch, or maybe stop at one of the Smithsonians along the way. It's like having your own personal tour guide, at a fraction of the price. \n\nTwo Buck Tours include maps with GPS, directions, photos, tips, interesting information about each site, and are narrated in English.

      "label": "Excited to take the Pacific Coast Highway from Morro Bay to Monterey (or vice versa), but nervous you won’t have cell coverage for most of the trip? Well, we’ve got you covered!\n\nIntroducing our new offline California Route 1 Road Trip photo guide. Now you can get all the great photos, content, and exact locations that you already love in Fotospot, but with one big difference - offline maps! When you have a working WiFi connection simply download our offline guide to your device and, like magic, the app will now work when you don't have an internet connection. You'll be able to check in, save attractions for later, add new photos, and - best of all - find the exact locations of all the coolest PCH spots including Morro Rock, Moonstone Beach, Hearst Castle, McWay Falls, the Bixby Creek Bridge, and the Lone Cypress (plus, all 17 spots along the 17-Mile Drive) - all without having a working cell signal!\n\nPlease note, some of these attractions can be found in our flagship app, Fotospot, but with two huge differences:\n\n1. Exclusive Content \nSome of the coolest (and hardest to find) attractions can only be found here like the Los Osos Bear, the Giant Chessboard, Morro Rock Cairns, the Cayucos Shipwreck, Nitt Witt Ridge, and the Hearst Castle Zebras, plus a ton more.\n\n2. Offline Maps\nUnlike Fotospot, our CA-1 Road Trip photo guide works even when you don't have a working cell signal.\n\nOne-time payment:\nWe don't have any upsells, in-app purchases, or subscriptions in this app, so for a simple one-time purchase, all of this can be yours for life. Plus, you'll automatically get any new future attractions we add to the app for FREE!\n\nLeave no trace:\nWhen visiting any attraction (in our app or not) please be responsible and leave it exactly how you found it. Take only photos and leave only footprints. To learn more please visit LNT.org.\n\nHappy exploring,\nThe Fotospot Team\n\n#fotospotting\n#fotospotapp"

No Login. \n\nNow in their 11th year as a mobile app, and their 13th online, the Wise Pilgrim Guides are the go-to source of up-to-date information on the Camino de Santiago.\n\nThe app is updated regularly with new content and new features and offers you the ability to leave tips for pilgrims following behind you.\n\nThis guide covers the Camino Francés, the most popular route across Spain. It has been redesigned and now works almost exclusively offline (to share your comments with others will require a data connection).  As more an more albergues share their WiFi this becomes less of an issue, and the guide will tell you which ones offer WiFi.\n\nAccommodation Directory:  \nA full directory of Albergues, camping, hotels, pensions, paradors, and cases rurales.  Over 900 in total, with special attention to those that can be booked online.\n\nStageless Guide:\nNo more \"stage anxiety\" or guide created bottlenecks.\n\nMaps:  \nOffline and online versions of a beautiful topographical may will give you a good view of the terrain ahead.\n\nPhotos: \nPhotos of albergues, monuments and other points of interest along the way.  Currently 900+ images and growing.\n\nScrollable Elevation Map:  \nThis one is hard to show with just a screenshot, but the elevation that appears at the top of every city page scrolls East to West.  One complete elevation, from St. Jean Pied de Port to Santiago, uninterrupted by page folds.\n\nComments:  \nAlbergue closed early for the season?  Have a restaurant that you want to share, or perhaps one to warn others about?  Every location in the app gives you the opportunity to leave a comment and to read the comments left by others. No registration necessary.\n\n¡Buen Camino and thank you for your support!"

Enter your flight details, and using real flight data, the app perfectly demonstrates the unlikelihood of your flight going down.\n\nHow safe is your next flight? \n\nCrashes may make the headlines, but they’re incredibly rare, and when they do happen, seldom lead to injury. With those facts, there’s no need for nervous flyers to fall back on anything but the statistics. Am I Going Down? will tell you how and why you have only a millions-to-one chance of crashing, allowing you to fight fear with information.  \n\nNew York Times\n“In most cases a normal flight will give you a one in five million, or one in 10 million, chance of crashing, so that tends to reassure most people.”\n\nThe Economist\n\"[The app] wants to reassure nervous flyers that they are all but guaranteed to reach their destination in one piece.\"\n\nDaily Mail\n\"'Am I Going Down?' app uses real flight statistics to analyse flight safety.\"\n\nBustle\n\"One of the only sources providing such in-depth coverage of safety statistics in the aviation world.\"\n\nAlso featured in: CNN, Washington Post, Daily Telegraph, Quartz, Forbes, Newsweek, Gizmodo, Business Insider, Gadget Show, and many more! \n\n—\nDisclaimer: While \"Am I Going Down?\" is based on published flight and crash statistics to give an indication of flight safety, the app is intended for entertainment purposes only.

      "label": "Twiz puts the fun in functionality!  Simply pick a starting location (where you are) and then pick the place you want to get to.  Mr. Wizard will promptly make fun suggestions about how to get there using Transportation.  Mr. Wizard also estimates how long it will take to get there..  By tapping on the route, you get lots of helpful tips about the transportation system and you can share your experience of times and tips with other users.\n\nImagine you are on your first trip to the Grand Floridian.  You arrive at your hotel, unpack your bags and call your friends who happen to be staying at the Boardwalk Inn.  You decide you want to meet for dinner at the Flying Fish café… but you don’t have a car, and you have no idea how to get to the Boardwalk from the Grand Floridian.  You whip out your iPhone and the WDW Transportation Wizard comes to your rescue; promptly suggesting several routes involving boats, buses, or monorails.  He even tells you how long it’s likely to take so you won’t be late for dinner.  Thank you Mr Wizard!\n\nOr, perhaps you are a veteran of Disneyworld and love planning daily itineraries.  You plan your trip, making a careful schedule of where to eat and which parks to go to when.  You decide that a fun day at the Hollywood Studios would really be nicely topped off by dinner at Chefs de France.  But how long is it going to take to get there, and what is the funnest possible route (this is a vacation after all!)?  You pop out your iPhone and fire up the OLP WDW Transportation Wizard who gives you several recommendations.  Oh my gawrsh, I didn’t know you could take a boat from the Studios to Epcot!  That sounds like fun!  But I will have to allow at least 37 minutes for that trip so we better leave by 5PM to make sure we are in time for dinner at 6PM.  Thank you Mr Wizard!\n\nThe OLP WDW Transportation Wizard puts the magic of trip planning in your pocket.\n\n\n\nThe OLP TWiz is based on a program written in 1998 using a proprietary technology.  OLP Twiz has been thoroughly tested by thousands of happy users.  You can see the original twiz at ourlaughingplace.com where it is still in use today.  Lucky for you, you can now carry it around on your iPhone or Touch for ready access.\n\nReview from meltdowndisney.com: \nApp alert: The OLP WDW Transportation Wizard for Walt Disney World is the best way you are going to invest 8 quarters. After searching for this functionality in a site, which I really thought I had seen, I noticed this app during a buying binge last week.\nEven from my couch, I could figure out how to get from Pop Century to The (Real Fantasyland of) Grand Floridian for a pedicure, without scuffing my toes. Especially if you have a child who is committed to taking a particular mode of transportation, this app will give you best case scenario guesses on how long it will take get from point a to point b. Wish I’d had it on my last trips, as does the restaurant manager who smiled as I explained that we took a bus, then a boat to the character meal that was about to close, instead of a plain old bus, which according to “Twiz” would have saved us about 25 minutes. Did I mention it was $1.99? Yes, U.S. $1.99, but still. If you are traveling with a small group, one might suffice. If you are traveling with anyone in my family, make sure everyone has one (especially if you plan to split up for a few hours for naps or swimming) so you don’t have to share, or wait at the turnstile for that last little straggler getting off the boat. Saving time is saving Disney Dollars. Invest."

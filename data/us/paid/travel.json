      "label": "There are 140+ audio points that play automatically along the scenic drive, featuring the best things to see and do, stories, tips and driving directions.  \n\nProfessional tour guides share advice on how to prioritize your time at recommended “not to be missed” viewpoints, suggested side-trips and places of interest.\n\nTours work offline, using free GPS signal and location services, so no data roaming, network, or wifi is required while touring.\n\nVisit www.gypsyguide.com for route maps, sample audio, tips and advice and what to know before you go.\n\nIt’s Just Like Having a Tour Guide in Your Car™\n\nWHAT TO EXPECT:  \nThe Road to Hana is one of the world’s most scenic drives and a popular sightseeing activity to see Maui’s spectacular waterfalls, black sand beaches, bamboo forests, lava rock formations and amazing ocean views as you wind your way through 620 curves and 59 bridges.\n\nIf you prefer travelling independently, at your own pace, GyPSy Guide provides the best Road to Hana tour experience, along with the freedom to choose what you enjoy; squishing the black sand between your toes at Wai’anapanapa, hiking the Pipiwai Bamboo Trail, or maybe time to enjoy an extra slice of banana bread.\n\nYou can’t help but cheer on the world class windsurfers at Ho’okipa.  And you won’t need to worry about photoshopping the Rainbow Eucalyptus at the Ke’anae Arboretum or the stunning contrast between blue water and black lava rock at Ke’anae Peninsular.\n\nTake a moment to cool off with a quick swim at the pristine Hamoa Beach and see where Haleakala National Park descends from the summit to the sea and the “Seven Sacred Pools” of Oheo at the end of the drive.\n\nWith such a long day of exploring (expect 8-12 hours), it’s important to know the 5 “not to be missed” stops, and the many more suggestions if you have time.  Part of the secret to enjoying the journey is knowing how not to waste your time, and we have tips for that as well.\n\nOn the return drive from Hana, we’ll point out the not to be missed stops again as well as tell you stories about Hawaii’s fascinating history and rich culture.\n\nPlease note Highway #31 ‘backside route’ is not recommended for driving. Rental car insurance void.   Road can be closed for repairs, mudslides and flash floods.\n  \nWHAT YOU’LL SEE:\n\nSome of the highlights along the route include;\n\n•\tHo’okipa Beach Park\n•\tPaia\n•\tKe’anae Peninsular\n•\tWai’anapanapa Park, Black Sand Beach\n•\tHana\n•\tHamoa Beach\n•\tWailua Falls\n•\tTwin Falls\n•\tUpper Waikanai Falls (3 Bears)\n•\tPools of O’heo (Seven Sacred Pools)\n•\tPipiwai Bamboo Trail\n\n**Reservations to visit Wai'anapanapa State Park and black sand beach are now mandatory** \n\n\nBATTERY USAGE:\n++  Continued use of GPS/Location Services in the background increases battery usage.  We strongly recommend taking a cigarette style (DC outlet) car charger.  Avoid using a direct connection to the USB port of a rental vehicle.\n\nIPADS:\n** iPad models must include a GPS chip. Please note that Apple only install these on the iPad Wifi + Cellular models.  Wifi only iPad models have limited location service capabilities and are unable to play commentary automatically.\n\nDOWNLOADING:\nThe apps are larger in size in order to work offline.  You must be on wifi to download as the store may block the download over cellular networks.  \n\nABOUT US:\n\nGyPSy Guide™ produce award winning narrated audio tours along scenic drives and road trips around the world.  \n\nEnjoyed by travelers who prefer to set their own pace and itinerary on vacation, but enjoy a fun, informative and educational guided experience while driving themselves.  \n\nOur goal is to provide a great introduction to the region and inspire you to learn more and return.  \n\nNone of our apps include paid advertising or placements for benefit"

Get Airborne.\n\nOr access LOCAL INFO--before you depart, just after arrival--anytime. \n\nMilSpaceA app allows authorized U.S. government users to register for Department of Defense (DoD) military space-available travel. It is the exclusive app for all DoD travelers wanting a quick, easy, reliable, and authorized means to sign up for Space-A at primary departure terminals. \n\nVISITING FAMILY MEMBERS and TDY military & contractors are now using MilSpaceA app as well--there's MUCH MORE here than just space-a signup.\n\nExpanded LOCAL INFO: billeting, car rental, dining, Exchange info, links to air terminals' pages, USOs, & more.\nAIRCRAFT GALLERY: depictions & basic descriptions of DoD pax aircraft\nTRAVEL ADVISORIES - announcements of temporary conditions affecting space-a\nSIGNUP ARCHIVE - stored in-app (as well as in user's own e-mail \"Sent\" items)\nFOREIGN CURRENCY - daily exchange rates for AOIs\nDOCUMENT LIBRARY:  key space-a documents:  policy, guides, handbooks, AMCGrams\nENHANCED ONLINE MAPPING: Your location shown relative to points of interest in the app (requires active geolocation & Internet access). \n\nFirst, browse through \"Airfields of Interest\".  Call ahead to various terminals (call-enabled for iPhone) or visit terminals’ flight schedule pages (if they have them--most don't). Then fill in your details, select departure airfields and destination countries, and send out the signup to register for travel. Some terminals will reply; most will not. Just keep a copy of e-mail(s) as proof of signup.\n\n• Remote space-a signup for multiple airfields. Prepare off- or online--then transmit when you have connectivity.\n• Multi-branch terminal support (Air Force, Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, Guard & Reserve)\n• Complies with Air Mobility Command rules: Signups generated by you, your e-mail as the sender & reply-to address. Copies saved directly in your e-mail Sent items, retrievable anytime.\n• Data privacy: No SSAN required. Exclusive AMC-authorized Pseudo Person ID (PPID) auto-created. (Some Navy locations still insist on SSANs--contact them directly after signup to pass SSAN).  \n• NEW: Now includes optional fields for DoD ID numbers, dates of birth, and passport info.\n• Full control of your data--ability to purge anytime.\n\n***\n\"My mom came to visit me and she used the app, too (...) It's great for anyone visiting [the base].\" - LT\n\"Amazing how easy this app made our trip. This and our books together, because weird or not, I still like the smell of paper\" - JD\n\"Great app. Very easy to use\" - TT\n***\n\nPolicies governing space-a are implemented in DoD Directive 4515.13-R (Air Transportation Eligibility) and AMCI 24-101 Vol 14. Determine your eligibility before registering for travel. CONTACT YOUR LOCAL TERMINAL if you have any questions of eligibility. Refer to http://www.amc.af.mil/amctravel for current official AMC policy. Utilize and support pepperd.com, spacea.net & takeahop.org for unofficial discussions, info, and desktop-based space-a signup.\n\nOnly after mission requirements are met will remaining seats be offered up for space-a. Be prepared for delays or short-notice diversions. Space-A is a privilege, not a right--movement is never guaranteed. UNDERSTAND THE BASICS OF SPACE-A before signing up.\n\nMore about Take-a-Hop--and its MilSpaceA app)\n\nSince inception, Take-a-Hop's platform has generated MILLIONS of space-a signups. Trusted by passengers and passenger service agents (PSAs) alike. Used by tens of thousands of DoD travelers. Solely managed by a USAF veteran who has also traveled military space-a and knows what travelers are up against. MilSpaceA app is not endorsed by the US Federal Government, DoD, or any branch thereof. And still, it's the name recommended by thousands and earning your trust for years.\n\nThanks and Happy Travels!\n\nWEB at www.takeahop.com/app\nLIKE on www.facebook.com/takeahop"

Includes rest areas, truck stops, KOAs, campgrounds and more.\n\nDump station locations are displayed even when offline!\n\nDump station information is obtained from crowdsourcing and are therefore subjective in nature. What one person describes as working another may describe as broken.\n\nFeatures:\n- Location database is included with the app, so all locations are visible when offline.\n- Filter what type of location to display. List only free dump stations from the filter.\n- Show a route between your location and the selected RV dump station.\n- View the dump stations in list view; easily search the list.\n- Get the local weather for the location.\n- Internet searches and more for each location.\n- Import routes from GPX files.  This makes it much easier to find RV dump stations along a route you've created in another app such as Road Trip Planner.\n- Send a dump station location to our app Road Trip Planner.  This helps in routing your travels (requires separate purchase of the Road Trip Planner app).\n\nWe want to expand our RV dump station database as much as possible, so we have made it easy for you to easily submit a new RV dump station - simply tap the + button below the map.  To correct or update dump station information, tap “Location Comment” in the detail view. We will be updating the database often.\n\nDue to the nature of dump stations constantly changing their status it's recommended you contact the dump station prior to using it to verify its existence."

Use the \"Layers\" icon to select which agencies you want displayed to create your own custom map. (Hint, the toggles are color coded to the color each layer is displayed in.)\n\n- Links are provided to each agency's website within the app, so that you can further your research as to what land use rules apply for each public land type - such as permits, fees, activities allowed, and limits of stay.\n\n- Map layers are stored on device - no internet connection required.\n\n- Be sure to turn on the 'Basic' base map to see the US Public Land labels for each land area. This base map layer is also stored entirely on your device, and can be utilized if you do not have an internet connection or would like to conserve bandwidth. \n\n- If you have an internet connection (or have cached them before going out of signal), you can utilize the built in Apple Maps and satellite view maps as the base layer underneath the public land overlays.\n\n- A boondocker's assistant - While US Public Lands is not specifically a camp site locator and does not have a database of specific sites, by turning on the satellite view map, you can better scout out trails, roads and signs of dispersed camping locations within the boundaries of the public land resources. \n\n- Quickly toggle between 'Show' and 'Hide' via the \"Map\" icon to more clearly see satellite images below.\n\n- If you have GPS access on your device, click the 'Locate Me' icon to show your present location - know what type of land you're on right now!\n\n- Built in search tool locates anything on device maps supports (requires internet access) - including cities, states, zip codes, addresses and points of interest. A pin is dropped at the search location.\n\n\nThank you to the Protected Area Database (PAD-US) of the U.S. Geological Survey for providing the public domain raw map data that we’ve been able to utilize to create this interactive overlayable mapping & navigation tool. We will update our maps in the future to stay in sync with improvements to this data set. \n\nPlease note, the USGS PAD-US database contains the “most up-to-date aggregation of Federal lands and waters” available, but this database is still evolving and some locations may not be listed and others may not have precisely accurate boundaries. Resolution across the nation may vary. And always remember - there may be private unmapped inholdings within any public lands - so always pay attention to local signage, indications, and information. \n\nThe US Public Lands app should only be used as an overview, and you should always confirm more precise details by consulting local field offices, administration websites, and other resources. Do not solely rely on this app for determining if you are on public or private land."

In cities like New York where you have to swipe your transit card to unlock the turnstile, forgetting your balance and being greeted by an \"insufficient funds\" message can be annoying, and delay your journey.\n\nMetroBuddy lets you enter your current MetroCard balance, and update it each time you swipe. Never lose time at the MetroCard reader again, your balance will always be available on your phone! The app also calculates how many rides you have left, based on your fare. Use the History tab to review the changes you made to your balance.\n\nMetroBuddy also provides Siri shortcuts to record a swipe and check your balance. This enables you to build powerful automation for your commute, such as recording a swipe, starting your favorite playlist, and checking the next train departure.\n\nIf you are using iOS 14 or later, you can add a widget to your home screen or your widget center to view your balance even faster.\n\nWe are proud to be working on making MetroBuddy as inclusive as possible. You can change your fare if you have a more affordable one. The app is also fully compatible with iOS assistive technologies such as VoiceOver, Dynamic Type, and VoiceControl. Turnstiles are not fully accessible, but MetroBuddy is.\n\nDo not hesitate to reach out with feedback and/or questions by e-mail at hi@alexisonline.dev.\n\nPlease note that MetroBuddy is a hobby app and is not affiliated with New York's MTA in any way."

Well, today's your lucky day!\n\nIntroducing our new offline Joshua Tree National Park (and surrounding areas) photo guide. Now you can get all the great photos, content, and exact locations that you already love in Fotospot, but with one big difference - offline maps! When you have a working WiFi connection, simply download our offline guide to your device and, like magic, the app will now work when you don't have an internet connection. You'll be able to check in, save attractions for later, add new photos, and - best of all - find the exact locations of all the coolest Joshua Tree spots including Heart Rock, Lost Horse Mine, Barker Dam, and Skull Rock - all without having a working cell signal!\n\nPlease note, some of these attractions can be found in our flagship app, Fotospot, but with two huge differences:\n\n1. Exclusive Content \nSome of the coolest (and hardest to find) attractions can only be found here like the Iron Door Cave, Penguin Rock, Eagle Cliff Boulder House, Samuelson Rocks, the Freak Brothers, and Garrett's Arch (the largest arch in the park!), plus a ton more.\n\n2. Offline Maps\nUnlike Fotospot, our Joshua Tree photo guide works even when you don't have a working cell signal (and that's basically the entire park).\n\nOne-time payment:\nWe don't have any upsells, in-app purchases, or subscriptions in this app, so for a simple one-time purchase, all of this can be yours for life. Plus, you'll automatically get any new future attractions we add to the app for FREE!\n\nLeave no trace:\nWhen visiting any attraction (in our app or not) please be responsible and leave it exactly how you found it. Take only photos and leave only footprints. To learn more please visit LNT.org.\n\nHappy exploring,\nThe Fotospot Team\n\n#fotospotting\n#fotospotapp"

Well, we've got you covered!\n\nIntroducing Oahu by Fotospot! Now you can have over 130 of our favorite Oahu, Hawaii photo spots - complete with offline maps, directions, photos, and descriptions - in the palm of your hand. And, best of all? You don't need a cell phone signal for our app to work!\n\nSimply download our offline guide to your phone and, like magic, the app will work when you don't have a cell signal. You'll be able to check in and save attractions, add new photos, and find the exact locations of all the coolest Oahu spots including Kualoa Ranch, Hanauma Bay, Dole Plantation, Diamond Head Crater, and Pearl Harbor - all without having a working internet connection!\n\nPlease note, some of these attractions can be found in our flagship app, Fotospot, but with two huge differences:\n\n1. Exclusive Content\nSome of the coolest (and hardest to find) attractions can only be found here like the Pillbox Hiking Trail, \"50 First Dates\" Breakfast Spot, the Turtle Bay Banyan Tree, the \"Lost\" Camp (and Crash Site of Oceanic Flight 815), and the Stairway to Heaven - plus a ton more.\n\n2. Offline Maps\nUnlike Fotospot, our Oahu photo guide works even when you don't have a working cell signal.\n\nOne-time payment:\nWe don't have any upsells, in-app purchases, or subscriptions in this app, so for a simple one-time purchase, all of this can be yours for life. Plus, you'll automatically get any new future attractions we add to the app for FREE!\n\nLeave no trace:\nWhen visiting any attraction (in our app or not) please be responsible and leave it exactly how you found it. Take only photos and leave only footprints. To learn more please visit LNT.org.\n\nHappy exploring,\nThe Fotospot Team\n\n#fotospotting\n#fotospotapp"

No data connection required when you are on the path.\n\nWhile on the towpath, the C&O Companion will display your current location, and will help you find amenities along the way.  It also has self-contained maps that do not require a data connection.\n\nIn the event of an emergency, the C&O Companion will help identify your location, and the quickest way to reach help.\n\nProceeds support the C&O Canal Trust Fund.\n\n=======================================\n\nTroubleshooting: Less than 1-in-500 users have reported one of these problems with the application:\n\na) Won't report location.  If your app is stuck on \"Finding Location\" (and you are not in airplane mode), then this generally means that you did not allow the C&O Companion access to your current location.  (A dialog box will ask your permission during first launch). This is easy to fix.  Just open the \"Settings\" application (this app came with your device; it has the gray \"Gears\" icon) and look for \"Location Services\".  Ensure that Location Services is ON, and that is has been enabled for the C&O Companion application.\n\nb) Sync never completes.  Just one person reported that after pressing the Sync button, the download never completed.  This is most likely due to a corrupted database.  We fixed this by simply deleting the app and then using the iTunes application to reinstall the app from iCloud (no additional change is incurred for re-install).  This procedure wipes out the database so you can start over fresh."

App includes everything from BLM camping to National Parks.\n\nBUY IT ONCE and get regular free updates.\n\n-This app or the \"Camp & RV\" app?\n\nAlthough Camp and RV has a \"tent\" filter for this same data, you may not ever need RV stuff. This app shows only places that take tents. Even boat and hike-in ones. Camp & RV has more than 4 times the points of this app because it has both tent camps and stuff tenters may not need. The other app has RV only parks, truck stops, rest stops, RV dealers, low clearances, parking lots and much more.\n\n-CAMP & TENT HAS 2 MODES:\n\n-Map view: uses GPS and maps to plot up to 150 points at a time. Starting from your current location, you can zoom out and in or jump to anywhere in the USA and Canada. This mode shows everything. Filter the map to view only what you want: KOA, Forests, BLM, or maybe REI stores.\n\n-City lookup: View text info by state and city. Only looking for State Parks? Find them without internet service!\n\n-WHAT'S IN IT:\n\n-Over 26,000 Tent Campgrounds: (US & Canada)\n-KOA\n-Private\n-State Parks\n-National Parks\n-BLM\n-National & State Forests\n-Army Corps of Engineers\n-Military famcamps\n-County/City Parks\n-Even primitive hike-in/boat-in/rough road spots that other apps exclude. Every point has coordinates, address or directions and phone. 98% have amenities and official website links.\n\n-Expanded detail view lists all amenities. RV amenities are included because it gives you a idea of what to expect. When tent camping, you may want to find the smaller more primitive places with less RV focus. This is a good indicator. Amenities include open season, rate range, sites, water, showers, toilets/restrooms, tables, pool, playground, laundry, pet-friendly, firewood, boat launch, seasonal sites and internet access.\n\n- PLUS Outdoor Supply Stores:\n\n-Camping World\n-REI\n-Cabelas\n-Gander Mountain\n-Dicks\n-Bass Pro Shops\n-Big 5 Sporting Goods\n\nSend in your own additions, reports and app corrections from each detail view.\n\n-HOW CAN THIS APP SAVE YOU MONEY TOO?\n\n-When you find a tent camp in a park behind a store.\n-Find a nice forest site just 2 miles beyond the $40 spot your book lists.\n-Lighten your load and not buy as many books year after year.\n\n-NO WIFI? NO SERVICE?\n\nParts of this app will always work and provide useful information. The data is stored on your phone while the app uses GPS, so constantly calling upon a website for information like other camping apps do is not necessary. This is great for improving speed when you’re in remote places.\n\n-SUPPORTED\n\n** This app is a full time project built for campers by a camper. From http://www.allstays.com, providing camping data for over 18 years. There will be mistakes but they will be fixed on next update. This independent app does not feature or hide any place based on fees or corporate ties. Information is provided. You make the decision.\n\nDon’t take the tent out one more time without Camp & Tent. Or if you use a camper, look for our Camp & RV app. The ultimate outdoor travel app.\n\n** Cell service is required for full GPS functionality. Internet required for maps first view and loading into memory.**\n\nQuestions, comments or requests? Let me know what would make it even better for you. Email: apps@allstays.com for a fast reply."

This same data is part of the \"Camp and RV\" app which has a dump station filter in it.\n\nRV Dumps checks your location and displays up to 150 points on a map view. You can filter by type to see only what you want to see on the map and zoom out. You can also use the offline manual lookup to find locations by type, state and city...even when you have no phone service!\n\nRV Dumps takes the database from the top ranked camping app called Camp & RV and filters all points that have a dump station as an amenity (not \"hookups\" which are at a site. Many parks no longer have stand alone stations.) Maybe you need one and a night stop or you are just passing on through. From Rest Areas to truck stops to private campgrounds (either stay the night or call to see if you can pay a separate fee). From State Parks to even some National Park and Forest campgrounds that have one.\n\nDump stations are being paved over left and right these days. We removed several each day that are found to be closed. Please send in reports and adds. I have hundreds more dump locations that I don't have GPS points for so they can't be placed in the mobile app yet. I keep working on those.\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Search for specific locations around you on a map.\n- One-touch calling for places that have a phone number listed. Good idea to call and ask about the fees as Flying J now charges for it.\n- One-touch turn-by-turn directions for all POIs.\n- Works when iPhone has no phone service.\n- Supports a manual lookup mode where users can look up parks and truck stops that have RV dumps.\n\nUpdates make major changes that early app reviews won't reflect. We added thousands of places like waste water treatment plants, dealerships, gas stations, public places, storage places and stores."

No hidden costs.\nNow in their 11th year as a mobile app, and their 13th online, the Wise Pilgrim Guides are the go-to source of up-to-date information on the Camino de Santiago.\n\nThe app is updated regularly with new content and new features and offers you the ability to leave tips for pilgrims following behind you.\n\nThis guide covers the Camino Primitivo, the original route across northern Spain. It has been redesigned and now works almost exclusively offline (to share your comments with others will require a data connection).  As more an more albergues share their WiFi this becomes less of an issue, and the guide will tell you which ones offer WiFi.\n\nAccommodation Directory:  \nA full directory of Albergues, camping, hotels, pensions, paradors, and cases rurales; with special attention to those that can be booked online.\n\nStageless Guide:\nNo more \"stage anxiety\" or guide created bottlenecks.\n\nMaps:  \nOffline and online versions of a beautiful topographical may will give you a good view of the terrain ahead.\n\nPhotos: \nPhotos of albergues, monuments and other points of interest along the way.  Currently 900+ images and growing.\n\nScrollable Elevation Map:  \nThis one is hard to show with just a screenshot, but the elevation that appears at the top of every city page scrolls East to West.  One complete elevation, from St. Jean Pied de Port to Santiago, uninterrupted by page folds.\n\nComments:  \nAlbergue closed early for the season?  Have a restaurant that you want to share, or perhaps one to warn others about?  Every location in the app gives you the opportunity to leave a comment and to read the comments left by others. No registration necessary.\n\n¡Buen Camino and thank you for your support!"

I purchased the tape 3 weeks prior to flying. On the day I felt great! Boarding the plane OK, Take off 95% OK. Then just to reassure me I listened to the tape during the first 25 minutes flight. Had a brilliant flight………after 12 years of being frightened! What a fantastic feeling to have overcome this fear.\" \nThanks Victoria Brier \n\n\"I listened to this CD 5 days (25 minutes each day) prior to my trip. I had the BEST flight ever! Considering I drove off the last time I was supposed to fly, leaving my husband to board a plane for Vegas by himself, I needed help! This was the absolute best! At first I hated the anxiety I felt listening to the CD. I got over it. I LOVED the flight, looked out the window, actually went to the bathroom. I had a drink on the flight because I wanted to not because I needed it! I came home from my trip and booked two more trips! The freedom is awesome. Go for it!\"\nJo Anne. Denver, CO USA"

You get some rest, maybe shop a bit and move on early in the morning.\n\nHow will this app help you? RVer or not, this app shows all Walmart locations in US and Canada. Use it to find shopping now and for RVing later.\n\nWant to know where every Walmart is located and which ones have been reported to allow and don't allow overnight parking?\n\nFilter map to see if has fuel, pharmacy, garden center, a restaurant and much more.\n\nThis app plots every Walmart store in the USA and Canada on the map view. It uses location services to find your location and as you move.\n\nLocal influence and RVer abuse have meant that about 1/4 of stores no longer allow overnights, so you might want ask a manager ahead of time. Please submit your reports to us so we can keep this app accurate. I get numerous reports about stores every single day. It’s always changing...\n\nWhat's in it: Walmart's of all kinds. Can you park there or have others been denied or even towed? Tips are provided from other RVers as to where to park in the lot. \n\nIt integrates nicely with maps to display up to 150 points of interest on a map.\n\nDon’t take even one more trip without Walmart Overnight Parking. It can always change by the time you get there but at least you can be aware of what others have experienced lately.\n\nAllstays LLC, the provider of this App is not affiliated with, sponsored by or in any way related to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.

      "label": "Excited to take the Pacific Coast Highway from Morro Bay to Monterey (or vice versa), but nervous you won’t have cell coverage for most of the trip? Well, we’ve got you covered!\n\nIntroducing our new offline California Route 1 Road Trip photo guide. Now you can get all the great photos, content, and exact locations that you already love in Fotospot, but with one big difference - offline maps! When you have a working WiFi connection simply download our offline guide to your device and, like magic, the app will now work when you don't have an internet connection. You'll be able to check in, save attractions for later, add new photos, and - best of all - find the exact locations of all the coolest PCH spots including Morro Rock, Moonstone Beach, Hearst Castle, McWay Falls, the Bixby Creek Bridge, and the Lone Cypress (plus, all 17 spots along the 17-Mile Drive) - all without having a working cell signal!\n\nPlease note, some of these attractions can be found in our flagship app, Fotospot, but with two huge differences:\n\n1. Exclusive Content \nSome of the coolest (and hardest to find) attractions can only be found here like the Los Osos Bear, the Giant Chessboard, Morro Rock Cairns, the Cayucos Shipwreck, Nitt Witt Ridge, and the Hearst Castle Zebras, plus a ton more.\n\n2. Offline Maps\nUnlike Fotospot, our CA-1 Road Trip photo guide works even when you don't have a working cell signal.\n\nOne-time payment:\nWe don't have any upsells, in-app purchases, or subscriptions in this app, so for a simple one-time purchase, all of this can be yours for life. Plus, you'll automatically get any new future attractions we add to the app for FREE!\n\nLeave no trace:\nWhen visiting any attraction (in our app or not) please be responsible and leave it exactly how you found it. Take only photos and leave only footprints. To learn more please visit LNT.org.\n\nHappy exploring,\nThe Fotospot Team\n\n#fotospotting\n#fotospotapp"

No Login. \n\nNow in their 11th year as a mobile app, and their 13th online, the Wise Pilgrim Guides are the go-to source of up-to-date information on the Camino de Santiago.\n\nThe app is updated regularly with new content and new features and offers you the ability to leave tips for pilgrims following behind you.\n\nThis guide covers the Camino Francés, the most popular route across Spain. It has been redesigned and now works almost exclusively offline (to share your comments with others will require a data connection).  As more an more albergues share their WiFi this becomes less of an issue, and the guide will tell you which ones offer WiFi.\n\nAccommodation Directory:  \nA full directory of Albergues, camping, hotels, pensions, paradors, and cases rurales.  Over 900 in total, with special attention to those that can be booked online.\n\nStageless Guide:\nNo more \"stage anxiety\" or guide created bottlenecks.\n\nMaps:  \nOffline and online versions of a beautiful topographical may will give you a good view of the terrain ahead.\n\nPhotos: \nPhotos of albergues, monuments and other points of interest along the way.  Currently 900+ images and growing.\n\nScrollable Elevation Map:  \nThis one is hard to show with just a screenshot, but the elevation that appears at the top of every city page scrolls East to West.  One complete elevation, from St. Jean Pied de Port to Santiago, uninterrupted by page folds.\n\nComments:  \nAlbergue closed early for the season?  Have a restaurant that you want to share, or perhaps one to warn others about?  Every location in the app gives you the opportunity to leave a comment and to read the comments left by others. No registration necessary.\n\n¡Buen Camino and thank you for your support!"

To be profitable, Lease Operators and Owner Operators must know their numbers. The cost of operations for your truck is the most important number that Lease Operators and Owner Operators need to know. Without knowing this very important information, then Lease Operators and Owner Operators are more than likely running their loads in the blind and are experiencing unnecessary stress in trying to determine why they are not profitable.\n\nThe Trucking Cost Per Mile Calculator is simple to use and has preliminary information already entered to help Lease Operators and Owner Operators to quickly determine the Fixed and Variable cost associated with their trucking business. Simply delete those entries that are irrelevant and add those that are missing. Determine whether you want to calculate your cost per mile on a weekly, monthly, or yearly basis and enter the cost accordingly. \nThe cost per mile app will automatically calculate your trucking cost per mile for each entry and make the final calculations to show you the cost per mile you need to maintain in order to remain profitable.\n\nLease Operators and Owner Operators can also visualize the cost of their trucking operations by viewing automatically updated charts associated with their fixed and variable cost so that they can make adjustments to their cost per mile based on those cost which are eating up their generated revenue earned on the loads they run.\n\nSupport: We are available by email or telephone.

Rain? Take a break and resume the tour later. All tours have maps with GPS, directions, audio narration (in English), photos and text. It's like having your own personal guide, at a fraction of the price. No schedules, no crowds, no worries."

My users include avid RVers who roam from region to region and need to locate available TV networks, and homeowners setting up a new antenna system. \n\nApple Watch (Series 5) users can make use of their compass with the optional in-app purchase of an embedded watch app. \n \nThere is an alternate compass tab which shows the direction of stations within a 45 mile radius—given enough screen space—just look over your phone to see which way to point your antenna.\n\nPinch to zoom into your locality, or hit the circular location button to concentrate on local stations. If more than 80 stations are in the area being viewed, a random assortment of 80 stations will be displayed.\n\nThere is no \"phoning home\" with data, personal or not.  If a data connection is available, the FCC servers will be asked for contour plot data when a tower is selected. This will show up as a blue overlay showing the calculated area over which the signal will drop off by at most 35 dBu. Basically, this is the area where an antenna not too near the ground has a chance to receive the signal; your luck will vary. Once downloaded, the data is stored for the next time you select the tower.\n\nErrors and omissions are to be expected especially for stations with low power licenses. Please e-mail the support address if you find a glaring omission or error; I'll need a call sign and a TV network."

WiFox Premium detects the airport you're at and displays the most relevant wifi network name and password so you can get online as soon as you step off the plane.\n\n* View password ratings to see which passwords work best throughout an airport so you can connect to the strongest and most reliable connection.\n\n* Be able to add your own password ratings within WiFox. Premium user priority ratings ensure the best wifi passwords are always displayed.\n\nAfter a 30-day free trial period a $24.99/year purchase will be applied to your iTunes account following confirmation of a Premium upgrade.

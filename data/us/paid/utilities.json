      "label": "Convenience on the wrist - Watch app for Tesla is the ideal companion in day to day life with your Tesla vehicle. These are just a few of the day to day conveniences this app will help achieve:\n\n - Pair your watch as a proper vehicle key, just like your phone! Works under all conditions, including in underground parking garages or in the middle of a desert!\n\n - Forgot to plug in? Get a notification if vehicle is in a pre-configured location and not plugged in - all done directly on the watch, no external servers required, keeping your privacy!\n\n - Add the graphic corner complication to your watch face and enjoy the convenience of having easy access to state of charge, charging indicator, time remaining if charging, sentry mode active indicator and indicator if any windows, doors or trunks are open. All from one complication, that also will launch the app when tapped. \n\n - During and after charge, a panel will show how much energy was added. Convenient if you schedule your charge during the night - wake up each morning and easily check how much energy was added to the battery. \n\n - If you have multiple vehicles on your account, tap the vehicle name to quickly and easily switch between them. \n\n - You can queue up commands by tapping on buttons, then put your wrist down and the commands will execute in the background when the vehicle is successfully woken up. \n\n - When you tap the unlock vehicle button, the charge port will also unlock if a charging cable is attached. That's convenience right there!\n\n - Want to reduce phantom drain? Background updates can be configured to longer intervals between updates or to only update if car is already awake or can be disabled entirely for absolutely zero impact on phantom drain.\n\n - A warning panel will show up if any doors, windows or trunks are left open. Conveniently, you can tap the panel to close any open windows.\n\n - Need to access the frunk? Just do it from your wrist - no fiddling with your phone. \n\n - Sitting comfy in the couch, but just remembered you have a road-trip in the morning? Set the charge limit to 100% - or any value really - and start charging, right from the convenience of your wrist!\n\n - Leaving the office after a long hot day? Activate the HVAC when you're on your way, and enjoy a nice cool vehicle.\n\n - When charging, tap the time remaining label to switch to show time of expected completion - no more head calculus!\n\n - Need to run a quick errand, but you don't have your phone? Unlock your vehicle from your wrist, then activate remote start and off you go. Just please be mindful that this feature requires internet connectivity on both watch and vehicle - so don't drive into the desert and leave your vehicle, or you'll get stuck there!\n\nA note about security and privacy:\nThis app accepts two types of login. Either Tesla account credentials or a Tesla API token. Your account credentials are never stored in the app, but are used only once to obtain an authentication token and refresh token directly from the Tesla API server. If you would rather supply that token yourself, you can do so instead. It is required to supply a refresh token. Your token will be persisted in the app. Tokens will be revoked if you change your Tesla account password. No network traffic will ever be emitted from this app that goes anywhere other than directly to the Tesla API servers, unless the OPTIONAL cloud processing is enabled, in which case an in-flight encrypted ACCESS token with a lifespan of 8 hours will be transmitted and stored ONLY WHILE COMMAND IS EXECUTING. The source code for this application will at all times be made available to any security researcher for a voluntary security and safety audit. \n\nDisclaimer: \nThis app is not endorsed by Tesla Inc. Use at your own risk. No guarantee of proper function is given. Only you are responsible for any changes to your car caused by using this app.  \n\nMade in Denmark"

Please do not use VPN, Proxy, VLANS and Subnets.\n\n* Latency is supreme (below 1 second) when you have good wifi network conditions\n\n* No hidden subscriptions or costs\n\n* If a third party app, for example Spotify, does not mirror sound correctly, please FORCE CLOSE and restart Spotify while the mirroring session is active. Please check the Apple Support page to learn how to FORCE CLOSE an app: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201330\n\n* Black screen issues: Some third party apps prevent screen mirroring. When you try to mirror them, you will just see a black screen on your TV, for example with Netflix and Disney+. This is a restriction chosen by Netflix and others, so we cannot fix it at the moment.\n\n\nIf you like the app and our constant work on it, please give the app a positive rating on the App Store. Many thanks in advance from the development & support team.\n\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Google or any other trademark mentioned here. Chromecast is a trademark of Google LLC."

      "label": "Necrophonic is an ITC app used for spirit communication and EVP research.\n\n8 Sounds Banks:\n\nThe audio has been mastered in a way to bring out various sound properties . \nUsing Pro Tools I was able to enhance high, mid, and low range frequencies. I also applied \nother filters to create unique sound characteristics to help layer the audio and create an \nenvironment suitable for spirit communication.\n\nThe audio itself is made up of phonemes, \npartial words, reverse audio, foreign languages, and other parts of speech that can help \nspirits communicate. Besides some basic phonetic sounds such as na, no, da, do, di, ma, may, etc.\nthere are no real words of phrases contained in the banks.\n\nThese sounds banks play in a similar\nway to that of my other app \"Spiritus Ghost Box\" but instead of 4 sound banks Necrophonic has\n8 active sound banks.\n\nWhite Noise Sound Bank:\n\nThis app also has an optional 9th sound bank called \"White noise\". \nThis bank can be used alone or with the other 8 giving you a total of 9 sound banks. This \naudio is taken for the internal sounds of the famous DR60 recorder that is known as the \n\"Holy Grail\" of EVP recorders. This is not a White Noise Generator, this is a normal sound bank like the others but this one contains white noise from the DR60.\n\nAudio Effects:\n\nThis app does contain Echo and Reverb audio effects. These have been proven \nto be the best effects to apply to ITC sessions. The echo can create audio that can be \nmanipulated within the echo itself. Echo can also help in live, real time communication by \nrepeating the audio and allowing you to better hear whats coming through. Reverb can be \napplied to the audio to create a spacious sound environment that will enhance audio manipulation."

      "label": "Noir is a Safari extension that automatically adds a dark mode to every website you visit.\n\nIt makes browsing the web at night so much better. With Noir, you won’t be blinded by bright websites ever again.\n\nAnd the results look great too. Noir generates a custom dark style for each website you visit, based on the colors that are used on a page. You won’t even notice this happening in the background – that’s how fast it is – but you’ll certainly appreciate the end result: a beautiful dark mode tailored for each website, where contrast is preserved and highlights still pop. And with over 20 built-in themes and the ability to create your own, you can customize the results exactly the way you want.\n\nNoir works with any website you visit in Safari, automatically. By default, Noir is linked to your device’s Dark Mode, so websites will only go dark when you want them to. But you can easily customize this to your liking, even per website. Only want to use Noir on just a few specific websites? Sure thing! Disable Noir on some websites? No problem!\n\nBuilt from the ground up for iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, the app feels right at home on your device. It supports the brand new Safari web extension feature, which means there’s no need to manually activate it every time you load a new page. The app also tightly integrates with system features such as Focus Filters and Shortcuts to fully integrate Noir in all your workflows. And your settings are automatically synced to all your devices using iCloud.\n\nAnd just as importantly, Noir takes your privacy seriously: it doesn’t collect any of your browsing data. Period.\n\nNoir is made by a solo iOS developer. It does not include any subscriptions or ads. Buy Noir once, use it forever.\n\nNotes:\n• Found a website where Noir’s dark mode doesn’t look just right? Let me know by reporting it. The app will be frequently updated to address issues that are reported.\n\nPrivacy Policy:\n• The Noir extension requires access to the websites you visit to analyze the existing style of the page and to override it with Noir's dark style.\n• Noir never collects your browsing data. The only data Noir ‘collects’ are your settings, and those will never leave your device.\n• You can read Noir’s full Privacy Policy at https://getnoir.app/privacypolicy"

      "label": "This tool shows you the ultimate precise time of day. To achieve this, it uses a special internet time protocol to fetch the time from an atomic time server.\n\nWe are proud to offer version 5 of the Gorgy Timing Atomic Clock. The program is one of the classic applications since the early days of the Apple App Store and has been continually improved based on user feedback.\n\nThe Gorgy Timing Atomic Clock shows the precise time of day. To achieve this, it uses a special internet time protocol to fetch the ultimate precise time from cesium atomic clocks available on the internet, or any other time server you like.\n\nThe graphical display mimics the clock display of the legendary Gorgy Timing clocks, which are used in professional radio and television studios, and we spent much effort to bring the original feeling of these wickedly expensive clocks to your iPhone. This app is used by BBC studios, astronomers, concert promoters, etc. \n\nVersion 5 contains the following functions:\n\n* Universal support for all iPhone, iPad and iPod touch devices running iOS 8 or higher (including iPhone 11, 11 Pro, 11 Pro Max, and all of the latest iPads and iPads Pro)\n* Optimized for iOS 13 and watchOS 6, full 64 bit support\n* Alarm function with snooze (touch anywhere on the screen), volume fade-in, based on weekdays\n* Alarm time based on seconds (not minutes)\n* Local time / UTC time mode\n* Alarm notification window instead of normal alarm sound, if app is not running or in the background\n* Use playlists or a manual picker selection from your own music library as alarm sounds\n* The alarm sound is also playing when the device is muted, or the display is switched off, and also works in AirPlay environments\n* Customizable time server sources\n* Colors: green, red, blue, yellow, white, dark green, violet, pink, orange, turquoise and hidden, with a separate color option for digits, seconds and segments\n* Alternative visual display of fractional seconds (1/60th sec. resolution)\n* 12/24 hours display\n* Optional second tick sound\n* Full landscape support (including settings dialog)\n* Touching the display lets the buttons and status bar fade out\n* Touching the display again will add the current date (in all orientations)\n* Disabled screen auto-lock\n* Options \"sync at startup\", \"hourly\", \"daily\", or a sync button for manual syncing\n* The last known time delta is used when started without sync\n* \"Night mode\", which dims the display using a slider, shows the seconds with only one dot (to prevent a hard brightness switch between second 59 and second 0), switches off the tick sound, and reduces screen updates to save battery\n* To minimize burn-in effects (especially on the iPhone X OLED display), the clock is doing micro movements when running longer than 5 minutes\n* VoiceOver support\n\nAnswers to common questions:\n\n* An application can not set your device's system time, so a time sync between the atomic time and the device time is not possible.\n* If you want to wakeup with music, please do not exit the app before going to sleep (which would result in a local notification dialog without music in the morning), and do not lock your device. Be aware that running an application all the time, even without display, consumes battery, so please make sure that your iPhone is fully charged before you go to bed, connect it to your charger, or use the app's Night mode, which is much more energy-saving."

      "label": "Anyone can make their own tunes in Forza. It comes down to doing the right math, taking a test drive and knowing when to make a few adjustments. Nothing magic. ForzaTune Pro does the complex math for you, and makes it easy to adjust the car to your driving style and skill.\n\nTell ForzaTune you're driving a Supra on the streets of Mexico, and it creates a tune to match. If you prefer a more aggressive or more stable feel, then open up the tune customizer to set oversteer or understeer in each part of a turn. ForzaTune works out the new values for you automatically.\n\nThere's nothing better than driving a car dialed in how you want it. And a car that feels planted lets you drive faster.\n\nThis Pro version includes many extra tuning types like rally, drag and drift plus gearing options, the ability to save tunes, and finer control over your tune balance.\n\nHere are the complete specs if you'd like to learn more:\n\nONE APP TO TUNE THEM ALL\nForzaTune Pro has support for Forza Horizon 5, Forza Horizon 4, Forza Motorsport 7 and also includes most vehicles in Forza Horizon 3 and Forza Motorsport 6.\n\nMAKE STREET, DRIFT, RALLY TUNES AND MORE\nNo matter what kind of driving you like, this tuning app has you covered. Create standard (street/track), drift, drag, rain, rally/snow, and off-road tunes with ease.\n\nLEARN HOW TO QUICKLY FINE-TUNE\nAdjust the overall balance, turn entry balance, turn exit balance, ride stiffness, roll stiffness in seconds.\n\nRETUNE GEARS WITH EASE\nIncludes a gearing calculator option that lets you match race transmission values to engine swaps or major power upgrades. \n\nTUNES ARE TAILORED TO EACH CAR\n1140+ vehicles covering Forza Horizon 5 back through Forza Motorsport 6. Tuning for some special editions (F&F, Team Forza, FE) is done with the base car unless noted otherwise. ForzaTune does not include oval racing vehicles or tuning.\n\nACCURATE FORMULAS\nForzaTune Pro combines your input with its vehicle and track databases to create original, balanced tunes. Formulas are based on real race engineering. They are also tested extensively with a gamepad and steering wheel/pedal set.\n\nSAVE AND MANAGE YOUR TUNES\nSave, edit, search and backup all of your tunes. Export and import options let you transfer your tunes to new devices or friends easily without logins or accounts.\n\n-----\nFAQs\n-----\nQ: Is this for beginners or experienced tuners?\nA: Both. Experienced tuners use it to save time. Newer tuners use it to learn how to tune.\n\nQ: How do I use the app?\nA: Copy several car details from the game into ForzaTune, hit \"Next\" and copy the results into the tuning menu in Forza Horizon 5 or an earlier Forza title. There is also a series of video tutorials on YouTube to get you started.\n\nQ: What settings and upgrades do I need?\nA: You will need racing upgrades like suspension, braking, anti-roll bars, and differential to change the values in the tuning menu. You can also use drift, rally and adjustable stock suspensions when available (like off-road buggies and some trucks in Horizon). You will also have the best results if you disable stability management (STM) and traction control (TCS) for lower class cars. Normal or simulation steering is fine, but simulation steering is recommended in FH5 especially when fine-tuning.\n\nQ: Why is tuning your cars important?\nA: When doing upgrades many of the default tune settings will not match the new build. ForzaTune brings it back to a balanced setup. Also, tuning doesn't affect your PI or race restrictions—so this is how you can gain an advantage over other racers.\n\n---\nMake better tunes faster with ForzaTune Pro."

All watch complication types are supported, including those really weird ones.  Also you can change the complication icon under Settings;\n7. The watch app can listen automatically on launch. There is an option under settings to do the same thing on the iPhone;\n8.

You can change the language that you speak and hear responses in, under \"Settings\" on the watch and phone.  Only languages supported by Alexa are supported. The language should be set automatically.\n\nIf you have questions or any support issues please don't hesitate to email damian@voiceinacan.com ... you should get a response within 24 hours, and often in minutes.\n\nThis app was not created or endorsed by Amazon.

      "label": "***THIS APPLICATION DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY SERVER SIDE SERVICE***\n\nQuantumult is a powerful proxy client.\n• Right now supports protocol Shadowsocks(r), HTTP, HTTP over TLS, SOCKS5 and SOCKS5 over TLS, VMess.\n\nIt can capture all the TCP traffic and redirect under you own way by using Filter function.\n• The filter has a few types to match. For TCP traffic that has the upper layer protocol HTTP(S), 'HOST', 'HOST-SUFFIX', 'HOST-KEYWORD', 'USER-AGENT', 'GEOIP' and 'IP-CIDR' are all supported. For the other TCP traffic, 'GEOIP' and 'IP-CIDR' are supported. Especially, when deal with HTTP(S) traffic, Quantumult has another function called Rejection, it matchs the whole URL of the HTTP(S) request.\n• After match, the filter has a lot of actions to deal with the request, built-in policy 'DIRECT', 'REJECT', 'PROXY', all your servers and your customized policies. Actually you can see all the actions as a lot of paths and you can decide which request goes through which path by using filter function.\n\nMore over, Quantumult can be a convenient web develop tool on mobile device.\n• When you on the road without the Mac platform debug tools like Charles and Wireshark, you still can use Quantumult to log parts of the web request to debug some web issues.\n• Quantumult can log all the HTTP(S) request header and response header.\n• Yes, you are right it can log the HTTPS request header and response header, be sure to install and trust Quantumult root CA for this advanced function.\n\nSince quantumult has a function called PROXY, sure it can redirect your traffic to remote proxy servers. But be clear, we do NOT provide any server side service or support, you should build your own servers.\n• Like we said early Quantumult can redirect all TCP traffic through the filter function, that means you can visit different web site through different servers by the filter. See it can accelerate your network connection if you set your filter right, and of course the filter is totally customizable.\n• About the customized policy, there are 3 different types of customized policy, 'SSID', 'Latency' and 'Static'. The 'SSID' policy depends on your network enviroment, Wi-Fi, Cellular or specific Wi-Fi with the SSID your provided. The 'Latency' policy is based on the latencies of all the servers of the policy settings, the result is the shortest(The test interval has the option of 600 or 1200 seconds). The 'Static' policy is based on your manual selection of servers or other polices from the policy settings. Sure you are right, some of polices can wrap other polices, convinent, right ?\n\nAbout working state, Quantumult can work in 3 state, 'GLOBAL', 'DIRECT' AND 'AUTO'.\n• The GLOBAL state will ignore filter settings and redirect all TCP traffic through the built-in PROXY policy(you need build and add your server first).\n• The DIRECT state will ignore filter settings and redirect all TCP traffic directly to the destination web site. How this state useful ? Yes, it can be a simple web develop tools by analizing the reqeust header and response header including HTTPS.\n• The AUTO state, we call it auto because it base on the filter you set to divide the TCP traffic through different paths, like the popular ACL way.\n\nExtra, Quantumult can also work as a HTTP proxy server for devices under the same Wi-Fi, when this function is turned on, the home view will show the IP and port for other device easily to connect.\n\n\nAt last, some attentions.\n• About the location on the map of home view. It is not the real location in the real world, it's just the IP location and might not be correct."

      "label": "StopTheMadness is a Safari extension that stops web sites from making your browser harder to use. And it protects your privacy on the web. StopTheMadness is not an ad blocker: it offers unique features not available from ad blockers or any other apps. StopTheMadness is one of a kind!\n\nMade by indie developer Jeff Johnson. The support link has documentation and my email address.\n\nMany web sites deliberately disable user interface features in Safari that you normally expect to work. StopTheMadness re-enables those features for you in Safari:\n• opening contextual menus\n• selecting, copying, cutting, and pasting of text\n• drag and drop\n• AutoFill/autocomplete of passwords, emails, etc.\n• 2-finger click to open a link in a new tab\n\nStopTheMadness also protects your privacy on the web:\n• Stops Google AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages)! Automatically loads the original \"canonical\" web site page instead of Google AMP.\n• Removes tracking tags such as utm_source, gclid, and fbclid from the end of URLs.\n• Stops clickjacking in Google Search, Gmail, Facebook, and DuckDuckGo.\n• Stops hyperlink auditing (anchor \"ping\").\n• Stops tracking beacons (Navigator.sendBeacon).\n• Stops sites from using the Page Visibility API to know when a tab is visible on your screen.\n• Stops URL shorteners. Checks the links you click in Safari for well-known link shorteners — bit.ly, tinyurl.com, l.facebook.com, t.co, etc. — and loads the unshortened destination URL instead of the shortened URL. This occurs without setting any cookies or other site data, so you can't be tracked by your click.\n\nBonus Features:\n• Stop videos from autoplaying. This works even on sites where Safari doesn't stop autoplay, such as YouTube. And YouTube video ads are automatically skipped! Also stops videos from following you down the page when you scroll on many sites.\n• Stop sites in Safari from pausing your audio in a background app such as Apple Music.\n• Show native video controls. Use Picture-in-Picture from Safari on sites that don't normally support it, including YouTube!\n• Automatically select the highest video quality on YouTube!\n• Hides the annoying popup banners prompting you to get the app on Google, Google Maps, DuckDuckGo, IMDb, Instagram, Quora, Reddit, and Tumblr!\n• Font replacement. Substitute one font for another on web pages, such as Helvetica for Arial and Courier for Courier New.\n• Add your own site-specific CSS and JavaScript to web pages!\n• Custom URL redirects! Redirect new Reddit to old Reddit, Twitter to Nitter, YouTube to Invidious, etc. You can create any redirect that you want!\n• Stop keyboard page zoom. Stops the page from zooming in when you show the software keyboard!\n• Enable pinch-to-zoom on sites that prevent it, such as old reddit.\n• Stops \"Are you sure you want to leave this page?\" alerts. Close your tabs without getting stopped by the site!\n• Force external links to open in the current tab instead of a new tab. Remove target=\"_blank\" from links so that they no longer automatically create a new tab.\n• Force external links to open in a new tab instead of the current tab. This is great if you're scrolling through a list of links and want to open each one in a new tab.\n• Force images to the front. Bypass the transparent overlay on sites such as Instagram that prevents you from dragging and opening the contextual menu on images.\n• Warns when you paste or type beyond the maximum length in a password field or other text field. Stops you from accidentally losing characters!"

Measurements are displayed on top of a target curve, making it easy to see where adjustment is needed.  Multiple measurements can be averaged to fully capture how the system sounds in the listening area.  With small changes and repeat measurements, you can manually tune your system to the target curve.  If your audio system has a parametric equalizer or convolution engine, HouseCurve can automatically generate filter settings to match the target curve.\n\nHouseCurve can help with home and car audio system tuning, from system equalization and room correction to subwoofer time alignment and speaker placement.  Visit housecurve.com for more information on how HouseCurve works and how to use it.\n\nFree trial - visit housecurve.com and give the HouseCurve app clip a try.\n\nHouseCurve will produce acceptable results with the built in iPhone/iPad microphone. Using calibrated external microphones will provide higher accuracy."

The breakdown reports how many hours you worked and, depending on the option, the summation of hours and cash.\n\nIt is highly recommended that you setup your specific details in the Settings App of the device you are using. These details include:\nYour home patrol boro, your yearly income, and your reference number (important if you want to be sure you are paid on time).\n \nYou can change your desired time increment settings by going to the Settings App on your iPhone. \nTap: Settings > JobTime > 5 Minute Increments (ON or OFF). \nOFF allows 1-minute increments if so desired. \n\nIt's recommended to change your time format to 24-Hour Time so that you can feel more comfortable with the iOS device overall. \nTap: Settings > Date & Time > 24-Hour Time (ON). \n\nYour comments and suggestions are appreciated and are taken into consideration with each release."

      "label": "V1Driver is designed to add intelligence to your Valentine One Radar Detector so you can enjoy your Drive.\n\nIt adds 3 forms of automatic muting (all selectable by Band):\n\n1) By Speed (Savvy Emulation), if you are under the specified speed it will keep the Radar Detector muted.\n\n2) By Time, it will AutoMute after a specified time.\n\n3) By GPS Location, by long term tracking. This tracks hits of the same frequency in the same location spread over several days before considering it for lockout. If a signal later becomes absent it will remove the lock.\n\nV1Driver takes the infamous V1 \"Arrows\" to a new level by displaying the bogeys on a 2 dimensional map. So you can track how close they are before waiting for the arrows to \"flip\" direction.\n\nIt has extensive audible options. Including Text-To-Speech of Band and Frequency. Audio can optionally use Hands Free Protocol (a phone call) on your car or motor cycle.\n\nThis app is compatible with all iPhones and iPads that support iOS 9.0 or greater that include GPS. It will work in any orientation. An active cellular connection is not required. For viewing the map or backing up to the iCloud you will need a Data connection, but that is not required for day to day operation.\n\niPads that do not have Cellular Chips have no GPS chip and will NOT work.\n\nThis requires a Valentine One Radar Detector that is compatible with Valentine Research's Bluetooth LE Dongle. You should have Valentine Research's V1Connection App (freely available in the App store) operational before purchasing V1Driver.\n\nV1Driver will automatically connect to the Valentine One Bluetooth LE Dongle in the background. This feature of watching for the Bluetooth Dongle when away from your car does not use the GPS, uses very little battery and can be disabled if you wish.\n\nThere is no guarantee V1Driver won't lock out an undesired signal. But it should clean itself up over time if it does.\n\nOther features include:\n\n- Alert Notifications with \"Mute\", \"Lock\" or \"Snooze\" acknowledgment\n- Alerts are iWatch compatible\n- Manual Mute (with automatic unmute from other bands)\n- K/Laser Snooze feature (for when stuck behind BSM or LEDs)\n- Live Map showing learning and unlearning process as V1Driver does it's thing\n- Live Alert status on the Map (strongest threat only, mirrors V1 display)\n- Compatible with Hardware version of Savvy and still Band selectable\n- Signal Strength meter with higher resolution than 8 fixed levels.\n- Rate of Ramp Up on Main threat and each Bogey on the Bogey Map.\n- iCloud Backup and Restore of your Database and Settings\n- Two Level Savvy Speed Setting (Startup and Quick Override) with automatic Reset and integrated current Speed\n- Extensive Data Filtering on the \"Pin Map\" to closer inspect what V1Driver is doing.\n- Delete unwanted individual or groups of pins or any \"filtered\" view directly on the Map.\n- View detailed information on any collected data point (Pin) from the Map\n- \"2nd Chance\" review of Manual Lockouts by allowing user to delete them within 24 hr's before they become permanent\n- Savvy Warmup feature to allow GPS to get good lock but keep detector quiet in false dense areas (e.g. Parking Garage)\n- Integrated help on each control throughout the app.\n- Savvy GPS Learning, it can learn what you set your Savvy Setting to and reapply it on your next trip to the same location.\n- User Settable GPS Accuracy.\n- Instant Replay that captures all events in real time all the time and can be played back at any time.\n- Live Histogram of your signal strength also shown as color intensity on your route on the Map\n- Support for Ku Band for European Users\n- Demo mode that uses the \"Instant Replay\" feature that has Speed, Location, Direction and Alerts, etc. of a real encounter. It will even drop \"New Pins\" along the route.\n- Support for \"White Areas\" these are designated areas like Police stations that you never want to lock out\n\nNote: \"Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\""

      "label": "TslaMirror for iOS \nTslaMirror is an App that will help your iPhone App mirroring to Tesla vehicle! Also, it can support App screencast to a Chrome browser.\n\nFor Tesla vehicle built-in browser\n1 Make sure the car is PARKED (0mph/0kph)! \n2 The Tesla vehicle network must be connected to the iOS device Personal Hotspot (cellular data needed) first. Tesla MCU2 hardware is needed. MCU2 is available on the Tesla Model \n3 Model Y, Model X (late than March 2018), Model S (late than March 2018), or the Tesla vehicles that are upgraded to MCU2 from MCU1.3 Start the TslaMirror App. Confirm \"Tesla Proxy\" switch is on in the TslaMirror App\n4 Click the \"Start\" button, then click \"Start Broadcast\" to start Screen Broadcast in the TslaMirror App\n5 Access the link http://240.3.3.3 via Tesla vehicle in-car browser\n6 Pinch the Tesla vehicle built-in browser screen to zoom in/out the picture\n7 There is no audio support for the moment. Only the App screen will be mirrored to the browser. You can use the Bluetooth audio link to the Tesla vehicle play the audio of the iOS device simultaneously during the App mirroring.\n8 Do not lock the screen. The Screen Broadcast API limitation needs the screen to keep unlocked. Once the screen is locked, Screen Broadcast needs to be restarted.\n\nFor normal desktop browser\n1 Devices are on the same Wi-Fi network\n2 Start the TslaMirror App.\n3 Click the \"Start\" button to start Screen Broadcast in the TslaMirror App\n4 Access the link below the \"Stop\" button via a normal desktop browser (Safari or Chrome)\n\nKey Features\n1 No extra internet traffic for the screencast, the App mirroring traffic is only locally on iOS device Personal Hotspot. However, please note that during the screenshot, the Tesla vehicle will use the hotspot traffic for its internet access when the hotspot is connected\n2 No extra hardware needed\n3 Private, the screencast is only available to the devices connected to the iOS Personal Hotspot Wi-Fi network\n4 Fast network\n5 5GHz Personal Hotspot(iPhone 12 series supports it) Wi-Fi is highly recommended. Do not enable the \"Maximize Compatibility\" setting for iPhone 12 series. By default, iPhone 12 series come with a 5GHz Wi-Fi Personal Hotspot. Once the \"Maximize Compatibility\" setting enabled, it will go back to the 2.4GHz Wi-Fi hotspot.\n\nFAQ\n1 This is not CarPlay\n2 iOS Apps that use the AVPlayer framework cannot be supported, such as the Apple Music App and Netflix App. For the Apple Music App, although the screen can be streamed to the browser, the audio part will be muted during the Screen Broadcast.\n3 Netflix App not supported\n\nPrivacy/Security notice: This App does not collect any statistics, personal information, or analytics from our users.This Application does use Location service to access Wi-Fi access point network name on iOS 13 or later.

      "label": "The \"International Steam Tables - IAPWS-IF97\" app has been developed by active members of the International Association for the Properties of Water and Steam (IAPWS) at the Zittau/Görlitz University of Applied Sciences. The research group at the Department of Technical Thermodynamics in Zittau participated in the development of the \"Industrial Formulation IAPWS-IF97 for the Properties of Water and Steam\" and developed four supplementary standards for backward equations.\n \nThis universal app can be used on iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch, and is designed for comfortable use. The calculations of the thermodynamic properties are based on the Industrial Formulation IAPWS-IF97 and cover its full range of validity. In addition, transport properties, thermodynamic derivatives, and backward functions can be calculated.\n\nThis app is intended to be used by students and engineers in their daily work.\n\nTo learn more about the \"International Steam Tables - IAPWS-IF97\" app visit our website www.thermodynamics-zittau.de for a detailed User's Guide.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\nFeatures of the \"International Steam Tables - IAPWS-IF97\" app:\n \nThe following combinations of input variables can be chosen:\n \nPressure p and temperature t\nPressure p and vapor fraction x in wet steam region\nTemperature t and vapor fraction x in wet steam region\nPressure p and specific enthalpy h\nPressure p and specific entropy s\nSpecific enthalpy h and specific entropy s\nSpecific internal energy u and specific volume v\nSpecific enthalpy h and specific volume v\n\nThe user just edits the values of the input variables and all results are calculated automatically. See the screenshots below this text for details.\n\nDepending on the given pair of input variables the following properties will be calculated:\nPressure p or saturation pressure ps\nTemperature t or saturation temperature ts\nVapor fraction x\nSpecific volume v\nDensity rho\nSpecific internal energy u\nSpecific enthalpy h\nSpecific entropy s\nSpecific isobaric heat capacity cp\nSpecific isochoric heat capacity cv\nIsentropic exponent kappa\nSpeed of sound w\nIsobaric cubic expansion coefficient alpha_v\nIsothermal compressibility kappa_t\nThermal conductivity lambda\nDynamic viscosity eta\nKinematic viscosity ny\nPrandtl number Pr\nThermal diffusivity a\n\nThe calculated properties are displayed in a scrollable view. The user just needs to scroll down to see all the results. See the screenshots below for details.\n\nIf the user switches from one input variable combination to another the previously given or calculated values will be assigned to the new input values and the output is being calculated automatically. For example, if the user calculates a certain state point from pressure p and temperature t and switches to a calculation from pressure p and specific entropy s afterwards, the previously calculated value for s (from p and t) will be assigned as input value for s. This eases the calculation of thermodynamic processes in which one property is kept constant, e. g. of an isentropic expansion.\nThe user can choose SI or I-P unit systems. In addition a variety of other units are available,\ne.g. \nK, °C, °F, °R for Temperature, \nMPa, bar, psi, atm for pressure,\nkg, lb for mass, \nkJ, Btu, ft lbf, kcal for energy.\n \nAll units can be selected independently but the user might also switch between SI and IP unit system for all properties with just one tap. See the screenshots below this text for details.\nUnit conversions will be effective immediately.\nA detailed User's Guide explains the features and capabilities of this App. View the User's guide online on www.thermodynamics-zittau.de."

      "label": "Apart from the most reliable app for polar alignment (with or without a polar scope), PS Align pro has become the astronomer's swiss-army knife with all the tools added over the years. Remember, all features & updates are free forever, the only in-app purchases are donations (tip jar).\n\nPolar Scope Align will calculate the position of Polaris or σ Octantis in your Polar Scope reticle for your location (using your phone's GPS or manually), allowing a quick and accurate polar alignment. It is one of the few programs that are accurate in lower latitudes by correcting for atmospheric refraction (so expect results to agree only with precise software and not most simplistic \"polar align\" apps - see the \"Accuracy\" section in help for details). In the settings you can select the polar scope reticle that matches your own, from a vast collection:\niOptron old & new, Astro-Physics RAPAS & PASILL, various versions of Takahashi EM-10/11/200/400/500, NJP, PM-1, P2-Z, the latest Orion / Skywatcher, the Classic Skywatcher / Orion / Celestron / Meade / EXOS2 / Bresser, the Telrad, Rigel QuikFinder, a couple for Astrotrac / Losmandy / Kenko / Avalon, the Vixen PF-L/Atlux/SX/SXD/SXP/AXD/GP/GP-DX/Polarie Polar Axis Scopes, a Konus and several Polar Finders: Tuthill, Explore Scientific 8x50, Meade 9x60, Vixen Polaris, Celestron 7x50, Carton Optical. PoleMaster help view for South Hemisphere users. If you have one not included, just ask the developer to add it!\n\nFeature list:\n\n-Accurate calculation of Polaris or Sigma Oct for any date and location, including effect of atmospheric refraction (and annual aberration, nutation). Most other apps do not perform precision calculations, so please only compare app readings to accurate sources (USNO, scientific software etc).\n-Use device time/date/location, or enter your own, or pick from online & offline world databases via the Location Manager.\n-Approximate daytime / no polarscope polar alignment tool. Great for visual use, solar imaging (inc. eclipses) and even limited short focal length astrophotography. Now with sun shadow calibration for more accuracy!\n-Laser / Hop Align for nighttime alignment using a calibration star for obstructed or not visible polar star, or for improving laser align.\n-Full app in red-color (or alternative green, white) night mode - tools switchable to daytime view.\n-Deep Space Object (DSO) Database with 22000+ objects from several catalogs (Messier, Caldwell, NGC, IC, Herschell 400, Sharpless 2, Barnard), along with stars (Yale Bright Star) & planets. Search, apply filters, sorting, download DSS color images for all items, or get help finding them with your non-goto telescope with the Push-To function.\n-Connect to and control WiFi-enabled iOptron mounts.\n-Over 30 calculators useful for observing and astrophotography, from eyepiece magnification and field of view, to imaging resolution and reducers.\n-Xasteria: World astro-weather report based on 7Timer! data\n-Water vapor satellite images.\n-List of visible ISS and bright satellite passes.\n-Moon phase & lunar Calendar with solar/lunar rise/set and twilight times.\n-Wizard to calculate your reticle centering offset and correct or compensate for it.\n-Zoomable reticle view and customized routines & tools: Alt-az alignment error display for mounts that calculate it after star alignment (e.g. iOptron iEQ45, CEM60), polar alignment when your scope is not in zero position (for mounts like iOptron ZEQ/CEM on which you can always access the polar scope), remember zero position on Celestron / Skywatcher / Orion etc reticles.\n-Bubble level (using either gyro or accelerometer) and Compass heading, as well as magnetic declination reading.\n-GPS accuracy & elevation data.\n-Red/White/LED light.\n-Dimming slider.\n-iOptron, NexStar and Meade LX200 Star Lists.\n-Support for iPhone & iPad from iOS 9 (and iPod Touch, except tools that require the compass)."

You just supply the contents and select label type - AddressLabels does the rest.\nCompatible with the mac app via Cloud syncing.\nExcellent for organising Christmas card or other mailing lists. No more forgetting to send a card – use your list year after year.\nNo. 1 iPad Utilities App last Christmas on USA and UK stores.\nMost Avery label sheet types supported.\nSupports Brother label printers (wifi).\nSupports some Dymo LabelWriters though also requires 3rd party software (see website).\nPrints to wide variety of envelopes - even custom sizes. Note: whilst working on most printers, it is not guaranteed to work on all printers.\nAddressLabels remembers the settings, making the next job even easier.\nImport names from Contacts, spreadsheet csv files or type manually.\nPersonalize labels with image/photo e.g. Christmas icon\nCreate Return address labels.\nSort on First/Last Names, post/zip code, manually or Birthday (really handy for Birthday List)\nThe zip sort lets you target your mailings to specific neighbourhoods and can be especially helpful in the USA allowing you to get the lowest possible postal rates for bulk mail.\nCreate simple Custom labels e.g. for produce labels, storage boxes etc.\nRecord when cards have been written, mailed, hand-delivered or sent as eCards, and number of replies.\nNumber of stamps required displayed.\t\nPrint directly from your device via Airprint-enabled printer.\nShare - e.g. email or airdrop list.\nExport to csv.\nStore  extra info e.g. children names etc.\nMultiple uses - Christmas, Thanksgiving, Birthdays, Weddings, Baby Showers, storage jars, file labels etc.  - use your imagination.\nLists sync with other iOS devices and Mac (iOS 13 or later). \nCheck person’s history e.g. to see when they last sent you a card.\nUse “alias” e.g. import  “John Smith” from Contacts, but display and print “The Smiths” etc.\nUse person's nickname/company for label/envelope\n****************************************************************\nInstructions on using the app at https://ios.addresslabels.app\nGreat support available - support@ios.addresslabels.app\n***************************************************************\n\"This app, however, is nothing short of brilliant, easy to use and printing sensible labels.\"\n\"This app certainly takes the pain out of producing your Christmas and other lists. A lot of thought has gone into this truly excellent product.\"\n\"This is a superb program and does what it says simply and efficiently. The developer responds promptly to suggestions. Importing Contacts works well and changes are instantly carried through. My cards have never been sent out so early!\"\n\"I love how this app has streamlined addressing my Christmas cards!! Thank you!!\"\n\"AddressLabels delivers an extremely effective way to manage card lists which means the ability to easily compose lists from your Contacts, get the labels printed, and keep track of cards received and sent! Add the ability to manually enter list members, assign nicknames, select from multiple addresses, intelligent handling the country portion of the address, accommodate a large range of label types, AirPrint directly or produce a PDF of the labels, clone new lists from existing lists, all wrapped in a visually pleasing interface. Winner!\"\n\"I hate addressing my Christmas cards. This app made it very easy to make labels. I don't have a printer that works with my iPad yet, so I really appreciated having the capability to send them as a PDF to my email address. The app is awesome...\"\n“Just what you need at this time of year - a reliable self updating list to speed up sending out cards. This is the 3rd or 4th year I've used it and it just gets better and better.”\n“After years of tearing my hair out trying to get labels out of my iphone/iPad/iMac combo, an app that actually does what it promised!”"

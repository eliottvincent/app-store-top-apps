      "label": "RadarScope is a specialized display utility for weather enthusiasts and meteorologists that allows you view NEXRAD Level 3 and Level 2 radar data along with tornado, severe thunderstorm, flash flood, special marine and snow squall warnings, and predicted storm tracks issued by the U.S. National Weather Service. It can display the latest reflectivity, velocity, dual-polarization, and other products from any NEXRAD or TDWR radar site in the United States, Guam, Puerto Rico, Korea, and Okinawa, as well as data from Environment Canada, Australian Bureau of Meteorology, Finnish Meteorological Institute, and German Weather Service radars. These aren't smoothed images, this is native radar data rendered in its original radial format for a high level of detail. \n\nWhether you are scanning reflectivity for a mesocyclone's tell-tale hook echo, trying to pinpoint the landfall of a hurricane's eye wall, or looking for small features like velocity couplets in the storm relative radial velocity product, RadarScope gives you the power to view true radial weather radar data.\n\nRadarScope displays tornado, severe thunderstorm, flash flood, special marine, and snow squall warnings issued by the U.S. National Weather Service. You can browse the list of active warnings, select a warning to view the details, and even zoom to the selected warning on the map.\n\nPinch or stretch to zoom in and out. Drag your finger around the map to scroll. Tap the radar sweep button in the toolbar to switch radars. Select one of the 289 different radars in the United States, Canada, Australia, Germany, Korea, Puerto Rico, Guam, or Okinawa. Plot your current location by tapping the location button and optionally report it to the Spotter Network. Tap the play button to download and animate over recent images. Display the names of over 25,000 cities and towns on the map as you zoom and scroll. Tap and hold the color legend to see the data values. \n\nMeanwhile, RadarScope will retrieve and display updated data automatically and intelligently (approximately every 2 to 10 minutes, depending on the radar scan strategy). \n\nYou can display radar data from our servers, NOAA's public access web site, or your Allison House subscriber account. Spotter Network members can report their location and view the locations of other spotters.\n\nRadarScope Pro is an optional auto-renewing subscription with two different tiers to choose from.\n\nRadarScope Pro Tier One is an annual subscription that provides access to real-time animated lightning data and up to 30 frames of radar data, including extended loops of super-resolution data. Tier One subscribers can also access a data interrogation tool to quickly determine data values for specific radar pixels and an optional dual-pane mode for viewing two radar products side-by-side.\n\nRadarScope Pro Tier Two is an annual or monthly subscription that combines all the features in Tier One with more advanced features, including 50-frame loops, SPC outlooks, special weather statements, mesoscale discussions, local storm reports, hail size and probability contours, and azimuthal shear contours in the U.S., a 30-day archive of all radar products, a 2-year archive of NEXRAD Level 3 radar products, a full historical archive of NEXRAD Level 2 products, and the ability to use subscription features across multiple platforms.\n\nIf you choose to buy the RadarScope Pro subscription, it will charged to your iTunes account. The subscription will be auto-renewed within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period at the same price you originally paid. Subscriptions may be managed and auto-renewal disabled via your iTunes Account Settings after the purchase. Once purchased, the subscription cannot be cancelled during the active subscription period.\n\nDTN is committed to safeguarding your privacy online.

      "label": "Thanks to everyone for making MyRadar so successful, with over 50 million downloads!\n\nMyRadar Pro is IDENTICAL to the free version of MyRadar; it comes without the ads by default.\n\nMyRadar is a fast, powerful, easy-to-use weather app that displays animated weather radar around your current location and to quickly show what weather is coming your way. Just start the app; your location pops up with animated live radar, with radar loop lengths of up to two hours. This basic functionality provides the quickest way to get a snapshot of the weather on-the-go, and it's what has made MyRadar so successful over the years. Check your phone and get an instant assessment of the weather that will impact your day.\n\nIn addition to the live radar, MyRadar has an ever-increasing list of weather and environmentally-related data layers that you can overlay on top of the map;  our animated winds layer shows a breathtaking visual representation of both surface winds and winds at the jetstream level; the frontal boundaries layer shows high and low pressure systems as well as frontal boundaries themselves; the earthquakes layer is a great way to stay on top of the latest reports on seismic activity, completely customizable as to severity and time; our hurricane layer allows users to stay on top of the latest tropical storm and hurricane activity throughout the world; the aviation layer overlays AIRMETs, SIGMETs and other aviation-related data, including the ability to track flights and display their IFR flight plans and paths, and the \"wildfires\" layer allows users to stay abreast of the latest fire activity around the United States.\n\nMyRadar also has the ability to send weather and environmental alerts, including alerts from the National Weather Service, such as Tornado and Severe Weather alerts. A new feature introduced in this version of MyRadar includes the ability to receive alerts based off of Tropical  Storm and Hurricane activity;  you can configure the app to send you an alert any time a tropical storm or hurricane forms, or is upgraded or downgraded.\n\nOne of the most useful features in MyRadar is the ability to provide advanced rain alerts; our patent-pending process for predicting hyper-local rainfall is the most accurate in the industry. Instead of having to check the app all the time, MyRadar will send you an alert up to an hour in advance as to when the rain will arrive at your current location, down to the minute, including details on intensity and duration. These alerts can be a life saver when you're on-the-go and don't always have time to check the weather - our systems will proactively do the work for you and let you know in advance before the rain hits.\n\nIn addition to the free features of the app, additional upgrades are available, including real-time hurricane tracking - great for the start of hurricane season. The hurricane tracker provides additional data above and beyond the free version, including the cone of probability for tropical storm/hurricane forecast tracks, and it also includes a detailed synopsis from the National Hurricane Center. The premium upgrades also include the professional radar pack, which allows greater detail of radar from individual stations. Users can select individual radar stations around the US, select the radar tilt angle, and also change the radar product being displayed, including base reflectivity and wind velocity - great for experienced weather buffs looks to stay on top of possible tornado formation.\n\nDownload MyRadar today and try it out!\n* Aviation Charts subscription (not required in order to use MyRadar) ($24.99 USD per YEAR)\n* Payments will be charged to your iTunes account\n* Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period\n* Auto-renewal may be turned off at any time by going to your settings in the iTunes Store after purchase.\n\nMyRadar’s Privacy Policy, visit: https://myradar.com/privacy\nFull terms of service: https://myradar.com/terms"

      "label": "*** AeroWeather: for pilots, aviation enthusiasts, and everyone who is serious about the weather!\n*** Current and precise weather conditions (METAR) and forecasts (TAF).\n\nAeroWeather Pro provides quick and intuitive access to METAR and TAF for airports worldwide. Data can be shown in its original (raw) format or as fully decoded and easy understandable texts. AeroWeather Pro is helpful for weather preflight-briefings, but also to just get very precise weather. All weather data is cached for offline access. \n\nIn addition to weather data, AeroWeather Pro integrates also airport NOTAMs (provided by US FAA), webcam images around airports (provided by windy.com), FlightService access (US only), and US ATC delay information (provided by US FAA). AeroWeather Pro also offers built-in groups for earthquakes, nearby stations, and today widget (pre iOS14), which can be individually enabled on the top level view. Besides creating user groups it’s also possible to put stations on the same level user groups (e.g. home base). Depending on your needs, groups can be shown or hidden in the main list view. User groups can also be synchronized via Cloud Kit*. \n\nThe app features a built-in airport database, which includes airport data like runways, sunrise/sunset, twilight times, moon times, timezones etc. \n\nMETAR alert notifications** is another new and helpful feature to stay up-to-date. Define multiple alerts for each station with criteria like: flight rule (US NOAA), wind speed, temperature, pressure, present weather, visibility etc. Notifications will be sent to your device if the criteria is met (e.g., when flight rule becomes IFR).\n\nDedicated METAR/TAF** access is optionally available. METAR/TAF data will come primarily from a certified ANSP (air navigation service provider) and is provided reliably and fast from our dedicated, redundant servers (indicated by blue checkmark underneath METAR/TAF).\n\nThe AeroPix feature offers users the possibility to take quickly picture(s) of the weather at their current location. \n\nAeroWeather Pro comes with an Apple Watch app, which shows either a list of stations as defined in the Apple Watch group or all nearby stations based on the current location. METAR and TAF are displayed for each station. In addition, you can put AeroWeather as a complication in your watch face to stay up-to-date. \n\nAn iMessage app is also included which lets you easily send METAR/TAF of any airport to other users.\n\nPlease consult our web-site for a full description of all features. \n\n* Additional functionality which needs to be unlocked (one-time purchase). These purchases are not transferable between Lite, Pro, and Mac.\n\n** SUBSCRIPTIONS\nAdditional features which generate recurring operation costs for us will be offered within a subscription. The following features are enabled while 'First' subscription is active:\n - Dedicated METAR/TAF data source\n - Meteograms\n - Alert push notifications\n - D-ATIS (bigger US airports only)\n - Area Forecast Discussions (currently US only)\n - Home Screen Widgets for METAR, Plot, Meteogram (iOS 14 or higher)\n - Imagery and Charts (requires 'Captain' subscription)\n - SIGMETs (requires 'Captain' subscription)\n\nAdditional features are also enabled when using AeroWeather Lite.\n\nThe subscription varies in time periods (1 month, 12 months). The subscription is valid in both AeroWeather Lite and Pro. Cross app subscription support is only available if iCloud (with the same Apple ID) is enabled. Previously purchased unlock features are not affected and will work with or without subscription.\n\nAuto-renewal may be turned off at any time by going to your account settings. A payment will be charged to your iTunes account at the end of the free trial period. Your iTunes account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. No commitment - you can cancel any time.\n\nPleas read the full “Subscription Terms of Use” at:\nhttps://www.lakehorn.com/subscription-terms-of-use/"

      "label": "Earthquake Network is the most comprehensive app on earthquakes and for most world countries it is the only earthquake early warning system for receiving real time alerts.\n\nEarthquake Network gives you:\n\n- Real time alerts if you live close to the epicentre\n- Alerts seconds in advances if you live far from the epicentre\n- Real time user reports on felt earthquakes\n- Free earthquake data from 21 seismic networks including U.S., Puerto Rico, India, Indonesia, Turkey, Mexico, Chile, Peru, Ecuador, Argentina, Venezuela, Dominican Republic, Colombia, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, China, New Zeland, Japan, Italy, Croatia, Spain and Greece\n\nThe Earthquake Network research project (https://www.sismo.app) aims at developing a smartphone-based earthquake early warning system able to detect earthquakes in real time and to alert the population in advance. Smartphones are able to detect earthquakes thanks to the accelerometer on-board each device. When an earthquake is detected, users with the application installed are immediatly alerted. Since earthquake waves travel at around 5 km/s it is possible to alert the population not yet reached by the damaging waves of the earthquake. For the scientific details about the project please refer to the scientific paper on Frontiers at https://bit.ly/2C8B5HI\n\nSubscriptions:\n\nWhen an earthquake is detected in real time by smartphones near the epicenter, the server sends an alert to all users with the app. Alerting all users can take up to 10 seconds since it is not technically feasible to do so instantly. Now you can join the priority lists of the first 10,000 or 100,000 people alerted in real time. The following subscriptions are available:\n\n- Subscription 10k for 1 year\n- Subscription 10k for 1 month \n\n- Subscription 100k for 1 year\n- Subscription 100k for 1 month \n\n• Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\n• Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n• Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal\n• Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase\n• Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n\nPrivacy: https://www.sismo.app/privacy\n\nTerms and conditions: https://www.sismo.app/terms-conditions"

Live, with alarm, Telegram messages and emails.\n\nI can send you a notification with useful details so to know what is happening, but first you need to make sure that an internet connection is live.\n\nI live in iOS, meaning iPhones, iPads & iPods are my natural habitat! The oldest device I can live in is one with iOS 10.3.4, like an iPhone 5. Just leave the device charging, set up your settings & press the blue thunder.\n\nI will handle the rest. Happy to help!\n\n\nIT’S FOR THE ONE WHO :: \n• Has delicate electrical equipment that power failures might destroy them\n• Has his/her equipment destroyed from power failures (e.g. fridges)\n• Needs to be notified when power has failed\n• Needs to know the duration of power failures\n• Thinks safety is above all\n\nWHY IS USEFUL ::\n• Will wake you up when sleeping\n• Will send you an email when power has failed\n• Will send you an email when power has been restored\n• Handy in areas with tornados or earthquakes (usually power fails before the tornado).\n\nHOW IT WORKS?\nJust insert the charging cable and press play or thunder (electrical power symbol). The moment the power fails it gives you an audible & visual alarm. You will definitely be awake even if your sleep is deep. Press \"TEST\" and see for yourself. Will also send you Telegram & email notifications, just set them up correctly first.\n\nAnd when the power is off, the flashlight is there in the same screen for your convenience, in order to navigate in the dark.\n\nIDEAL OPERATION SCENARIO ::\n• Find a device no longer in use (see list below for minimum)\n• Find a working charging cable*\n• Place it on your place with the delicate equipment (fridges, incubator, dehumidifier, etc)\n• Connect it to WiFi and 3/4G\n• Adjust the Detection Sensitivity if I want to avoid micro failures (less than 3 seconds)\n• Enable & Setup Telegram\n• Enter your email\n• Turn off sound alarm\n• Start monitoring power failures\n• In case of power failure it will send you a Telegram message or email\n• You can then take action as planned for power failures.\n\nDEVICES SUPPORTED ::\n• Any iOS device with iOS 10.3 or Newer\n• iPhone 5 (updated to last iOS) (2012) or Newer\n• iPod Touch 6th Generation (2015) & Newer\n• iPad 4th Generation (2014) & Newer\n• iPad Mini 2 (2014) & Newer\n\nCheck FAQ at App Support Webpage (Information Below)\n\n\n* be aware that the device is in good working condition (ideally hold power & home buttons until you see Apple logo before operation)\n* be sure to use original battery, charging cable & charger to prevent any malfunction if charging for long periods of time.\n\n_________________\n\nIn case you need this app in your language, please contact support."

The wind chill factor can not lower a temperature below the current air temperature, but instead it speeds up the decrease in temperature proportional the speed of the wind\n\nBoth the Old model for calculating the Wind Chill Factor, pre-2001 formula, and the New Wind Chill Index devised by the National Weather Service in 2001 are used. The values are calculated to the second decimal place for extra accuracy.\n\nInputs for Air Temperature can be given as Fahrenheit or Celsius. Acceptable inputs for wind velocity are Knots, Miles per Hour, and Kilometers per Hour. \n\nThis app features: \n\n• Send your calculations or conversions by email \n• Universal App (iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad)\n• All iPhone and iPad screen sizes are supported\n• Retina Display graphics \n• Fast app switching \n• Automatically Saves Your Inputs \n• Latest version of iOS is supported\n\nNo network connectivity required.\n\nNote: Windchill Temperature is only defined for temperatures at or below 50 degrees F and wind speeds above 3 mph."

No other app delivers radar mosaics with this kind of accuracy in such an easy to use package.\n\nIn addition to SuperRes Level 2 radar, NOAA RadarUS+ offers access to 3 km hourly forecast radar and the following features:\n\n- 3 and 6 day precipitation and pressure forecasts from NOAA weather models\n- Temperature overlay\n- Snow/mixed precipitation display (only on 1km base reflectivity radar layer)\n- 7 day forecasts and current conditions -- just press and hold for a second on the radar map.\n- Severe weather (flash flood, tornado, and severe thunderstorm) warnings. Tap on a warning box to display the full warning message from the National Weather Service. Note: these are *not* push alerts. The app must be open to view the warnings.\n- Cloud cover and satellite imagery for the continental United States\n- Advanced radar layers (echo tops, composite reflectivity, and storm total precipitation).\n- Play, pause, and step animations\n- Fast zoom in and zoom out\n- Choice of radar palettes\n- Multiple map styles (terrain, map, satellite, and hybrid)\n- Displays time of radar image either as absolute time or relative to the current time\n- GPS locator that finds and displays your current location\n- Adjust the transparency (opacity) of the radar or cloud cover overlays\n- Radar clutter filtering and smoothing\n- Automatic refresh when new radar or cloud cover data is available\n- Search for a location by zip code, city name, or address\n- Legend for radar and cloud cover overlays\n- Saves and restores your last location and zoom level\n\nNote: Radar coverage only includes the continental United States. Alaska, Hawaii, and other US controlled territories are not included. \n\nSupport:\n\nPlease follow our Twitter stream at twitter.com/shuksansoft for breaking news and status updates."

Tidal information is essential for navigating a shallow waterway or placing your boat at anchor.  The success or failure of a voyage can depend on the height or depth of a tide, while knowledge of current information can save fuel and make passage into a river or channel safer. \n\nTides PRO goes further than the tables provided by the NOAA. The app automatically accounts for correction factors and provides instant information without requesting that you account for time lags, daylight savings conventions, or height differences between the reference stations and the locations you are seeking. \n\nSince the tidal information that is published in this app is not subjected to the use of the voyage, please do not use for navigation."

If you chase tornados, hail, or high winds for a living, or volunteer to assist your community during severe weather events, or just want to improve your situational awareness on days when storms might pop up, iDamage is the app for you.\n\nHere are its features: \n\n- Push notification of storm events, oftentimes including very specific damage reports. Coverage area includes the entire Contiguous (Lower 48) United States. \n\n- User-configurable filters allow you to receive notifications for the entire Contiguous US, an entire state, a local area, and/or for specific types of severe weather (tornado, hail, high wind). Use the auto-location feature of your mobile device to set a filter if you are traveling and not sure of your general location.\n\n- Filter push notifications by hail size\n\n- Optional alternate push alert sound for hail events\n\n- Map of storm events with color coded pins. Timeframes are 3-hr, full day, or archival (back to 29 Feb 2004). Touch any pin for access to details. iPod Touch or WiFi-only iPad users, data from your last view is cached for off-line use.\n\n- Filter Map View by event type and hail size\n\n- List of storm events in table form. Touch any cell in the table for a single pin street or hybrid map view. \n\n- Link to the \"Maps\" app on your home screen so you can get directions to the approximate location of severe weather events.\n\n- Storm reports may be e-mailed in an external email app.\n\n- 24 hour (with radar animation + watch boxes), 2-day, 3-day, and 4-8 day convective (thunderstorm) outlook with probability maps and technical discussion.\n\n- Mesoscale discussions with maps\n\n- Convective weather watches with maps.\n\n- Local hazardous weather products (including watches and warnings), selectable by touching a location on a map or via auto-location.\n\n*** NOTE: Watches and warnings are NOT pushed. iDamage only pushes reports of thunderstorm (convective) events.  Tropical and extratropical systems may not generate reports.\n\n- 9 pm - 9 am silence switch in Settings view. Push notifications will visually display, but alert tones are silenced.\n\n- iDamage has wildfire capability!

It is an instrument for measuring 'blueness', specifically the colour intensity of blue sky. With the measurement it is possible to draw conclusions from the constitution of the atmosphere: the bluer the sky the less the water vapor. Saussures cyanometer consisted out of 53 parts of a circular ring ranging from white over different grades of blue to black (Saussure used Prussian blue). Saussure used his cyanometer for measurements in Geneva, Chamonix und on the Mont Blanc.\nAlexander von Humboldt used a cyanometer on his expedition to America (1799 - 1804).\n\nYou can use our Cyanometer in three modes: The modern scale uses distinct grades of blue starting with clear white up to black. The Saussure scale shall give an idea about the colors from Saussures original cyanometer. With the user defined scale own scans of blue skies can be added to an own colored circular ring - an own cyanometer.\nEach scan is saved inside the app containing information about date, time and locality. So it is possible to compare scans of blue skies from different locations.\n\nPrivacy notice: No data will be saved or processed outside the app."

With Sol, you can check times and get reminders of solar events, at home or while traveling! Great for everyone looking to plan activities based on sunlight. Use it to remind you to walk the dog before dark, get up with the sun, or find golden hour time for that perfect photo.\n\nSol: Sun Clock is the Swiss-army knife of sunlight tools with a design inspired by the simplicity of the sundial. Use it to plan your day, guide natural sleep cycles, get the best light for outdoor photography, make sure animals or kids are safe inside before dark, or to map out the best times to go running or fishing. \n\n* Be in tune: Sol will tell you when the golden hour is, how much sunlight you have left in the day or what time the next sunrise occurs.\n\n* Look to the future, travel around the world: Sol lets you find sunlight information for any date, anywhere on earth. \n \n* Find solar midnight and solar noon, and all three twilight (dawn and dusk) periods: astronomical twilight, nautical twilight, and civil twilight. Keep tabs on the next solstice and equinox.\n \n* Reminders and Alarms: Use Sol as a natural alarm clock that you can set to any event (like sunset, golden hour or solar noon), and the alarm or reminder time will adjust gradually as the days change with the seasons.\n \n* Automatic Location: Sol not only calculates the amount of daylight and sunrise and sunset times, but does so for any location in the world (both Northern and Southern hemispheres) by using your device's GPS... no network connection required. \n\n* Other locations: Optionally, use the built-in map to choose any location in the world by moving the pin, or search using the name of any city.\n \n* Optional location-aware alarms. Sol knows when you change with your location; and as you travel it will adjust any alarms you set relative to sunrise and sunset times.  Create alarms for multiple locations around the world.\n\n* Detailed almanac information: Useful information about the day's length, sun's azimuth and elevation, equinoxes and solstices, and a friendly glossary that explains all the terms. \n\nNote: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. However, GPS runs in the background ONLY if you have set location-aware alarms."

      "label": "The venerable U.S. weather app Wx, named a Mac Gem by Macworld magazine, is now available for iPhone! Wx displays current conditions, forecasts, alerts, and radar for U.S. locations using high fidelity XML data from the U.S. National Weather Service. The app is designed for two specific types of customers: serious weather watchers who want detailed information and facts with no fuss, and casual users who want a fast, clean, and functional weather app that has low memory overhead and low CPU/battery usage. \n\nWx lets you choose your location on an embedded map, and uses that to setup custom forecasts based on the latitude and longitude of the location.  Forecasts include a 7-day summary \"point\" forecast, and a 7-day “pro” forecast that graphs temperature (actual and apparent), dew point, relative humidity, cloud cover, wind speed, wind direction, gust speed, 12-hour probability of precipitation, 6-hour liquid precipitation amount, and 6-hour snow amount.  These forecasts are about as good as it gets if you need to plan work, sports, hobbies, and outdoor activities based on upcoming weather.  With their high spatial resolution, the point and pro forecasts are especially useful in coastal and mountainous regions, where typical zone forecasts can be inaccurate.\n\nWx also lets you receive current conditions data from nearby NWS observation sites (over 1700 available in the U.S. and its territories), get radar data from nearby NEXRAD radar sites, and receive warnings from nearby city- and county-based alert zones.  \n\nWx lets you bookmark and setup weather maps for quick reference. Choose from some default NWS maps and images, or provide the URL for any map of your choice and load it right in the app! If you have preferred weather providers, you can load your favorite maps and images right in Wx and keep them handy. \n\nWx is crafted with attention to detail by a professional software developer with 29 years of experience, 15 years focused on developing weather software for OS X and 12 years writing apps for iOS devices. Wx has multiple levels of redundancy to handle severe weather events that can strain NWS servers, and even offers network settings for both Wi-Fi and cellular operation so that you can fine tune the app’s performance and bandwidth needs.\n\nWx is also available for the iPad and OS X. See hrtapps.com for more info.\n\n***NOTE***  If you need support or help, or have feedback, suggestions, or feature requests, please contact us via the support link (above) or on our website at hrtapps.com."

This app contains a database of more than 6000 forecast locations in Canada, the USA and Mexico and can check for new updates.  The launch screen monitors up to  four or five favourite observing locations.  Each square represents one hour and the colors vary from dark blue (excellent) to white (very poor) conditions for observing.  A red line indicates local midnight and there is a last updated timestamp.  Tapping on any preview chart will open a menu of options that allows you to (i) see a more detailed chart with legend, (ii) map the chart location, (iii) open the CSC web page, (iv) select a different chart location to monitor, (v) remove unwanted charts or (vi) share one of your charts via email, text message or social media.  Locations Services can help you find nearby CSC locations when you travel.\n\nRefer to Attilla Danko’s excellent CSC web site home page for complete details on interpreting the preview and detailed charts:\n\n    http://cleardarksky.com/csk  \n\nA complete PDF user manual is available on my website:\n\n    http://anythingbinary.com/iphone/myCSC/myCSC iOS User Guide.pdf\n\nThis app is no longer free.

Indicators makes it simple to read this wave energy data so you can determine the best swell windows (combinations of swell period and direction) for your favorite breaks. Buoys report data every 30 minutes, giving you a much better idea of how much swell is in the water rather than a subjective \"cam watching\" report.\n\n- 6 Hour History NOAA Buoy Data\nToo often, swell arrives later than predicted. Use the 6-hour history feature to determine if the swell has arrived. If not, go back to bed. \n\n- 7 Day Forecasted NOAA Buoy Data\nGraphically view forecasted buoy data, giving you a better idea of how the swell is changing with time.\n\n\nIndicators allows you to:\n\nSTOP WASTING TIME WATCHING SURF CAMS\nWaves come in sets... So if you are watching a cam...\nAre you sure you've watched long enough to see a good set? Are you sure you weren't fooled because you saw a rogue set? If you did see a good set... wouldn't you rather be riding it?\n\nSTOP READING REPORTS THAT ONLY UPDATE TWICE PER DAY\nWho makes these reports? Dudes watching cams... (flawed). How often are these updated? Twice per day... Really? Buoy data updates every 30 mintues... (I'd pick this one)\n\nKNOW WHEN THE SURF IS GOOD IN SECONDS\nYou only need buoy data... but not just any buoy data... You need swell height, direction and period for each swell. You can use this app to determine the optimal swell direction / period for your favorite breaks..."

      "label": "Weather forecasts and radar for weather nerds!\n\n*****\nFeatured by Apple, MacRumors, CNet, App Advice and more!  \"Weather Nerd is a comprehensive package in a gorgeous wrapper.\"\n*****\n\nWHAT'S NEW?\n\n - Optimized for All Sizes of Devices\n - Siri Support\n - Bolder, Larger Text\n - Tons of New Measurements Like Humidity, Pressure, etc\n - Forecasts for Your Calendar Events\n\nTOP FEATURES\n\n - Detailed daily reports (up to a year out)\n - Minute-to-minute precipitation (see coverage below)\n - Weather radar and satellite\n - 3 widgets (next hour, day, week)\n\nPurchase includes one year full access. After a year, you can renew via an in-app purchase. \n\n########################################\n\nCOVERAGE\n\nWeather reports are available for nearly anywhere in the world. If in doubt, go to http://darksky.net and try your location to see if you like the report.\n\nRadar is currently North America only.\n\nThe hour forecast is currently limited to US, UK, Ireland.\n\n\nDAILY COMPARISON\n\nWhen you're getting dressed, what do you want to know?\n\n\"How does today compare with yesterday?\"\n\nWeather Nerd includes a nice daily comparison:\n\n\"Today is 9° cooler than yesterday. No rain.\"\n\nThis makes it easy to grab the right coat.\n\n\nMINUTE-TO-MINUTE FORECAST\n\nWeather Nerd also gives you minute-by-minute rain predictions for your exact GPS location. Powered by Dark Sky's cutting edge \"hyperlocal precipitation forecasting system\", these reports show you a nice graph of the rain intensity for the next hour based on your exact location.  For example, you might see:\n\n\"Light rain starting in 10 minutes, stopping 15 minutes later.\"\n\n\nDAILY FORECAST\n\nThe daily forecast screen shows you a graph of the temperature, rain, and wind for today. Touch anywhere on the graph to view the forecast for a specific time. See more details at the bottom of the screen.\n\n\n\nWEEKLY FORECAST\n\nThe weekly forecast shows you a quick graph of the projected highs and lows for the next week, along with the chance of rain. Touch any day to view the full forecast for that day.\n\n\nBEYOND 7 DAYS\n\nNeed to see the forecast for two weeks or two months out? No problem. Weather Nerd's calendar lets you view the forecast for any date within the next year. \n\n\nNERD OUT\n\nFor the real weather nerds, the \"Nerd Out\" feature will list out ALL of the weather information.\n\n\nNERD ALERTS\n\nWeather Nerd lets you setup a daily weather forecast alert (in 15 minute intervals). You can turn the alert on/off for certain days of the week.\n\nIf you set your alert to 6pm or later, then the forecast will be for \"tomorrow's\" weather.\n\n\nNERD WIDGETS\n\nSome of you nerds like to use iPhone and iPad widgets. No problem. Weather Nerd comes packaged with 3 different widgets for your viewing pleasure including graphs for the \"Next Hour\", \"Today\", and \"Week\".\n\n\n========================\n\nWhy a subscription? The average nerd checks weather 4-5 times a day. Over a year, that alone cost nearly 1 USD to our providers. That's not counting additional data used for radar tiles, alerts, widgets, multiple devices, servers, etc. It would be completely unsustainable to charge a one time fee for a lifetime of data.\n\nWeather Nerd uses auto-renewing subscriptions. The Nerd Club subscription provides full access to weather reports, radar, widgets, and notifications. The subscription will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase within the app. Subscriptions will automatically renew at the end of your subscription period and will be charged through your iTunes account. Subscriptions renew automatically unless canceled at least 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. You can turn off auto-renewal at any time from your iTunes account settings. Cancellation of the current active subscription period is not allowed. \n\nTerms of Use: http://www.allstarapps.com/terms-of-service\nPrivacy Policy:  http://www.allstarapps.com/privacy-policy"

It also displays the current temperature and humidity.\n• Display barometric pressure (sensor value) or mean sea level pressure (MSLP - value used in weather forecast services or stations).\n• Units support for pressure: mb, inHg, kPa, atm, Torr, psi, hPa, mmHg. Units for altitude: meter, feet.\n• Calibrate the barometer using altitude/location from the GPS. Calibrate the altimeter using the nearest airport information/METAR, or manually enter the QNH of the nearest airport. Offset sensor output value.\n• Measure the height (building/mountain/hiked/climbed) using the \"Relative Altitude\" feature (can be enabled in the app's Settings).\n• Notification about pressure change. \"Notification custom rule\" for you to define how and when the app sends notifications.\nNotify when air pressure changes indicate that extreme or worse weather may occur.\n• \"Pressure Tracking\" and \"History Graph\" require \"Background App Refresh\" or \"Always Location Service\" with \"Exact update interval\" enabled.\n• \"My Area\" allows you to define your frequent stay places, and the app tracks air pressure with location data.\n• Export history to CSV format and Today widget.\n• This app is the digital version compared with an aneroid or mercury barometer and can be adjusted to MSLP with additional features.\n\nCUSTOMIZABLE:\nYou can change your barometer/altimeter appearance with:\n• Seven different housing colors.\n• Black, white or blue disk background.\n• Four different app backgrounds.\n• Three different types of needles.\n• Marker needle for easily monitor.\n• Dark or light Today widget theme.\n\nNOTES:\n• App only works on devices with a barometer sensor, such as iPhone 6/6s/7/8/X/11/12/13 (including Plus models), iPad Mini 4/Air 2/Pro, or later.\n• Weather icons on the dial: This only shows the air pressure trend like in an analog barometer.\n• Each time your device reboots, open the app for tracking with the \"Exact update interval\" feature work.\n• You may take the phone/tablet far away from computers, cables, and other magnetic sources to get accurate results.\n• This app is Pro / Premium version of the \"Barometer Plus - Altimeter\" app, only difference is all feature unlocked and no ads. If you already use the \"Barometer Plus - Altimeter\" app and purchased in-app, do not need to purchase this again.\n\nWe welcome your ideas and suggestions - please email us at: support+barometer@pvdapps.com.\nFollow our official Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/barometerplus/ or Twitter account: https://twitter.com/pvdapps."

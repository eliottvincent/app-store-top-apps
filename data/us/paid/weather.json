      "label": "RadarScope is a specialized display utility for weather enthusiasts and meteorologists that allows you view NEXRAD Level 3 and Level 2 radar data along with tornado, severe thunderstorm, flash flood, special marine and snow squall warnings, and predicted storm tracks issued by the U.S. National Weather Service. It can display the latest reflectivity, velocity, dual-polarization, and other products from any NEXRAD or TDWR radar site in the United States, Guam, Puerto Rico, Korea, and Okinawa, as well as data from Environment Canada, Australian Bureau of Meteorology, Finnish Meteorological Institute, and German Weather Service radars. These aren't smoothed images, this is native radar data rendered in its original radial format for a high level of detail. \n\nWhether you are scanning reflectivity for a mesocyclone's tell-tale hook echo, trying to pinpoint the landfall of a hurricane's eye wall, or looking for small features like velocity couplets in the storm relative radial velocity product, RadarScope gives you the power to view true radial weather radar data.\n\nRadarScope displays tornado, severe thunderstorm, flash flood, special marine, and snow squall warnings issued by the U.S. National Weather Service. You can browse the list of active warnings, select a warning to view the details, and even zoom to the selected warning on the map.\n\nPinch or stretch to zoom in and out. Drag your finger around the map to scroll. Tap the radar sweep button in the toolbar to switch radars. Select one of the 289 different radars in the United States, Canada, Australia, Germany, Korea, Puerto Rico, Guam, or Okinawa. Plot your current location by tapping the location button and optionally report it to the Spotter Network. Tap the play button to download and animate over recent images. Display the names of over 25,000 cities and towns on the map as you zoom and scroll. Tap and hold the color legend to see the data values. \n\nMeanwhile, RadarScope will retrieve and display updated data automatically and intelligently (approximately every 2 to 10 minutes, depending on the radar scan strategy). \n\nYou can display radar data from our servers, NOAA's public access web site, or your Allison House subscriber account. Spotter Network members can report their location and view the locations of other spotters.\n\nRadarScope Pro is an optional auto-renewing subscription with two different tiers to choose from.\n\nRadarScope Pro Tier One is an annual subscription that provides access to real-time animated lightning data and up to 30 frames of radar data, including extended loops of super-resolution data. Tier One subscribers can also access a data interrogation tool to quickly determine data values for specific radar pixels and an optional dual-pane mode for viewing two radar products side-by-side.\n\nRadarScope Pro Tier Two is an annual or monthly subscription that combines all the features in Tier One with more advanced features, including 50-frame loops, SPC outlooks, special weather statements, mesoscale discussions, local storm reports, hail size and probability contours, and azimuthal shear contours in the U.S., a 30-day archive of all radar products, a 2-year archive of NEXRAD Level 3 radar products, a full historical archive of NEXRAD Level 2 products, and the ability to use subscription features across multiple platforms.\n\nIf you choose to buy the RadarScope Pro subscription, it will charged to your iTunes account. The subscription will be auto-renewed within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period at the same price you originally paid. Subscriptions may be managed and auto-renewal disabled via your iTunes Account Settings after the purchase. Once purchased, the subscription cannot be cancelled during the active subscription period.\n\nDTN is committed to safeguarding your privacy online.

      "label": "Thanks to everyone for making MyRadar so successful, with over 50 million downloads!\n\nMyRadar Pro is IDENTICAL to the free version of MyRadar; it comes without the ads by default.\n\nMyRadar is a fast, powerful, easy-to-use weather app that displays animated weather radar around your current location and to quickly show what weather is coming your way. Just start the app; your location pops up with animated live radar, with radar loop lengths of up to two hours. This basic functionality provides the quickest way to get a snapshot of the weather on-the-go, and it's what has made MyRadar so successful over the years. Check your phone and get an instant assessment of the weather that will impact your day.\n\nIn addition to the live radar, MyRadar has an ever-increasing list of weather and environmentally-related data layers that you can overlay on top of the map;  our animated winds layer shows a breathtaking visual representation of both surface winds and winds at the jetstream level; the frontal boundaries layer shows high and low pressure systems as well as frontal boundaries themselves; the earthquakes layer is a great way to stay on top of the latest reports on seismic activity, completely customizable as to severity and time; our hurricane layer allows users to stay on top of the latest tropical storm and hurricane activity throughout the world; the aviation layer overlays AIRMETs, SIGMETs and other aviation-related data, including the ability to track flights and display their IFR flight plans and paths, and the \"wildfires\" layer allows users to stay abreast of the latest fire activity around the United States.\n\nMyRadar also has the ability to send weather and environmental alerts, including alerts from the National Weather Service, such as Tornado and Severe Weather alerts. A new feature introduced in this version of MyRadar includes the ability to receive alerts based off of Tropical  Storm and Hurricane activity;  you can configure the app to send you an alert any time a tropical storm or hurricane forms, or is upgraded or downgraded.\n\nOne of the most useful features in MyRadar is the ability to provide advanced rain alerts; our patent-pending process for predicting hyper-local rainfall is the most accurate in the industry. Instead of having to check the app all the time, MyRadar will send you an alert up to an hour in advance as to when the rain will arrive at your current location, down to the minute, including details on intensity and duration. These alerts can be a life saver when you're on-the-go and don't always have time to check the weather - our systems will proactively do the work for you and let you know in advance before the rain hits.\n\nIn addition to the free features of the app, additional upgrades are available, including real-time hurricane tracking - great for the start of hurricane season. The hurricane tracker provides additional data above and beyond the free version, including the cone of probability for tropical storm/hurricane forecast tracks, and it also includes a detailed synopsis from the National Hurricane Center. The premium upgrades also include the professional radar pack, which allows greater detail of radar from individual stations. Users can select individual radar stations around the US, select the radar tilt angle, and also change the radar product being displayed, including base reflectivity and wind velocity - great for experienced weather buffs looks to stay on top of possible tornado formation.\n\nDownload MyRadar today and try it out!\n* Aviation Charts subscription (not required in order to use MyRadar) ($24.99 USD per YEAR)\n* Payments will be charged to your iTunes account\n* Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period\n* Auto-renewal may be turned off at any time by going to your settings in the iTunes Store after purchase.\n\nMyRadar’s Privacy Policy, visit: https://myradar.com/privacy\nFull terms of service: https://myradar.com/terms"

      "label": "*** AeroWeather: for pilots, aviation enthusiasts, and everyone who is serious about the weather!\n*** Current and precise weather conditions (METAR) and forecasts (TAF).\n\nAeroWeather Pro provides quick and intuitive access to METAR and TAF for airports worldwide. Data can be shown in its original (raw) format or as fully decoded and easy understandable texts. AeroWeather Pro is helpful for weather preflight-briefings, but also to just get very precise weather. All weather data is cached for offline access. \n\nIn addition to weather data, AeroWeather Pro integrates also airport NOTAMs (provided by US FAA), webcam images around airports (provided by windy.com), FlightService access (US only), and US ATC delay information (provided by US FAA). AeroWeather Pro also offers built-in groups for earthquakes, nearby stations, and today widget (pre iOS14), which can be individually enabled on the top level view. Besides creating user groups it’s also possible to put stations on the same level user groups (e.g. home base). Depending on your needs, groups can be shown or hidden in the main list view. User groups can also be synchronized via Cloud Kit*. \n\nThe app features a built-in airport database, which includes airport data like runways, sunrise/sunset, twilight times, moon times, timezones etc. \n\nMETAR alert notifications** is another new and helpful feature to stay up-to-date. Define multiple alerts for each station with criteria like: flight rule (US NOAA), wind speed, temperature, pressure, present weather, visibility etc. Notifications will be sent to your device if the criteria is met (e.g., when flight rule becomes IFR).\n\nDedicated METAR/TAF** access is optionally available. METAR/TAF data will come primarily from a certified ANSP (air navigation service provider) and is provided reliably and fast from our dedicated, redundant servers (indicated by blue checkmark underneath METAR/TAF).\n\nThe AeroPix feature offers users the possibility to take quickly picture(s) of the weather at their current location. \n\nAeroWeather Pro comes with an Apple Watch app, which shows either a list of stations as defined in the Apple Watch group or all nearby stations based on the current location. METAR and TAF are displayed for each station. In addition, you can put AeroWeather as a complication in your watch face to stay up-to-date. \n\nAn iMessage app is also included which lets you easily send METAR/TAF of any airport to other users.\n\nPlease consult our web-site for a full description of all features. \n\n* Additional functionality which needs to be unlocked (one-time purchase). These purchases are not transferable between Lite, Pro, and Mac.\n\n** SUBSCRIPTIONS\nAdditional features which generate recurring operation costs for us will be offered within a subscription. The following features are enabled while 'First' subscription is active:\n - Dedicated METAR/TAF data source\n - Meteograms\n - Alert push notifications\n - D-ATIS (bigger US airports only)\n - Area Forecast Discussions (currently US only)\n - Home Screen Widgets for METAR, Plot, Meteogram (iOS 14 or higher)\n - Imagery and Charts (requires 'Captain' subscription)\n - SIGMETs (requires 'Captain' subscription)\n\nAdditional features are also enabled when using AeroWeather Lite.\n\nThe subscription varies in time periods (1 month, 12 months). The subscription is valid in both AeroWeather Lite and Pro. Cross app subscription support is only available if iCloud (with the same Apple ID) is enabled. Previously purchased unlock features are not affected and will work with or without subscription.\n\nAuto-renewal may be turned off at any time by going to your account settings. A payment will be charged to your iTunes account at the end of the free trial period. Your iTunes account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. No commitment - you can cancel any time.\n\nPleas read the full “Subscription Terms of Use” at:\nhttps://www.lakehorn.com/subscription-terms-of-use/"

      "label": "Earthquake Network is the most comprehensive app on earthquakes and for most world countries it is the only earthquake early warning system for receiving real time alerts.\n\nEarthquake Network gives you:\n\n- Real time alerts if you live close to the epicentre\n- Alerts seconds in advances if you live far from the epicentre\n- Real time user reports on felt earthquakes\n- Free earthquake data from 21 seismic networks including U.S., Puerto Rico, India, Indonesia, Turkey, Mexico, Chile, Peru, Ecuador, Argentina, Venezuela, Dominican Republic, Colombia, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, China, New Zeland, Japan, Italy, Croatia, Spain and Greece\n\nThe Earthquake Network research project (https://www.sismo.app) aims at developing a smartphone-based earthquake early warning system able to detect earthquakes in real time and to alert the population in advance. Smartphones are able to detect earthquakes thanks to the accelerometer on-board each device. When an earthquake is detected, users with the application installed are immediatly alerted. Since earthquake waves travel at around 5 km/s it is possible to alert the population not yet reached by the damaging waves of the earthquake. For the scientific details about the project please refer to the scientific paper on Frontiers at https://bit.ly/2C8B5HI\n\nSubscriptions:\n\nWhen an earthquake is detected in real time by smartphones near the epicenter, the server sends an alert to all users with the app. Alerting all users can take up to 10 seconds since it is not technically feasible to do so instantly. Now you can join the priority lists of the first 10,000 or 100,000 people alerted in real time. The following subscriptions are available:\n\n- Subscription 10k for 1 year\n- Subscription 10k for 1 month \n\n- Subscription 100k for 1 year\n- Subscription 100k for 1 month \n\n• Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\n• Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n• Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal\n• Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase\n• Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n\nPrivacy: https://www.sismo.app/privacy\n\nTerms and conditions: https://www.sismo.app/terms-conditions"

You've probably heard that the best times to fish are at dawn and dusk, but there's more to it than that. This app can help you consistently catch your limit by giving you the exact times to hit the water!  Click \"...More\" to learn why you should download this App today!\n\n*****  Featured in \"New and Newsworthy\" and \"What's Hot\"  *****\n\n*****\n\"All I can say is I took my two boys out during the time it said.... 2 catfish, 2 brim, 1 small mouth bass. We are not fisherman just a dad and 2 boys\"\n-- David\n\nPlanning a fishing trip? Don't head down to the water before you put Best Fishing Times in your virtual tackle box. Whether you're new to fishing or a seasoned angler, this app helps ensure your success no matter where on Earth you fish. \n\nBest Fishing Times Features Include:\n* Choose a location by Manual Entry, Auto GPS or Select from Map \n* Major & Minor Feeding and Activity Periods \n* Day ratings \n* Activity Index for the day rating \n* Moon rise, Moon set and Moon Transit times \n* Moon Phase Data \n* Sunrise, Sunset and Sun Transit times \n* Day / Weekly view \n* Weather conditions and forecasts (USA)\n* Date selection for checking Solunar data in advance \n* Any Date or Location \n* Check time zone settings \n* Graphical sun and moon simulator \n* Compass \n* Wind forecast for fly fishing (data available for the USA only)\nYou've probably heard the phrase \"Timing is everything\", and those words are especially true for fishing. It's not enough to know where the fish are. If you want to catch them, you have to know when they're going to be biting. \n\nEveryone knows there are certain times of the day or night that fish are more active; and until now, most people have relied on pure luck to get their line in the water during those times. Of course there have always been dedicated anglers who don't believe in luck. They spend hours before a fishing trip checking weather conditions, studying moon phase charts and performing complicated conversions for sun and moon positions, geographical location, time zone changes and other variables. Sound like a lot of work? It doesn't have to be.\n\nNo matter which of these two groups you fall into, Best Fishing Times was designed for you! This app takes luck out of the equation, and eliminates the need for math and charts. Just pick your fishing location and the date you want to fish, and get all the information you could ever want before you even leave home. Whether you're planning for next week or next year, Best Fishing Times will get you to the water at the right time of day to catch your limit.\n\nWith a few taps of your finger, you'll see the best day of any week to go fishing, and the times of day the fish will be most active. If you prefer to check the data yourself, Best Fishing Times puts all of the information right at your fingertips, including moon phase, moon rise and moon set, major and minor activity periods for any day, and even includes a graphical sun and moon simulator!\n\nYou wouldn't go to the ball park without knowing whether or not there's a game scheduled, so why would you go fishing without knowing when the fish are biting? Download Best Fishing Times now and stop casting blindly. You'll spend less time fishing and more time catching."

Best hunting times are calculated based on the information about the Moon and the Sun for your specific location.

Tap on the buttons on the top to show sunrise and sunset times, day length or moonrise and moonset.

Indicators makes it simple to read this wave energy data so you can determine the best swell windows (combinations of swell period and direction) for your favorite breaks. Buoys report data every 30 minutes, giving you a much better idea of how much swell is in the water rather than a subjective \"cam watching\" report.\n\n- 6 Hour History NOAA Buoy Data\nToo often, swell arrives later than predicted. Use the 6-hour history feature to determine if the swell has arrived. If not, go back to bed. \n\n- 7 Day Forecasted NOAA Buoy Data\nGraphically view forecasted buoy data, giving you a better idea of how the swell is changing with time.\n\n\nIndicators allows you to:\n\nSTOP WASTING TIME WATCHING SURF CAMS\nWaves come in sets... So if you are watching a cam...\nAre you sure you've watched long enough to see a good set? Are you sure you weren't fooled because you saw a rogue set? If you did see a good set... wouldn't you rather be riding it?\n\nSTOP READING REPORTS THAT ONLY UPDATE TWICE PER DAY\nWho makes these reports? Dudes watching cams... (flawed). How often are these updated? Twice per day... Really? Buoy data updates every 30 mintues... (I'd pick this one)\n\nKNOW WHEN THE SURF IS GOOD IN SECONDS\nYou only need buoy data... but not just any buoy data... You need swell height, direction and period for each swell. You can use this app to determine the optimal swell direction / period for your favorite breaks..."

The oldest device I can live in is one with iOS 10.3.4, like an iPhone 5. Just leave the device charging, set up your settings & press the blue thunder.\n\nI will handle the rest. Happy to help!\n\n\nIT’S FOR THE ONE WHO :: \n• Has delicate electrical equipment that power failures might destroy them\n• Has his/her equipment destroyed from power failures (e.g. fridges)\n• Needs to be notified when power has failed\n• Needs to know the duration of power failures\n• Thinks safety is above all\n\nWHY IS USEFUL ::\n• Will wake you up when sleeping\n• Will send you an email when power has failed\n• Will send you an email when power has been restored\n• Handy in areas with tornados or earthquakes (usually power fails before the tornado).\n\nHOW IT WORKS?\nJust insert the charging cable and press play or thunder (electrical power symbol). The moment the power fails it gives you an audible & visual alarm. You will definitely be awake even if your sleep is deep. Press \"TEST\" and see for yourself. Will also send you Telegram & email notifications, just set them up correctly first.\n\nAnd when the power is off, the flashlight is there in the same screen for your convenience, in order to navigate in the dark.\n\nIDEAL OPERATION SCENARIO ::\n• Find a device no longer in use (see list below for minimum)\n• Find a working charging cable*\n• Place it on your place with the delicate equipment (fridges, incubator, dehumidifier, etc)\n• Connect it to WiFi and 3/4G\n• Adjust the Detection Sensitivity if I want to avoid micro failures (less than 3 seconds)\n• Enable & Setup Telegram\n• Enter your email\n• Turn off sound alarm\n• Start monitoring power failures\n• In case of power failure it will send you a Telegram message or email\n• You can then take action as planned for power failures.\n\nDEVICES SUPPORTED ::\n• Any iOS device with iOS 10.3 or Newer\n• iPhone 5 (updated to last iOS) (2012) or Newer\n• iPod Touch 6th Generation (2015) & Newer\n• iPad 4th Generation (2014) & Newer\n• iPad Mini 2 (2014) & Newer\n\nCheck FAQ at App Support Webpage (Information Below)\n\n\n* be aware that the device is in good working condition (ideally hold power & home buttons until you see Apple logo before operation)\n* be sure to use original battery, charging cable & charger to prevent any malfunction if charging for long periods of time.\n\n_________________\n\nIn case you need this app in your language, please contact support."

      "label": "Weather forecasts and radar for weather nerds!\n\n*****\nFeatured by Apple, MacRumors, CNet, App Advice and more!  \"Weather Nerd is a comprehensive package in a gorgeous wrapper.\"\n*****\n\nWHAT'S NEW?\n\n - Optimized for All Sizes of Devices\n - Siri Support\n - Bolder, Larger Text\n - Tons of New Measurements Like Humidity, Pressure, etc\n - Forecasts for Your Calendar Events\n\nTOP FEATURES\n\n - Detailed daily reports (up to a year out)\n - Minute-to-minute precipitation (see coverage below)\n - Weather radar and satellite\n - 3 widgets (next hour, day, week)\n\nPurchase includes one year full access. After a year, you can renew via an in-app purchase. \n\n########################################\n\nCOVERAGE\n\nWeather reports are available for nearly anywhere in the world. If in doubt, go to http://darksky.net and try your location to see if you like the report.\n\nRadar is currently North America only.\n\nThe hour forecast is currently limited to US, UK, Ireland.\n\n\nDAILY COMPARISON\n\nWhen you're getting dressed, what do you want to know?\n\n\"How does today compare with yesterday?\"\n\nWeather Nerd includes a nice daily comparison:\n\n\"Today is 9° cooler than yesterday. No rain.\"\n\nThis makes it easy to grab the right coat.\n\n\nMINUTE-TO-MINUTE FORECAST\n\nWeather Nerd also gives you minute-by-minute rain predictions for your exact GPS location. Powered by Dark Sky's cutting edge \"hyperlocal precipitation forecasting system\", these reports show you a nice graph of the rain intensity for the next hour based on your exact location.  For example, you might see:\n\n\"Light rain starting in 10 minutes, stopping 15 minutes later.\"\n\n\nDAILY FORECAST\n\nThe daily forecast screen shows you a graph of the temperature, rain, and wind for today. Touch anywhere on the graph to view the forecast for a specific time. See more details at the bottom of the screen.\n\n\n\nWEEKLY FORECAST\n\nThe weekly forecast shows you a quick graph of the projected highs and lows for the next week, along with the chance of rain. Touch any day to view the full forecast for that day.\n\n\nBEYOND 7 DAYS\n\nNeed to see the forecast for two weeks or two months out? No problem. Weather Nerd's calendar lets you view the forecast for any date within the next year. \n\n\nNERD OUT\n\nFor the real weather nerds, the \"Nerd Out\" feature will list out ALL of the weather information.\n\n\nNERD ALERTS\n\nWeather Nerd lets you setup a daily weather forecast alert (in 15 minute intervals). You can turn the alert on/off for certain days of the week.\n\nIf you set your alert to 6pm or later, then the forecast will be for \"tomorrow's\" weather.\n\n\nNERD WIDGETS\n\nSome of you nerds like to use iPhone and iPad widgets. No problem. Weather Nerd comes packaged with 3 different widgets for your viewing pleasure including graphs for the \"Next Hour\", \"Today\", and \"Week\".\n\n\n========================\n\nWhy a subscription? The average nerd checks weather 4-5 times a day. Over a year, that alone cost nearly 1 USD to our providers. That's not counting additional data used for radar tiles, alerts, widgets, multiple devices, servers, etc. It would be completely unsustainable to charge a one time fee for a lifetime of data.\n\nWeather Nerd uses auto-renewing subscriptions. The Nerd Club subscription provides full access to weather reports, radar, widgets, and notifications. The subscription will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase within the app. Subscriptions will automatically renew at the end of your subscription period and will be charged through your iTunes account. Subscriptions renew automatically unless canceled at least 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. You can turn off auto-renewal at any time from your iTunes account settings. Cancellation of the current active subscription period is not allowed. \n\nTerms of Use: http://www.allstarapps.com/terms-of-service\nPrivacy Policy:  http://www.allstarapps.com/privacy-policy"

Why not try Xasteria - it is completely free with no ads - if you like it, you can support the service by getting Xasteria+ which comes with many extra features:\n\n-Dark Sky configurable hourly/hyperlocal world forecast.\n-Night-vision mode (choice of red/green/blue) with dimmer.\n-Lunar Calendar with Sun/Moon graphs and rise/set/twilight.\n-Location Manager with choice of location sources (online search, offline database, maps) and access to GPS accuracy/elevation and barometer data (for iPhones/iPads with barometer sensor).\n-Landscape display mode ability extends to iPhone/iPod.\n\nAs with Xasteria, you get a customizable world forecast from the ASTRO/7Timer service which provides:\n-Cloud cover.\n-Astronomical seeing.\n-Atmospheric transparency.\n-Temperature & Humidity.\n-Rain/Snow.\n-Atmospheric instability.\n-Wind Speed & Direction.\nThe Dark Sky forecast adds visibility & dew point.\n\nXasteria provides you with a choice of 3 visualization modes for the data: the new 7Timer! ASTRO graphics, the color-stripe graphics similar to some other astro-forecast services and a raw text mode.\n\nAdditional features:\n-Quick access to selected astro-weather web sources like Clear Outside, Meteoblue, Windy, Astrospheric, Sat24.com, the latest water vapor satellite images and animations, as well as the nearest Clear Sky Charts.\n-Light pollution report/maps for your location.\n-ISS and bright satellite passes for your location (data from heavens-above.com). \n\nXasteria is available in English, Greek and French. If you would like to translate it to your own language, please contact the author.\n\nI would appreciate a quick review on the App Store if you are using the app (there will be no popup asking you in the app as I hate those).

Tidal information is essential for navigating a shallow waterway or placing your boat at anchor.  The success or failure of a voyage can depend on the height or depth of a tide, while knowledge of current information can save fuel and make passage into a river or channel safer. \n\nTides PRO goes further than the tables provided by the NOAA. The app automatically accounts for correction factors and provides instant information without requesting that you account for time lags, daylight savings conventions, or height differences between the reference stations and the locations you are seeking. \n\nSince the tidal information that is published in this app is not subjected to the use of the voyage, please do not use for navigation."

      "label": "The venerable U.S. weather app Wx, named a Mac Gem by Macworld magazine, is now available for iPhone! Wx displays current conditions, forecasts, alerts, and radar for U.S. locations using high fidelity XML data from the U.S. National Weather Service. The app is designed for two specific types of customers: serious weather watchers who want detailed information and facts with no fuss, and casual users who want a fast, clean, and functional weather app that has low memory overhead and low CPU/battery usage. \n\nWx lets you choose your location on an embedded map, and uses that to setup custom forecasts based on the latitude and longitude of the location.  Forecasts include a 7-day summary \"point\" forecast, and a 7-day “pro” forecast that graphs temperature (actual and apparent), dew point, relative humidity, cloud cover, wind speed, wind direction, gust speed, 12-hour probability of precipitation, 6-hour liquid precipitation amount, and 6-hour snow amount.  These forecasts are about as good as it gets if you need to plan work, sports, hobbies, and outdoor activities based on upcoming weather.  With their high spatial resolution, the point and pro forecasts are especially useful in coastal and mountainous regions, where typical zone forecasts can be inaccurate.\n\nWx also lets you receive current conditions data from nearby NWS observation sites (over 1700 available in the U.S. and its territories), get radar data from nearby NEXRAD radar sites, and receive warnings from nearby city- and county-based alert zones.  \n\nWx lets you bookmark and setup weather maps for quick reference. Choose from some default NWS maps and images, or provide the URL for any map of your choice and load it right in the app! If you have preferred weather providers, you can load your favorite maps and images right in Wx and keep them handy. \n\nWx is crafted with attention to detail by a professional software developer with 29 years of experience, 15 years focused on developing weather software for OS X and 12 years writing apps for iOS devices. Wx has multiple levels of redundancy to handle severe weather events that can strain NWS servers, and even offers network settings for both Wi-Fi and cellular operation so that you can fine tune the app’s performance and bandwidth needs.\n\nWx is also available for the iPad and OS X. See hrtapps.com for more info.\n\n***NOTE***  If you need support or help, or have feedback, suggestions, or feature requests, please contact us via the support link (above) or on our website at hrtapps.com."

Make sure to use the advanced settings, they are there to maximize performance in your area.\n \n--- SERVICE AREA ---\nView the RainAware service coverage map before purchasing: https://www.rainaware.com/rainaware_coverage_map.gif\n\n--- NOTES ---\nRainAware is ONLY for use in the continental United States. RainAware relies on National Weather Service radars and may not work properly if a radar is down or if the beam is blocked by mountains. Extremely light sprinkles or drizzle may not always be detected. Precipitation times will change as RainAware adjusts to rapidly changing weather conditions. Precipitation can form suddenly or dissipate at any time. Works best when precipitation is moving. Times are estimates and have inherent error. Advanced settings are there to mitigate these issues."

There is now a Setting View to select which time to display in complications. Swipe left to change this Setting. As space inside different complications allows, some complications have both rise and set times and even a sun arc for daylight! Small complications allow a single user-selected time, like \"C up arrow\" for next Civil Sun Rise.\n\nThis App is for Apple Watch Series 3 and later!"

      "label": "Weather Calculations is the only weather calculator you will need.  It contains 6 calculators in one: Heat Index, Wind Chill, Dew Point, Apparent Temperature, Humidex, and Wet Bulb Globe Temperature.\n\nThis calculator handles both imperial and metric units (with built-in unit converter).  Enter the air temperature in Fahrenheit or Celsius.  Enter the wind speed in miles per hour, meters per second, kilometers per hour, or knots.  Many more units included!\n\nCompare various models to see which matches how you perceive the weather.  Explore what-if scenarios to better understand weather modeling.\n\n\n**Heat Index Calculator**\nHeat Index calculates the Heat Index from models by the US National Weather Service.\n\nNotes: Heat Index is defined for temperatures above 80 degrees F (27 degrees C) and relative humidity above 40%.  Calculator may not be accurate outside those ranges.\n\n\n**Wind Chill Calculator**\nWind Chill calculate the wind chill using both the new (post-2001) and old (pre-2001) Windchill Temperature (WCT) index from models by the US National Weather Service.  It also provides the old Windchill Index in kcal/m^2/h.\n\nNotes: Windchill Temperature is defined for temperatures below 50 degrees F (10 degrees C) and wind speeds above 3 mph (4.8 kph or 1.34 m/s).  Calculator may not be accurate outside those ranges.\n\n\n**Dew Point Calculator**\nUnlike some calculators which only calculate the dew point temperature, the Dew Point Calculator will also calculate the air temperature given the dew point temperature and relative humidity as well as calculate the relative humidity given the air temperature and the dew point temperature.\n\nThis calculator uses the more accurate August-Roche-Magnus model and is accurate for temperatures between 32°F (0°C) and 140°F (60°C).\n\n\n**Humidex Calculator**\nHumidex is a quick heat index calculator.  Want to know the effect of humidity on how hot it feels?\n\nHumidex calculates the humidex from models by the Meteorological Service of Canada.\n\n**Apparent Temperature Calculator**\nApparent Temperature uses the three factor model developed by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, which assumes a sunny day.\n\nThis advanced model works for high and low temperatures, combining the effects of humidity and wind chill into a single 'feels like' apparent temperature.\n\n\n**Wet Bulb Globe Temperature Calculator**\nWet Bulb Globe Temperature is an estimate of how hot it feels with humidity?\n\nEnter the temperature and relative humidity, and Wet Bulb Globe Temperature calculates the WBGTI describing how temperature and humidity feels.  Flag indicators help you to quickly identify the risks of outdoor activities.  These indicators are based on the system used by the USMC (see: http://www.mcrdpi.usmc.mil/weather.asp for more details).\n\nThis WBGT index calculator uses the same approximation as the Australian Bureau of Meteorology for estimating the Wet Bulb Globe Temperature from the air temperature and relative humidity, assuming sunny day and light wind.  On cloudy or windy days, this is an overestimation of how hot it feels."

      "label": "One of the easiest ways to become a happier person is to experience more sunlight every day. Skylight can help make that happen through a beautiful app experience designed for everyone.\n\nCreate a routine around sunrise every morning. Remind yourself to step out at solar noon for a sun break. Take better photos by shooting during Golden Hour. Start getting outside to see the sunset more. Gain a better sense of sunlight lost and gained through the seasons and adjust your routine to make sure you get enough light. Motivate yourself through the winter months by reminding yourself that days are getting longer. The uses are endless but the goal is the same - better living through more sunlight.\n\nSkylight includes a universal app for iPad and iPhone, an Apple Watch app with complications, and three widgets. The Apple Watch complications show you how much sunlight is left in the day, or when upcoming events like Golden Hour are taking place. The complications are a beautiful addition to the watch face and offer one of the most effective ways to use the app. The Today Widget shows you the app information in a quick, glanceable form, so daylight info is always at your fingertips, either in your Today view or with a 3D Touch on the app icon.\n\nFeatures include:\n- Beautiful fluid visual display showing the position of the sun over time.\n- Comprehensive notifications & alarms for daily and yearly sun events.\n- Three different configurable widgets: Year Graph, Daylight Graph, and Gradient.\n- Apple Watch app and complications with daylight clock and events.\n- Year view, showing the entire year's daily sun events with a simple drag of your finger.\n- Detailed event views, describing each sun event and showing the earliest and latest. dates on which it occurs.\n- Date picker to see sun information from dates in the past or future.\n- Location picker to see sun events and graphs for anywhere on earth.\n- Multiple time modes, including specialized modes for photography and science.\n- Support for all display sizes and device orientations.\n- Spotlight support, so you can just type \"Golden Hour\" from your phone's home screen to pull up today's info.\n- Skylight can optionally use GPS in the background to ensure notifications are correct even if you change location.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nSkylight is an indie app developed by the creators of Magic Window. We strive to make beautiful software that connects people with the world. If you have any issues or questions please contact us at support@jetsoncreative.com."

With Sol, you can check times and get reminders of solar events, at home or while traveling! Great for everyone looking to plan activities based on sunlight. Use it to remind you to walk the dog before dark, get up with the sun, or find golden hour time for that perfect photo.\n\nSol: Sun Clock is the Swiss-army knife of sunlight tools with a design inspired by the simplicity of the sundial. Use it to plan your day, guide natural sleep cycles, get the best light for outdoor photography, make sure animals or kids are safe inside before dark, or to map out the best times to go running or fishing. \n\n* Be in tune: Sol will tell you when the golden hour is, how much sunlight you have left in the day or what time the next sunrise occurs.\n\n* Look to the future, travel around the world: Sol lets you find sunlight information for any date, anywhere on earth. \n \n* Find solar midnight and solar noon, and all three twilight (dawn and dusk) periods: astronomical twilight, nautical twilight, and civil twilight. Keep tabs on the next solstice and equinox.\n \n* Reminders and Alarms: Use Sol as a natural alarm clock that you can set to any event (like sunset, golden hour or solar noon), and the alarm or reminder time will adjust gradually as the days change with the seasons.\n \n* Automatic Location: Sol not only calculates the amount of daylight and sunrise and sunset times, but does so for any location in the world (both Northern and Southern hemispheres) by using your device's GPS... no network connection required. \n\n* Other locations: Optionally, use the built-in map to choose any location in the world by moving the pin, or search using the name of any city.\n \n* Optional location-aware alarms. Sol knows when you change with your location; and as you travel it will adjust any alarms you set relative to sunrise and sunset times.  Create alarms for multiple locations around the world.\n\n* Detailed almanac information: Useful information about the day's length, sun's azimuth and elevation, equinoxes and solstices, and a friendly glossary that explains all the terms. \n\nNote: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. However, GPS runs in the background ONLY if you have set location-aware alarms."

This app lets you determine what levels of radiation are being reported at various locations around the world. You can scroll around the map and zoom in on readings. Readings are continuously updated every few minutes. \n\nIt displays the current ionizing radiation reading from these detectors on an easy to use world map, in uR/hr, one of the standard units of measurement for radiation. You can scroll around and zoom in to your area. Typical background (naturally occurring) radiation values near sea level are in the 10 to 20 uR/hr range. Higher readings naturally occur at higher elevations due to cosmic rays from outer space.\n\nTapping on one of the readings will bring up a chart of the last few days worth of readings. You can even smooth out the variations by adjusting the number of samples averaged per plotted point, to bring out subtle variations. \n\nBuy a copy of Radiation Map Tracker, and you'll never be in the dark about nuclear radiation levels again."

      "label": "This app includes the same functionality as our free Marine Barometer app available in the App Store, with several valuable features added.  You can review the basic features of the design by installing and becoming familiar with the free Marine Barometer app.  \n\nThe new features in this Marine Barograph app include: automatic storage of atmospheric pressure, with time and date, GPS position, course over ground (COG) and speed over ground (SOG). The pressure data can be graphed (pressure versus time) over several time intervals from 30 min on up to 16 days. The graphs can be pinch zoomed for more detail or double tapped to expand both scales. Use Reset View button to undo changes.  Tap the graph at any point to read time and pressure at that point. \n\nLarge digital displays can be viewed from a distance, including prominent pressure trend arrows (visible when data one hour old is available). On the three-hour display, the official pressure tendency is computed and displayed, and the shape of the curve in view can be used to determine the pressure tendency characteristic code used in official ship reports. Also new are options for pressure display (sea level or station), precision, and latitude and longitude formats.\n\nThe stored data can be viewed from within the app or exported and shared according to time range of the storage files. The stored data are effectively a log of the voyage with navigation information as well as the pressure data. Besides the pressure data, your track of GPS positions can also be exported to view in a navigation program or Google Earth. \n\nThis app can be used to convert a second or older iPhone (iPhone 6 or newer) not otherwise in use into a valuable stand-alone electronic barograph and voyage data logger. Just load the app and plug it in for continual viewing.\n\nThe full help file with details of operation and tips on the use of atmospheric pressure in navigation is included in the app. This file can be viewed online at https://www.starpath.com/marinebarograph along with videos showing how to use the app."

      "label": "* Featured by Apple in ‘What’s Hot’ in the United States under iPad > Weather\n\nThe Wind Chill Index Factor displays automatic weather calculation based on iPhone/iPad localization features with available internet access. Just press the Fetch button.\n\nThis is a tool for measuring the perceived when outside by measuring the impact of wind on the temperature of the air. The wind chill factor can not lower a temperature below the current air temperature, but instead it speeds up the decrease in temperature proportional the speed of the wind\n\nBoth the Old model for calculating the Wind Chill Factor, pre-2001 formula, and the New Wind Chill Index devised by the National Weather Service in 2001 are used. The values are calculated to the second decimal place for extra accuracy.\n\nInputs for Air Temperature can be given as Fahrenheit or Celsius. Acceptable inputs for wind velocity are Knots, Miles per Hour, and Kilometers per Hour. \n\nThis app features: \n\n• Send your calculations or conversions by email \n• Universal App (iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad)\n• All iPhone and iPad screen sizes are supported\n• Retina Display graphics \n• Fast app switching \n• Automatically Saves Your Inputs \n• Latest version of iOS is supported\n\nNo network connectivity required.\n\nNote: Windchill Temperature is only defined for temperatures at or below 50 degrees F and wind speeds above 3 mph."

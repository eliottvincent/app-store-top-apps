      "label": "RadarScope is a specialized display utility for weather enthusiasts and meteorologists that allows you view NEXRAD Level 3 and Level 2 radar data along with tornado, severe thunderstorm, flash flood, special marine and snow squall warnings, and predicted storm tracks issued by the U.S. National Weather Service. It can display the latest reflectivity, velocity, dual-polarization, and other products from any NEXRAD or TDWR radar site in the United States, Guam, Puerto Rico, Korea, and Okinawa, as well as data from Environment Canada, Australian Bureau of Meteorology, Finnish Meteorological Institute, and German Weather Service radars. These aren't smoothed images, this is native radar data rendered in its original radial format for a high level of detail. \n\nWhether you are scanning reflectivity for a mesocyclone's tell-tale hook echo, trying to pinpoint the landfall of a hurricane's eye wall, or looking for small features like velocity couplets in the storm relative radial velocity product, RadarScope gives you the power to view true radial weather radar data.\n\nRadarScope displays tornado, severe thunderstorm, flash flood, special marine, and snow squall warnings issued by the U.S. National Weather Service. You can browse the list of active warnings, select a warning to view the details, and even zoom to the selected warning on the map.\n\nPinch or stretch to zoom in and out. Drag your finger around the map to scroll. Tap the radar sweep button in the toolbar to switch radars. Select one of the 289 different radars in the United States, Canada, Australia, Germany, Korea, Puerto Rico, Guam, or Okinawa. Plot your current location by tapping the location button and optionally report it to the Spotter Network. Tap the play button to download and animate over recent images. Display the names of over 25,000 cities and towns on the map as you zoom and scroll. Tap and hold the color legend to see the data values. \n\nMeanwhile, RadarScope will retrieve and display updated data automatically and intelligently (approximately every 2 to 10 minutes, depending on the radar scan strategy). \n\nYou can display radar data from our servers, NOAA's public access web site, or your Allison House subscriber account. Spotter Network members can report their location and view the locations of other spotters.\n\nRadarScope Pro is an optional auto-renewing subscription with two different tiers to choose from.\n\nRadarScope Pro Tier One is an annual subscription that provides access to real-time animated lightning data and up to 30 frames of radar data, including extended loops of super-resolution data. Tier One subscribers can also access a data interrogation tool to quickly determine data values for specific radar pixels and an optional dual-pane mode for viewing two radar products side-by-side.\n\nRadarScope Pro Tier Two is an annual or monthly subscription that combines all the features in Tier One with more advanced features, including 50-frame loops, SPC outlooks, special weather statements, mesoscale discussions, local storm reports, hail size and probability contours, and azimuthal shear contours in the U.S., a 30-day archive of all radar products, a 2-year archive of NEXRAD Level 3 radar products, a full historical archive of NEXRAD Level 2 products, and the ability to use subscription features across multiple platforms.\n\nIf you choose to buy the RadarScope Pro subscription, it will charged to your iTunes account. The subscription will be auto-renewed within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period at the same price you originally paid. Subscriptions may be managed and auto-renewal disabled via your iTunes Account Settings after the purchase. Once purchased, the subscription cannot be cancelled during the active subscription period.\n\nDTN is committed to safeguarding your privacy online.

      "label": "Thanks to everyone for making MyRadar so successful, with over 50 million downloads!\n\nMyRadar Pro is IDENTICAL to the free version of MyRadar; it comes without the ads by default.\n\nMyRadar is a fast, powerful, easy-to-use weather app that displays animated weather radar around your current location and to quickly show what weather is coming your way. Just start the app; your location pops up with animated live radar, with radar loop lengths of up to two hours. This basic functionality provides the quickest way to get a snapshot of the weather on-the-go, and it's what has made MyRadar so successful over the years. Check your phone and get an instant assessment of the weather that will impact your day.\n\nIn addition to the live radar, MyRadar has an ever-increasing list of weather and environmentally-related data layers that you can overlay on top of the map;  our animated winds layer shows a breathtaking visual representation of both surface winds and winds at the jetstream level; the frontal boundaries layer shows high and low pressure systems as well as frontal boundaries themselves; the earthquakes layer is a great way to stay on top of the latest reports on seismic activity, completely customizable as to severity and time; our hurricane layer allows users to stay on top of the latest tropical storm and hurricane activity throughout the world; the aviation layer overlays AIRMETs, SIGMETs and other aviation-related data, including the ability to track flights and display their IFR flight plans and paths, and the \"wildfires\" layer allows users to stay abreast of the latest fire activity around the United States.\n\nMyRadar also has the ability to send weather and environmental alerts, including alerts from the National Weather Service, such as Tornado and Severe Weather alerts. A new feature introduced in this version of MyRadar includes the ability to receive alerts based off of Tropical  Storm and Hurricane activity;  you can configure the app to send you an alert any time a tropical storm or hurricane forms, or is upgraded or downgraded.\n\nOne of the most useful features in MyRadar is the ability to provide advanced rain alerts; our patent-pending process for predicting hyper-local rainfall is the most accurate in the industry. Instead of having to check the app all the time, MyRadar will send you an alert up to an hour in advance as to when the rain will arrive at your current location, down to the minute, including details on intensity and duration. These alerts can be a life saver when you're on-the-go and don't always have time to check the weather - our systems will proactively do the work for you and let you know in advance before the rain hits.\n\nIn addition to the free features of the app, additional upgrades are available, including real-time hurricane tracking - great for the start of hurricane season. The hurricane tracker provides additional data above and beyond the free version, including the cone of probability for tropical storm/hurricane forecast tracks, and it also includes a detailed synopsis from the National Hurricane Center. The premium upgrades also include the professional radar pack, which allows greater detail of radar from individual stations. Users can select individual radar stations around the US, select the radar tilt angle, and also change the radar product being displayed, including base reflectivity and wind velocity - great for experienced weather buffs looks to stay on top of possible tornado formation.\n\nDownload MyRadar today and try it out!\n* Aviation Charts subscription (not required in order to use MyRadar) ($24.99 USD per YEAR)\n* Payments will be charged to your iTunes account\n* Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period\n* Auto-renewal may be turned off at any time by going to your settings in the iTunes Store after purchase.\n\nMyRadarâs Privacy Policy, visit: https://myradar.com/privacy\nFull terms of service: https://myradar.com/terms"

      "label": "*** AeroWeather: for pilots, aviation enthusiasts, and everyone who is serious about the weather!\n*** Current and precise weather conditions (METAR) and forecasts (TAF).\n\nAeroWeather Pro provides quick and intuitive access to METAR and TAF for airports worldwide. Data can be shown in its original (raw) format or as fully decoded and easy understandable texts. AeroWeather Pro is helpful for weather preflight-briefings, but also to just get very precise weather. All weather data is cached for offline access. \n\nIn addition to weather data, AeroWeather Pro integrates also airport NOTAMs (provided by US FAA), webcam images around airports (provided by windy.com), FlightService access (US only), and US ATC delay information (provided by US FAA). AeroWeather Pro also offers built-in groups for earthquakes, nearby stations, and today widget (pre iOS14), which can be individually enabled on the top level view. Besides creating user groups itâs also possible to put stations on the same level user groups (e.g. home base). Depending on your needs, groups can be shown or hidden in the main list view. User groups can also be synchronized via Cloud Kit*. \n\nThe app features a built-in airport database, which includes airport data like runways, sunrise/sunset, twilight times, moon times, timezones etc. \n\nMETAR alert notifications** is another new and helpful feature to stay up-to-date. Define multiple alerts for each station with criteria like: flight rule (US NOAA), wind speed, temperature, pressure, present weather, visibility etc. Notifications will be sent to your device if the criteria is met (e.g., when flight rule becomes IFR).\n\nDedicated METAR/TAF** access is optionally available. METAR/TAF data will come primarily from a certified ANSP (air navigation service provider) and is provided reliably and fast from our dedicated, redundant servers (indicated by blue checkmark underneath METAR/TAF).\n\nThe AeroPix feature offers users the possibility to take quickly picture(s) of the weather at their current location. \n\nAeroWeather Pro comes with an Apple Watch app, which shows either a list of stations as defined in the Apple Watch group or all nearby stations based on the current location. METAR and TAF are displayed for each station. In addition, you can put AeroWeather as a complication in your watch face to stay up-to-date. \n\nAn iMessage app is also included which lets you easily send METAR/TAF of any airport to other users.\n\nPlease consult our web-site for a full description of all features. \n\n* Additional functionality which needs to be unlocked (one-time purchase). These purchases are not transferable between Lite, Pro, and Mac.\n\n** SUBSCRIPTIONS\nAdditional features which generate recurring operation costs for us will be offered within a subscription. The following features are enabled while 'First' subscription is active:\n - Dedicated METAR/TAF data source\n - Meteograms\n - Alert push notifications\n - D-ATIS (bigger US airports only)\n - Area Forecast Discussions (currently US only)\n - Home Screen Widgets for METAR, Plot, Meteogram (iOS 14 or higher)\n - Imagery and Charts (requires 'Captain' subscription)\n - SIGMETs (requires 'Captain' subscription)\n\nAdditional features are also enabled when using AeroWeather Lite.\n\nThe subscription varies in time periods (1 month, 12 months). The subscription is valid in both AeroWeather Lite and Pro. Cross app subscription support is only available if iCloud (with the same Apple ID) is enabled. Previously purchased unlock features are not affected and will work with or without subscription.\n\nAuto-renewal may be turned off at any time by going to your account settings. A payment will be charged to your iTunes account at the end of the free trial period. Your iTunes account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. No commitment - you can cancel any time.\n\nPleas read the full âSubscription Terms of Useâ at:\nhttps://www.lakehorn.com/subscription-terms-of-use/"

Tidal information is essential for navigating a shallow waterway or placing your boat at anchor.  The success or failure of a voyage can depend on the height or depth of a tide, while knowledge of current information can save fuel and make passage into a river or channel safer. \n\nTides PRO goes further than the tables provided by the NOAA. The app automatically accounts for correction factors and provides instant information without requesting that you account for time lags, daylight savings conventions, or height differences between the reference stations and the locations you are seeking. \n\nSince the tidal information that is published in this app is not subjected to the use of the voyage, please do not use for navigation."

Smartphones are able to detect earthquakes thanks to the accelerometer on-board each device. When an earthquake is detected, users with the application installed are immediatly alerted. Since earthquake waves travel at around 5 km/s it is possible to alert the population not yet reached by the damaging waves of the earthquake. For the scientific details about the project please refer to the scientific paper on Frontiers at https://bit.ly/2C8B5HI\n\nSubscriptions:\n\nWhen an earthquake is detected in real time by smartphones near the epicenter, the server sends an alert to all users with the app. Alerting all users can take up to 10 seconds since it is not technically feasible to do so instantly. Now you can join the priority lists of the first 10,000 or 100,000 people alerted in real time. The following subscriptions are available:\n\n- Subscription 10k for 1 year\n- Subscription 10k for 1 month \n\n- Subscription 100k for 1 year\n- Subscription 100k for 1 month \n\nâ¢ Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\nâ¢ Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\nâ¢ Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal\nâ¢ Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase\nâ¢ Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n\nPrivacy: https://www.sismo.app/privacy\n\nTerms and conditions: https://www.sismo.app/terms-conditions"

This adds thousands of U.S. tide locations and currents. Current prediction is now supported for some locations within the U.S. only. Currents must be enabled in the application settings menu. We have also added the ability to configure the number of days of tides to display from one to fifteen days out.\n\nTide station selection has been improved. Stations can be selected either from a map or from a list view arranged by country and state or province.â¨\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n*** Regarding Tide Station Locations and Currents ***\n\nShralpTide2 contains a wealth of tide and current information for the United States thanks to the NOAA. At present the NOAA is the only provider of data for current prediction. Prediction of currents is not available for countries other than the United States.\n\nAdditionally, though tide station information is available for some countries outside of the United States, many tide stations that were previously available in the original ShralpTide are not available in ShralpTide2.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nâ¨Source code is available under the GNU General Public License.

There is now a Setting View to select which time to display in complications. Swipe left to change this Setting. As space inside different complications allows, some complications have both rise and set times and even a sun arc for daylight!

Indicators makes it simple to read this wave energy data so you can determine the best swell windows (combinations of swell period and direction) for your favorite breaks. Buoys report data every 30 minutes, giving you a much better idea of how much swell is in the water rather than a subjective \"cam watching\" report.\n\n- 6 Hour History NOAA Buoy Data\nToo often, swell arrives later than predicted. Use the 6-hour history feature to determine if the swell has arrived. If not, go back to bed. \n\n- 7 Day Forecasted NOAA Buoy Data\nGraphically view forecasted buoy data, giving you a better idea of how the swell is changing with time.\n\n\nIndicators allows you to:\n\nSTOP WASTING TIME WATCHING SURF CAMS\nWaves come in sets... So if you are watching a cam...\nAre you sure you've watched long enough to see a good set? Are you sure you weren't fooled because you saw a rogue set? If you did see a good set... wouldn't you rather be riding it?\n\nSTOP READING REPORTS THAT ONLY UPDATE TWICE PER DAY\nWho makes these reports? Dudes watching cams... (flawed). How often are these updated? Twice per day... Really? Buoy data updates every 30 mintues... (I'd pick this one)\n\nKNOW WHEN THE SURF IS GOOD IN SECONDS\nYou only need buoy data... but not just any buoy data... You need swell height, direction and period for each swell. You can use this app to determine the optimal swell direction / period for your favorite breaks..."

      "label": "Best Fishing Times tells you the best time of the day or night to catch more and bigger fish. You've probably heard that the best times to fish are at dawn and dusk, but there's more to it than that. This app can help you consistently catch your limit by giving you the exact times to hit the water!  Click \"...More\" to learn why you should download this App today!\n\n*****  Featured in \"New and Newsworthy\" and \"What's Hot\"  *****\n\n*****\n\"All I can say is I took my two boys out during the time it said.... 2 catfish, 2 brim, 1 small mouth bass. We are not fisherman just a dad and 2 boys\"\n-- David\n\nPlanning a fishing trip? Don't head down to the water before you put Best Fishing Times in your virtual tackle box. Whether you're new to fishing or a seasoned angler, this app helps ensure your success no matter where on Earth you fish. \n\nBest Fishing Times Features Include:\n* Choose a location by Manual Entry, Auto GPS or Select from Map \n* Major & Minor Feeding and Activity Periods \n* Day ratings \n* Activity Index for the day rating \n* Moon rise, Moon set and Moon Transit times \n* Moon Phase Data \n* Sunrise, Sunset and Sun Transit times \n* Day / Weekly view \n* Weather conditions and forecasts (USA)\n* Date selection for checking Solunar data in advance \n* Any Date or Location \n* Check time zone settings \n* Graphical sun and moon simulator \n* Compass \n* Wind forecast for fly fishing (data available for the USA only)\nYou've probably heard the phrase \"Timing is everything\", and those words are especially true for fishing. It's not enough to know where the fish are. If you want to catch them, you have to know when they're going to be biting. \n\nEveryone knows there are certain times of the day or night that fish are more active; and until now, most people have relied on pure luck to get their line in the water during those times. Of course there have always been dedicated anglers who don't believe in luck. They spend hours before a fishing trip checking weather conditions, studying moon phase charts and performing complicated conversions for sun and moon positions, geographical location, time zone changes and other variables. Sound like a lot of work? It doesn't have to be.\n\nNo matter which of these two groups you fall into, Best Fishing Times was designed for you! This app takes luck out of the equation, and eliminates the need for math and charts. Just pick your fishing location and the date you want to fish, and get all the information you could ever want before you even leave home. Whether you're planning for next week or next year, Best Fishing Times will get you to the water at the right time of day to catch your limit.\n\nWith a few taps of your finger, you'll see the best day of any week to go fishing, and the times of day the fish will be most active. If you prefer to check the data yourself, Best Fishing Times puts all of the information right at your fingertips, including moon phase, moon rise and moon set, major and minor activity periods for any day, and even includes a graphical sun and moon simulator!\n\nYou wouldn't go to the ball park without knowing whether or not there's a game scheduled, so why would you go fishing without knowing when the fish are biting? Download Best Fishing Times now and stop casting blindly. You'll spend less time fishing and more time catching."

To achieve the best results consider the following:\n1)  Easy calibration (only the first time): click on the calibration button (for details read the user guide accessible from the calibration page)\n2) avoid measurement in presence of loud noises (heavy traffic, motorbikes, trucks, loud talking, shots)\n3) keep your fingers away from the microphone and keep it in a vertical position\n4) orient the front of the iphone in the direction of the wind without interfering with your body\n5) click on one of the function buttons (Dynamic, Average, Spectrum)\n6) A click on the PLAY button starts the measurement\n7) A click on the RESET button clears the current measurement\n8) HINT: for long observation periods (> 1s) read the AVG value, for medium observation periods (1s) use the Average mode, for short observation periods (gusts) use the Dynamic mode.\n\nThis application is not meant to be used in place of scientific instrumentation, but with a good calibration it can come close to a real anemometer device.\n\nRead the embedded User Guide (reachable from any setting button): for any info or troubleshooting you can contact us at support@gaiacons.com."

      "label": "What better way to keep abreast of current conditions than with a beautiful METAR widget, right on your home screen? \n\nAlthough these widgets look simple, theyâve been carefully designed and built to give you the most important information at a glance, while meshing seamlessly with iOS14âs features and design language.\n\nHere are a few of the things that make these widgets special:\n\nTHEMES\nChoose a subtle theme that looks right at home on your iPhone or iPad, or a more bold and colorful theme that catches your eye more effectively.\n\nSMARTâ¦\nEach widget can figure out what weather factors to display. Generally, special weather conditions (e.g. rain, show, haze, smoke, tornadoes) take precedence, followed by any conditions that caused the current flight condition, like low cloud bases or limited visibility. Wind is always visible.\n\nâ¦ OR NOT\nAlternatively, you can use the âRetroâ theme to display raw METAR text and practice your interpretation skills (great for exam prep). Protip - put both widget types in a Stack (drag one on top of the other), so you can flip between them!\n\nREALTIME\nAll METAR widgets update in realtime, in the background. You can force a refresh anytime by simply launching the app.\n\nDARK MODE\nWidgets seamlessly follow the system-wide light/dark mode setting, which means theyâll be easier on your eyes once the sun goes down. Also, all colors across the app and widgets have been tuned to reduce eye strain when viewing in low-light conditions.\n\nFULL METAR VIEW\nTap on any widget to launch the app and view the full details. Here, you can also toggle between visual and text modes.\n\nSAVE YOUR FAVORITE STATIONS\nYou can save and manage your favorite stations in the app, which makes it even faster to set up a new widget.\n\n\n\nThanks for reading this far! Iâm an experienced software developer and a new PPL, and I built this while learning to fly in a J-3 cub. All proceeds will go to tailwheel time, and any feedback/reviews are much appreciated!"

The app gives you the best hunting times for your location, so you can plan your hunting trips much better! \nWhat people say: â¦This is a great app and I refer to it regularly during the hunting season. It's accurate! I experienced deer movement more during the times forecasted.\n\nHow does it work?

Tap on the buttons on the top to show sunrise and sunset times, day length or moonrise and moonset. Double tap on a day will add a note in the calendar.\n\nHUNTING TIMES\nThe best times for hunting during the day are shown next to an icon with three red shells. One shell icon shows just good times for hunting. Tap on the icons to see the times on a clock.\n\nVISUAL CHARTS\nAnimal activity index chart shows best time for hunting to increase hunting success during the day. The higher the value on the chart, the better chances you will have to get another trophy. \n\nTROPHY PICTURES\nStore all your trophies and their pictures on the map. If you would like to mark your favorite spot, tap on \"Map\" and place a label. Add multiple pictures of your trophies, notes and weather condition to the selected label.

This app saves me a huge headache of having to google events and hunting seasons all the time. I simply go on and see which species is \"hunt-able\" during this time of the year and I get my gear and go hunting! Very simple to use UI making it easy to have some joy in life!\n\nMuch more screenshots: \nwww.LifewareSolutions.com\n\nVideo:\nhttp://youtu.be/WWPykvtVvJM\n\nIf you like Hunting Aid, please write us a review on iTunes to keep free updates coming.

With Sol, you can check times and get reminders of solar events, at home or while traveling! Great for everyone looking to plan activities based on sunlight. Use it to remind you to walk the dog before dark, get up with the sun, or find golden hour time for that perfect photo.\n\nSol: Sun Clock is the Swiss-army knife of sunlight tools with a design inspired by the simplicity of the sundial. Use it to plan your day, guide natural sleep cycles, get the best light for outdoor photography, make sure animals or kids are safe inside before dark, or to map out the best times to go running or fishing. \n\n* Be in tune: Sol will tell you when the golden hour is, how much sunlight you have left in the day or what time the next sunrise occurs.\n\n* Look to the future, travel around the world: Sol lets you find sunlight information for any date, anywhere on earth. \n \n* Find solar midnight and solar noon, and all three twilight (dawn and dusk) periods: astronomical twilight, nautical twilight, and civil twilight. Keep tabs on the next solstice and equinox.\n \n* Reminders and Alarms: Use Sol as a natural alarm clock that you can set to any event (like sunset, golden hour or solar noon), and the alarm or reminder time will adjust gradually as the days change with the seasons.\n \n* Automatic Location: Sol not only calculates the amount of daylight and sunrise and sunset times, but does so for any location in the world (both Northern and Southern hemispheres) by using your device's GPS... no network connection required. \n\n* Other locations: Optionally, use the built-in map to choose any location in the world by moving the pin, or search using the name of any city.\n \n* Optional location-aware alarms. Sol knows when you change with your location; and as you travel it will adjust any alarms you set relative to sunrise and sunset times.  Create alarms for multiple locations around the world.\n\n* Detailed almanac information: Useful information about the day's length, sun's azimuth and elevation, equinoxes and solstices, and a friendly glossary that explains all the terms. \n\nNote: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. However, GPS runs in the background ONLY if you have set location-aware alarms."

Radar Sky proprietary radar mosaics provide radar imagery at the highest resolution on different zoom levels. \n\nRadar Sky gives you up-to-date animated radar imagery from the National Weather Service, with coverage for all 50 US states (and Puerto Rico and Guam!). \n\nRadar Sky is recommended for those who are interested in weather, astronomy, aviation, hunting, fishing, travel, own or work on a farm or ranch, a private or vacation home, or work or play in a weather-sensitive environment or industry.\n\nThe radars cannot determine precipitation type (such as rain or snow). Radar Sky uses special algorithms to delineate between rain and snow. \n\nRadar Sky shows animated weather, so you can tell if rain is headed toward or away from you, and how fast.\n\nA weather radar is used to locate precipitation, calculate its motion, estimate its type (rain, snow, hail, etc.), and forecast its future position and intensity. Radar Sky shows tornado, rain, snow, and hail clouds movement on zoomable maps around your location in real time. \n\nPrecipitation type is indicated by the color. Green color indicates lesser precipitation while the yellow color code indicates intense precipitations. The color code red is indicative of the most intense precipitations. Blue color indicates snow. \n\nFeatures:\n\n* Full, animated radar from the NWS for the entire U.S. \n* You may all of your locations to the map\n* Current weather conditions and ten-day forecast for added locations\n* play, pause animations at any zoom level \n* fast forward and rewind using manual scrollbar\n* zoom in and out, drag and scroll \n* displays current position on the map \n* multiple map styles - terrain, satellite or standard \n* supports landscape mode on iPhone and iPad \n* saves and restores your last position \n* manual refresh option"

Believe it or not, we offer access to about 40 different radar products.\n\nBut we didn't stop there! We also provide access to severe weather warnings, storm tracks, hurricane tracks, hourly precipitation forecasts, 7 day point forecasts, current temperature overlays, jet stream maps, and 3 and 6 day precipitation forecast precipitation and pressure maps and more.\n\nIf you're a detail person, feel free to read our complete list of features:\n\n- Super resolution (0.25 km) radar composites\n- Standard resolution (1 km) radar composites\n- Most Nexrad station products, including reflectivity, composite reflectivity, base and storm velocity (all at 4 scan angles), vertically integrated liquid, echo tops, one hour and storm total precipitation.\n- Most Nexrad dual polarization products, including differential reflectivity, correlation coefficient, specific differential phase, and hydrometeor classification at 4 scan levels\n- 3 and 6 day precipitation and pressure forecasts from NOAA weather models\n- 3 day jet stream forecast\n- Temperature overlay\n- Snow/mixed precipitation display (only on 1km base reflectivity radar layer)\n- 7 day forecasts and current conditions -- just press and hold for a second on the radar map\n- Hourly predicted radar\n- Severe weather (flash flood, tornado, and severe thunderstorm) warnings. Tap on a warning box to display the full warning message from the National Weather Service. Note: these are *not* push alerts. The app must be open to view the warnings\n- Cloud cover and satellite imagery for the continental United States\n- Advanced radar layers (echo tops, composite reflectivity, and storm total precipitation).\n- Play, pause, and step animations\n- Fast zoom in and zoom out\n- Choice of radar palettes\n- Multiple map styles (terrain, map, satellite, and hybrid)\n- Displays time of radar image either as absolute time or relative to the current time\n- GPS locator that finds and displays your current location\n- Adjust the transparency (opacity) of the radar or cloud cover overlays\n- Radar clutter filtering and smoothing\n- Automatic refresh when new radar or cloud cover data is available\n- Search for a location by zip code, city name, or address\n- Legend for radar and cloud cover overlays\n- Saves and restores your last location and zoom level\n\nNote: Radar coverage only includes the continental United States.

SuperRes radar has 4 times the resolution of typical weather radar products (250 meters vs 1000 meters), so you will be able to view storm features that can't be viewed in ordinary radar apps. No other app delivers radar mosaics with this kind of accuracy in such an easy to use package.\n\nIn addition to SuperRes Level 2 radar, NOAA RadarUS+ offers access to 3 km hourly forecast radar and the following features:\n\n- 3 and 6 day precipitation and pressure forecasts from NOAA weather models\n- Temperature overlay\n- Snow/mixed precipitation display (only on 1km base reflectivity radar layer)\n- 7 day forecasts and current conditions -- just press and hold for a second on the radar map.\n- Severe weather (flash flood, tornado, and severe thunderstorm) warnings. Tap on a warning box to display the full warning message from the National Weather Service. Note: these are *not* push alerts. The app must be open to view the warnings.\n- Cloud cover and satellite imagery for the continental United States\n- Advanced radar layers (echo tops, composite reflectivity, and storm total precipitation).\n- Play, pause, and step animations\n- Fast zoom in and zoom out\n- Choice of radar palettes\n- Multiple map styles (terrain, map, satellite, and hybrid)\n- Displays time of radar image either as absolute time or relative to the current time\n- GPS locator that finds and displays your current location\n- Adjust the transparency (opacity) of the radar or cloud cover overlays\n- Radar clutter filtering and smoothing\n- Automatic refresh when new radar or cloud cover data is available\n- Search for a location by zip code, city name, or address\n- Legend for radar and cloud cover overlays\n- Saves and restores your last location and zoom level\n\nNote: Radar coverage only includes the continental United States. Alaska, Hawaii, and other US controlled territories are not included. \n\nSupport:\n\nPlease follow our Twitter stream at twitter.com/shuksansoft for breaking news and status updates."

Coverage area includes the entire Contiguous (Lower 48) United States. \n\n- User-configurable filters allow you to receive notifications for the entire Contiguous US, an entire state, a local area, and/or for specific types of severe weather (tornado, hail, high wind). Use the auto-location feature of your mobile device to set a filter if you are traveling and not sure of your general location.\n\n- Filter push notifications by hail size\n\n- Optional alternate push alert sound for hail events\n\n- Map of storm events with color coded pins. Timeframes are 3-hr, full day, or archival (back to 29 Feb 2004). Touch any pin for access to details. iPod Touch or WiFi-only iPad users, data from your last view is cached for off-line use.\n\n- Filter Map View by event type and hail size\n\n- List of storm events in table form. Touch any cell in the table for a single pin street or hybrid map view. \n\n- Link to the \"Maps\" app on your home screen so you can get directions to the approximate location of severe weather events.\n\n- Storm reports may be e-mailed in an external email app.\n\n- 24 hour (with radar animation + watch boxes), 2-day, 3-day, and 4-8 day convective (thunderstorm) outlook with probability maps and technical discussion.\n\n- Mesoscale discussions with maps\n\n- Convective weather watches with maps.\n\n- Local hazardous weather products (including watches and warnings), selectable by touching a location on a map or via auto-location.\n\n*** NOTE: Watches and warnings are NOT pushed. iDamage only pushes reports of thunderstorm (convective) events.  Tropical and extratropical systems may not generate reports.\n\n- 9 pm - 9 am silence switch in Settings view. Push notifications will visually display, but alert tones are silenced.\n\n- iDamage has wildfire capability!

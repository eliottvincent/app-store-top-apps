      "label": "RadarScope is a specialized display utility for weather enthusiasts and meteorologists that allows you view NEXRAD Level 3 and Level 2 radar data along with tornado, severe thunderstorm, flash flood, special marine and snow squall warnings, and predicted storm tracks issued by the U.S. National Weather Service. It can display the latest reflectivity, velocity, dual-polarization, and other products from any NEXRAD or TDWR radar site in the United States, Guam, Puerto Rico, Korea, and Okinawa, as well as data from Environment Canada, Australian Bureau of Meteorology, Finnish Meteorological Institute, and German Weather Service radars. These aren't smoothed images, this is native radar data rendered in its original radial format for a high level of detail. \n\nWhether you are scanning reflectivity for a mesocyclone's tell-tale hook echo, trying to pinpoint the landfall of a hurricane's eye wall, or looking for small features like velocity couplets in the storm relative radial velocity product, RadarScope gives you the power to view true radial weather radar data.\n\nRadarScope displays tornado, severe thunderstorm, flash flood, special marine, and snow squall warnings issued by the U.S. National Weather Service. You can browse the list of active warnings, select a warning to view the details, and even zoom to the selected warning on the map.\n\nPinch or stretch to zoom in and out. Drag your finger around the map to scroll. Tap the radar sweep button in the toolbar to switch radars. Select one of the 289 different radars in the United States, Canada, Australia, Germany, Korea, Puerto Rico, Guam, or Okinawa. Plot your current location by tapping the location button and optionally report it to the Spotter Network. Tap the play button to download and animate over recent images. Display the names of over 25,000 cities and towns on the map as you zoom and scroll. Tap and hold the color legend to see the data values. \n\nMeanwhile, RadarScope will retrieve and display updated data automatically and intelligently (approximately every 2 to 10 minutes, depending on the radar scan strategy). \n\nYou can display radar data from our servers, NOAA's public access web site, or your Allison House subscriber account. Spotter Network members can report their location and view the locations of other spotters.\n\nRadarScope Pro is an optional auto-renewing subscription with two different tiers to choose from.\n\nRadarScope Pro Tier One is an annual subscription that provides access to real-time animated lightning data and up to 30 frames of radar data, including extended loops of super-resolution data. Tier One subscribers can also access a data interrogation tool to quickly determine data values for specific radar pixels and an optional dual-pane mode for viewing two radar products side-by-side.\n\nRadarScope Pro Tier Two is an annual or monthly subscription that combines all the features in Tier One with more advanced features, including 50-frame loops, SPC outlooks, special weather statements, mesoscale discussions, local storm reports, hail size and probability contours, and azimuthal shear contours in the U.S., a 30-day archive of all radar products, a 2-year archive of NEXRAD Level 3 radar products, a full historical archive of NEXRAD Level 2 products, and the ability to use subscription features across multiple platforms.\n\nIf you choose to buy the RadarScope Pro subscription, it will charged to your iTunes account. The subscription will be auto-renewed within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period at the same price you originally paid. Subscriptions may be managed and auto-renewal disabled via your iTunes Account Settings after the purchase. Once purchased, the subscription cannot be cancelled during the active subscription period.\n\nDTN is committed to safeguarding your privacy online.

      "label": "Thanks to everyone for making MyRadar so successful, with over 50 million downloads!\n\nMyRadar Pro is IDENTICAL to the free version of MyRadar; it comes without the ads by default.\n\nMyRadar is a fast, powerful, easy-to-use weather app that displays animated weather radar around your current location and to quickly show what weather is coming your way. Just start the app; your location pops up with animated live radar, with radar loop lengths of up to two hours. This basic functionality provides the quickest way to get a snapshot of the weather on-the-go, and it's what has made MyRadar so successful over the years. Check your phone and get an instant assessment of the weather that will impact your day.\n\nIn addition to the live radar, MyRadar has an ever-increasing list of weather and environmentally-related data layers that you can overlay on top of the map;  our animated winds layer shows a breathtaking visual representation of both surface winds and winds at the jetstream level; the frontal boundaries layer shows high and low pressure systems as well as frontal boundaries themselves; the earthquakes layer is a great way to stay on top of the latest reports on seismic activity, completely customizable as to severity and time; our hurricane layer allows users to stay on top of the latest tropical storm and hurricane activity throughout the world; the aviation layer overlays AIRMETs, SIGMETs and other aviation-related data, including the ability to track flights and display their IFR flight plans and paths, and the \"wildfires\" layer allows users to stay abreast of the latest fire activity around the United States.\n\nMyRadar also has the ability to send weather and environmental alerts, including alerts from the National Weather Service, such as Tornado and Severe Weather alerts. A new feature introduced in this version of MyRadar includes the ability to receive alerts based off of Tropical  Storm and Hurricane activity;  you can configure the app to send you an alert any time a tropical storm or hurricane forms, or is upgraded or downgraded.\n\nOne of the most useful features in MyRadar is the ability to provide advanced rain alerts; our patent-pending process for predicting hyper-local rainfall is the most accurate in the industry. Instead of having to check the app all the time, MyRadar will send you an alert up to an hour in advance as to when the rain will arrive at your current location, down to the minute, including details on intensity and duration. These alerts can be a life saver when you're on-the-go and don't always have time to check the weather - our systems will proactively do the work for you and let you know in advance before the rain hits.\n\nIn addition to the free features of the app, additional upgrades are available, including real-time hurricane tracking - great for the start of hurricane season. The hurricane tracker provides additional data above and beyond the free version, including the cone of probability for tropical storm/hurricane forecast tracks, and it also includes a detailed synopsis from the National Hurricane Center. The premium upgrades also include the professional radar pack, which allows greater detail of radar from individual stations. Users can select individual radar stations around the US, select the radar tilt angle, and also change the radar product being displayed, including base reflectivity and wind velocity - great for experienced weather buffs looks to stay on top of possible tornado formation.\n\nDownload MyRadar today and try it out!\n* Aviation Charts subscription (not required in order to use MyRadar) ($24.99 USD per YEAR)\n* Payments will be charged to your iTunes account\n* Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period\n* Auto-renewal may be turned off at any time by going to your settings in the iTunes Store after purchase.\n\nMyRadar’s Privacy Policy, visit: https://myradar.com/privacy\nFull terms of service: https://myradar.com/terms"

Besides creating user groups it’s also possible to put stations on the same level user groups (e.g. home base). Depending on your needs, groups can be shown or hidden in the main list view. User groups can also be synchronized via Cloud Kit*. \n\nThe app features a built-in airport database, which includes airport data like runways, sunrise/sunset, twilight times, moon times, timezones etc. \n\nMETAR alert notifications** is another new and helpful feature to stay up-to-date. Define multiple alerts for each station with criteria like: flight rule (US NOAA), wind speed, temperature, pressure, present weather, visibility etc. Notifications will be sent to your device if the criteria is met (e.g., when flight rule becomes IFR).\n\nDedicated METAR/TAF** access is optionally available. METAR/TAF data will come primarily from a certified ANSP (air navigation service provider) and is provided reliably and fast from our dedicated, redundant servers (indicated by blue checkmark underneath METAR/TAF).\n\nThe AeroPix feature offers users the possibility to take quickly picture(s) of the weather at their current location. \n\nAeroWeather Pro comes with an Apple Watch app, which shows either a list of stations as defined in the Apple Watch group or all nearby stations based on the current location. METAR and TAF are displayed for each station. In addition, you can put AeroWeather as a complication in your watch face to stay up-to-date. \n\nAn iMessage app is also included which lets you easily send METAR/TAF of any airport to other users.\n\nPlease consult our web-site for a full description of all features. \n\n* Additional functionality which needs to be unlocked (one-time purchase). These purchases are not transferable between Lite, Pro, and Mac.\n\n** SUBSCRIPTIONS\nAdditional features which generate recurring operation costs for us will be offered within a subscription. The following features are enabled while 'First' subscription is active:\n - Dedicated METAR/TAF data source\n - Meteograms\n - Alert push notifications\n - D-ATIS (bigger US airports only)\n - Area Forecast Discussions (currently US only)\n - Home Screen Widgets for METAR, Plot, Meteogram (iOS 14 or higher)\n - Imagery and Charts (requires 'Captain' subscription)\n - SIGMETs (requires 'Captain' subscription)\n\nAdditional features are also enabled when using AeroWeather Lite.\n\nThe subscription varies in time periods (1 month, 12 months). The subscription is valid in both AeroWeather Lite and Pro. Cross app subscription support is only available if iCloud (with the same Apple ID) is enabled. Previously purchased unlock features are not affected and will work with or without subscription.\n\nAuto-renewal may be turned off at any time by going to your account settings. A payment will be charged to your iTunes account at the end of the free trial period. Your iTunes account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. No commitment - you can cancel any time.\n\nPleas read the full “Subscription Terms of Use” at:\nhttps://www.lakehorn.com/subscription-terms-of-use/"

Pilots need to know when to turn on lights and log night flying.\n\nCivil Twilight for Watch finds your location, and calculates the sun position without going out on the internet like the other apps. Anywhere in the world! In your plane, on your boat, out on a hike! This is self-contained on the Watch and doesn't need the phone nearby either! Accurate to about a minute through the year 2050. For many more features, including sun rise and set times for other dates and places, check out our iOS app \"Civil Twilight Calculator\" on the App Store.\n\nComplications fully supported. There is now a Setting View to select which time to display in complications. Swipe left to change this Setting. As space inside different complications allows, some complications have both rise and set times and even a sun arc for daylight! Small complications allow a single user-selected time, like \"C up arrow\" for next Civil Sun Rise.\n\nThis App is for Apple Watch Series 3 and later!"

This app is for you! Easy and intuitive, it shows you the times of the golden and the blue hours.\n\nDo you have to plan your own photo session or a trip? You can change your GPS location and date within the app so you know exactly when the best time is for your photos.\n\nFeatures:\n - easy user interface\n - multiple locations management\n - event reminder by notifications\n - customizable notifications alert\n - no data connection required (weather excluded)\n - iOS 13+ dark mode support\n - weather forecasts\n - moon phases\n\nIMPORTANT: No location data is stored outside the app or shared with third parties for tracking or advertising purposes.\n\nThe Golden hour, also known as magic hour corresponds to a special and sought after condition of natural sunlight with a high diffusion, warm temperature, low incidence and limited energy. In photography the golden hour translates into soft light, warm colors, shadows so long that they tend to disappear and a good level of contrast despite the reduced dynamics. Its opposite is the Blue hour that identifies a specific condition of the solar light characterized by a colder temperature and a low energy, which, in practical terms, results in subjects with numerous penumbra, de-saturated and colder colors and intense blue sky. The golden hour occurs when the sun is very low on the horizon and therefore in the moments after sunrise and before sunset, the blue hour instead at sunset or sunrise, in twilight situation, when the sun it's below the horizon. The time, duration and intensity of these \"magical hours\" change according to the seasons, latitudes and weather conditions and therefore this app will help you to identify them perfectly.\n\n2.8 - Feb 12, 2020\n- Following the suggestion of many users the use of gps is no longer mandatory and it is now possible to use the app without being automatic located.

Make sure to use the advanced settings, they are there to maximize performance in your area.\n \n--- SERVICE AREA ---\nView the RainAware service coverage map before purchasing: https://www.rainaware.com/rainaware_coverage_map.gif\n\n--- NOTES ---\nRainAware is ONLY for use in the continental United States. RainAware relies on National Weather Service radars and may not work properly if a radar is down or if the beam is blocked by mountains. Extremely light sprinkles or drizzle may not always be detected. Precipitation times will change as RainAware adjusts to rapidly changing weather conditions. Precipitation can form suddenly or dissipate at any time. Works best when precipitation is moving. Times are estimates and have inherent error. Advanced settings are there to mitigate these issues."

Tidal information is essential for navigating a shallow waterway or placing your boat at anchor.  The success or failure of a voyage can depend on the height or depth of a tide, while knowledge of current information can save fuel and make passage into a river or channel safer. \n\nTides PRO goes further than the tables provided by the NOAA. The app automatically accounts for correction factors and provides instant information without requesting that you account for time lags, daylight savings conventions, or height differences between the reference stations and the locations you are seeking. \n\nSince the tidal information that is published in this app is not subjected to the use of the voyage, please do not use for navigation."

Live, with alarm, Telegram messages and emails.\n\nI can send you a notification with useful details so to know what is happening, but first you need to make sure that an internet connection is live.\n\nI live in iOS, meaning iPhones, iPads & iPods are my natural habitat! The oldest device I can live in is one with iOS 10.3.4, like an iPhone 5. Just leave the device charging, set up your settings & press the blue thunder.\n\nI will handle the rest. Happy to help!\n\n\nIT’S FOR THE ONE WHO :: \n• Has delicate electrical equipment that power failures might destroy them\n• Has his/her equipment destroyed from power failures (e.g. fridges)\n• Needs to be notified when power has failed\n• Needs to know the duration of power failures\n• Thinks safety is above all\n\nWHY IS USEFUL ::\n• Will wake you up when sleeping\n• Will send you an email when power has failed\n• Will send you an email when power has been restored\n• Handy in areas with tornados or earthquakes (usually power fails before the tornado).\n\nHOW IT WORKS?\nJust insert the charging cable and press play or thunder (electrical power symbol). The moment the power fails it gives you an audible & visual alarm. You will definitely be awake even if your sleep is deep. Press \"TEST\" and see for yourself. Will also send you Telegram & email notifications, just set them up correctly first.\n\nAnd when the power is off, the flashlight is there in the same screen for your convenience, in order to navigate in the dark.\n\nIDEAL OPERATION SCENARIO ::\n• Find a device no longer in use (see list below for minimum)\n• Find a working charging cable*\n• Place it on your place with the delicate equipment (fridges, incubator, dehumidifier, etc)\n• Connect it to WiFi and 3/4G\n• Adjust the Detection Sensitivity if I want to avoid micro failures (less than 3 seconds)\n• Enable & Setup Telegram\n• Enter your email\n• Turn off sound alarm\n• Start monitoring power failures\n• In case of power failure it will send you a Telegram message or email\n• You can then take action as planned for power failures.\n\nDEVICES SUPPORTED ::\n• Any iOS device with iOS 10.3 or Newer\n• iPhone 5 (updated to last iOS) (2012) or Newer\n• iPod Touch 6th Generation (2015) & Newer\n• iPad 4th Generation (2014) & Newer\n• iPad Mini 2 (2014) & Newer\n\nCheck FAQ at App Support Webpage (Information Below)\n\n\n* be aware that the device is in good working condition (ideally hold power & home buttons until you see Apple logo before operation)\n* be sure to use original battery, charging cable & charger to prevent any malfunction if charging for long periods of time.\n\n_________________\n\nIn case you need this app in your language, please contact support."

Smartphones are able to detect earthquakes thanks to the accelerometer on-board each device. When an earthquake is detected, users with the application installed are immediatly alerted. Since earthquake waves travel at around 5 km/s it is possible to alert the population not yet reached by the damaging waves of the earthquake. For the scientific details about the project please refer to the scientific paper on Frontiers at https://bit.ly/2C8B5HI\n\nSubscriptions:\n\nWhen an earthquake is detected in real time by smartphones near the epicenter, the server sends an alert to all users with the app. Alerting all users can take up to 10 seconds since it is not technically feasible to do so instantly. Now you can join the priority lists of the first 10,000 or 100,000 people alerted in real time. The following subscriptions are available:\n\n- Subscription 10k for 1 year\n- Subscription 10k for 1 month \n\n- Subscription 100k for 1 year\n- Subscription 100k for 1 month \n\n• Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\n• Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n• Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal\n• Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase\n• Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n\nPrivacy: https://www.sismo.app/privacy\n\nTerms and conditions: https://www.sismo.app/terms-conditions"

      "label": "What better way to keep abreast of current conditions than with a beautiful METAR widget, right on your home screen? \n\nAlthough these widgets look simple, they’ve been carefully designed and built to give you the most important information at a glance, while meshing seamlessly with iOS14’s features and design language.\n\nHere are a few of the things that make these widgets special:\n\nTHEMES\nChoose a subtle theme that looks right at home on your iPhone or iPad, or a more bold and colorful theme that catches your eye more effectively.\n\nSMART…\nEach widget can figure out what weather factors to display. Generally, special weather conditions (e.g. rain, show, haze, smoke, tornadoes) take precedence, followed by any conditions that caused the current flight condition, like low cloud bases or limited visibility. Wind is always visible.\n\n… OR NOT\nAlternatively, you can use the “Retro” theme to display raw METAR text and practice your interpretation skills (great for exam prep). Protip - put both widget types in a Stack (drag one on top of the other), so you can flip between them!\n\nREALTIME\nAll METAR widgets update in realtime, in the background. You can force a refresh anytime by simply launching the app.\n\nDARK MODE\nWidgets seamlessly follow the system-wide light/dark mode setting, which means they’ll be easier on your eyes once the sun goes down. Also, all colors across the app and widgets have been tuned to reduce eye strain when viewing in low-light conditions.\n\nFULL METAR VIEW\nTap on any widget to launch the app and view the full details. Here, you can also toggle between visual and text modes.\n\nSAVE YOUR FAVORITE STATIONS\nYou can save and manage your favorite stations in the app, which makes it even faster to set up a new widget.\n\n\n\nThanks for reading this far! I’m an experienced software developer and a new PPL, and I built this while learning to fly in a J-3 cub. All proceeds will go to tailwheel time, and any feedback/reviews are much appreciated!"

      "label": "The venerable U.S. weather app Wx, named a Mac Gem by Macworld magazine, is now available for iPhone! Wx displays current conditions, forecasts, alerts, and radar for U.S. locations using high fidelity XML data from the U.S. National Weather Service. The app is designed for two specific types of customers: serious weather watchers who want detailed information and facts with no fuss, and casual users who want a fast, clean, and functional weather app that has low memory overhead and low CPU/battery usage. \n\nWx lets you choose your location on an embedded map, and uses that to setup custom forecasts based on the latitude and longitude of the location.  Forecasts include a 7-day summary \"point\" forecast, and a 7-day “pro” forecast that graphs temperature (actual and apparent), dew point, relative humidity, cloud cover, wind speed, wind direction, gust speed, 12-hour probability of precipitation, 6-hour liquid precipitation amount, and 6-hour snow amount.  These forecasts are about as good as it gets if you need to plan work, sports, hobbies, and outdoor activities based on upcoming weather.  With their high spatial resolution, the point and pro forecasts are especially useful in coastal and mountainous regions, where typical zone forecasts can be inaccurate.\n\nWx also lets you receive current conditions data from nearby NWS observation sites (over 1700 available in the U.S. and its territories), get radar data from nearby NEXRAD radar sites, and receive warnings from nearby city- and county-based alert zones.  \n\nWx lets you bookmark and setup weather maps for quick reference. Choose from some default NWS maps and images, or provide the URL for any map of your choice and load it right in the app! If you have preferred weather providers, you can load your favorite maps and images right in Wx and keep them handy. \n\nWx is crafted with attention to detail by a professional software developer with 29 years of experience, 15 years focused on developing weather software for OS X and 12 years writing apps for iOS devices. Wx has multiple levels of redundancy to handle severe weather events that can strain NWS servers, and even offers network settings for both Wi-Fi and cellular operation so that you can fine tune the app’s performance and bandwidth needs.\n\nWx is also available for the iPad and OS X. See hrtapps.com for more info.\n\n***NOTE***  If you need support or help, or have feedback, suggestions, or feature requests, please contact us via the support link (above) or on our website at hrtapps.com."

      "label": "WeatherFX is an app that is helpful to people who either work or play outdoors.\nFeatures:\n• Current International Weather Conditions\n• Up to 5 days of forecast data\n• Map with your location and closest weather station\n• Heat Flag Condition\n• Fluid Consumption and work Rest Ratios\n• Manual and Random Estimations\n• Spanish, French, Portuguese and Dutch Languages\n• Locale Support for time and measurements\n  \n  The app can provide guidance on work/rest ratios and fluid intake due to high temperatures. WeatherFX is an app that can retrieve temperature, barometric pressure and relative humidity based on the iPhone/iPad GPS data. The app will also approximate the wet bulb and wet bulb globe (WBGT) temperatures from the retrieved values. Please note that the WBGT is just an estimate. The estimate does not account for wind or low light conditions. The estimate is based on a moderate amount of sunlight. True WBGT can only be acquired through WBGT instrumentation. \n  Once you accept the prompt to acquire the GPS position, the Latitude and Longitude labels will be populated. Click the “Update” button and the app will populate the temperature, pressure and humidity text fields based the closest weather Station ID to your position. The app will then calculate the wet bulb and WBGT temperatures. You'll also notice that the WeatherFX app will place the location name and time of the reading at the top of the screen. This way you will know if the readings are in your location and timely. \n  Besides acquiring the weather from GPS you may get your own estimates for wet bulb and WBGT temperatures by typing temperature, pressure and humidity into the respective text fields. Click the “Manual” segmented button, enter the white fields followed by clicking the “Update” button. \n  The app will also compute random numbers for temperature, pressure and humidity clicking the \"Shake\" segmented button.  The device may be shaken and new settings will populate the fields.  Click update button and the random wet bulb and WBGT temperatures will be computed.  \nAfter an update has been executed, you may use WeatherFX to quickly convert temperatures from Fahrenheit to Celsius and vice versa by clicking the desired “°F” or \"°C” segmented buttons. Barometric pressure may be converted from inches mercury to millibars and vice versa by clicking the desired “in” or “mBar” segmented buttons. \nAfter an update you will be presented with a flag condition button on the bottom left of the screen. The flag condition is derived from the WBGT estimate. If the flag condition is not “NONE”, you may click on the condition to yield work to rest ratios and water consumption given the current estimated flag condition. These figures are posted as a quick and portable reference only. Guidance for these figures are acquired from the U.S. Marine Corps Order 6200.1E dated June, 2002. You are strongly advised to read the complete guidance to know what each entry means."

It also displays the current temperature and humidity.\n• Display barometric pressure (sensor value) or mean sea level pressure (MSLP - value used in weather forecast services or stations).\n• Units support for pressure: mb, inHg, kPa, atm, Torr, psi, hPa, mmHg. Units for altitude: meter, feet.\n• Calibrate the barometer using altitude/location from the GPS. Calibrate the altimeter using the nearest airport information/METAR, or manually enter the QNH of the nearest airport. Offset sensor output value.\n• Measure the height (building/mountain/hiked/climbed) using the \"Relative Altitude\" feature (can be enabled in the app's Settings).\n• Notification about pressure change. \"Notification custom rule\" for you to define how and when the app sends notifications.\nNotify when air pressure changes indicate that extreme or worse weather may occur.\n• \"Pressure Tracking\" and \"History Graph\" require \"Background App Refresh\" or \"Always Location Service\" with \"Exact update interval\" enabled.\n• \"My Area\" allows you to define your frequent stay places, and the app tracks air pressure with location data.\n• Export history to CSV format and Today widget.\n• This app is the digital version compared with an aneroid or mercury barometer and can be adjusted to MSLP with additional features.\n\nCUSTOMIZABLE:\nYou can change your barometer/altimeter appearance with:\n• Seven different housing colors.\n• Black, white or blue disk background.\n• Four different app backgrounds.\n• Three different types of needles.\n• Marker needle for easily monitor.\n• Dark or light Today widget theme.\n\nNOTES:\n• App only works on devices with a barometer sensor, such as iPhone 6/6s/7/8/X/11/12/13 (including Plus models), iPad Mini 4/Air 2/Pro, or later.\n• Weather icons on the dial: This only shows the air pressure trend like in an analog barometer.\n• Each time your device reboots, open the app for tracking with the \"Exact update interval\" feature work.\n• You may take the phone/tablet far away from computers, cables, and other magnetic sources to get accurate results.\n• This app is Pro / Premium version of the \"Barometer Plus - Altimeter\" app, only difference is all feature unlocked and no ads.

You can either watch live in HD ad free or get directions to the show.\n\nSet your alert level, Visible to the eye, Aurora moving slowly, or Sky's Alive.\n\nUnlike all other alert apps in existence, which rely on NOAA ‘space weather’ forecasts that requires experience to use, and is often old data, Live Aurora Network sends out real time alerts based on what is actually seen in the sky, we send alerts based on the visual detection of aurora from our Network of Cameras. currently in Iceland, Norway, Alaska, USA, Sweden\n\nOur unique algorithm not only detects the aurora borealis, but visually grades it based on the strength of the aurora. Users can choose the level they wish to be notified at so that they need only hit the road for displays they deem suitable.\n\nAll other top selling Aurora notification apps currently on the market are based on the global Kp index which runs from 0-9 and is based on magnetometers around the world. This is problematic for local aurora alerts, and not the most effective parameter for knowing when local auroral activity is highest.\n\nLive Aurora Network pushes out alerts in real time, thanks to software designed to detect the colours of the Aurora, while grading the density and percentage of the sky that is showing the lights. This is especially helpful to find breaks in the clouds!\n\nAlso, in this app:\n- HD live stream from every location\n- Zoomable map of Iceland, Norway, USA, Sweden, Alaska with directions to our dark sky areas.\n- Localized weather forecast at each location.\n- Current Live KP rating\n- Customisable alert level"

Enable time travel to see the tide level at any point in the day.\n\nOn the iPhone an interactive tide graph is displayed by turning your device to landscape mode. Then touch the screen to see the tide at any time in the 24 hour window. No network connection is required, so you can check anytime, anywhere.\n\nNew on iPad you now see a month-to-month tide calendar.

Allows navigation through the coming months or backward if you want to see what the tide was on a past beach visit.\n\nRuns on the current XTide 2.x codebase. This adds thousands of U.S. tide locations and currents. Current prediction is now supported for some locations within the U.S. only. Currents must be enabled in the application settings menu.

At present the NOAA is the only provider of data for current prediction.

The wind chill factor can not lower a temperature below the current air temperature, but instead it speeds up the decrease in temperature proportional the speed of the wind\n\nBoth the Old model for calculating the Wind Chill Factor, pre-2001 formula, and the New Wind Chill Index devised by the National Weather Service in 2001 are used. The values are calculated to the second decimal place for extra accuracy.\n\nInputs for Air Temperature can be given as Fahrenheit or Celsius. Acceptable inputs for wind velocity are Knots, Miles per Hour, and Kilometers per Hour. \n\nThis app features: \n\n• Send your calculations or conversions by email \n• Universal App (iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad)\n• All iPhone and iPad screen sizes are supported\n• Retina Display graphics \n• Fast app switching \n• Automatically Saves Your Inputs \n• Latest version of iOS is supported\n\nNo network connectivity required.\n\nNote: Windchill Temperature is only defined for temperatures at or below 50 degrees F and wind speeds above 3 mph."

      "label": "One of the easiest ways to become a happier person is to experience more sunlight every day. Skylight can help make that happen through a beautiful app experience designed for everyone.\n\nCreate a routine around sunrise every morning. Remind yourself to step out at solar noon for a sun break. Take better photos by shooting during Golden Hour. Start getting outside to see the sunset more. Gain a better sense of sunlight lost and gained through the seasons and adjust your routine to make sure you get enough light. Motivate yourself through the winter months by reminding yourself that days are getting longer. The uses are endless but the goal is the same - better living through more sunlight.\n\nSkylight includes a universal app for iPad and iPhone, an Apple Watch app with complications, and three widgets. The Apple Watch complications show you how much sunlight is left in the day, or when upcoming events like Golden Hour are taking place. The complications are a beautiful addition to the watch face and offer one of the most effective ways to use the app. The Today Widget shows you the app information in a quick, glanceable form, so daylight info is always at your fingertips, either in your Today view or with a 3D Touch on the app icon.\n\nFeatures include:\n- Beautiful fluid visual display showing the position of the sun over time.\n- Comprehensive notifications & alarms for daily and yearly sun events.\n- Three different configurable widgets: Year Graph, Daylight Graph, and Gradient.\n- Apple Watch app and complications with daylight clock and events.\n- Year view, showing the entire year's daily sun events with a simple drag of your finger.\n- Detailed event views, describing each sun event and showing the earliest and latest. dates on which it occurs.\n- Date picker to see sun information from dates in the past or future.\n- Location picker to see sun events and graphs for anywhere on earth.\n- Multiple time modes, including specialized modes for photography and science.\n- Support for all display sizes and device orientations.\n- Spotlight support, so you can just type \"Golden Hour\" from your phone's home screen to pull up today's info.\n- Skylight can optionally use GPS in the background to ensure notifications are correct even if you change location.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nSkylight is an indie app developed by the creators of Magic Window. We strive to make beautiful software that connects people with the world. If you have any issues or questions please contact us at support@jetsoncreative.com."

In 1662 Christopher Wren invented the rocking rain gauge, the prototype of the modern rain gauges, which was perfected in 1670 by Robert Hooke.\nUp to about 10-20 years ago it was indicated as rain gauges those instruments that in fact they had no way to record the time evolution of the rain and which were controlled to a daily basis.\nUnlike the pluviograph was a tool that could, by means of a mechanical registration system, to graphically report the amount of rain fall in a certain time interval\nWith the development  of electronics and then computer science , the pluviographs have gone increasingly asserting itself.\n\n[Design]\n\nThe graphics are perfected to the last detail to make using simple, fluid and pleasant.\nOptimized for Retina Display on the iPhone and iPad.\n\n[Supported languages]\n\n• English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Danish, Finnish, Norwegian, Swedish.\n\n[Support]\n\nIf you like the app, don’t forget to leave us a review on the App Store.\nFor suggestions please contact us at info@lionsapp.com, or visit lionsapp.com."

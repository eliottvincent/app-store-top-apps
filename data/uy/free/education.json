      "label": "Pl@ntNet is an application that allows you to identify plants simply by photographing them with your smartphone. Very useful when you don't have a botanist on hand!\n\nPl@ntNet is also a great citizen science project: all the plants you photograph are collected and analysed by scientists around the world to better understand the evolution of plant biodiversity and to better preserve it.\n\nPl@ntNet allows you to identify and better understand all kinds of plants living in nature: flowering plants, trees, grasses, conifers, ferns, vines, wild salads, cacti (and many more). \n\nPl@ntNet can also identify a large number of cultivated plants (in parks and gardens) but this is not its primary purpose. We especially need Pl@ntNet’s users to inventory the wild plants, those that you can observe in nature, but also those that grow on the sidewalks of cities or in the middle of your vegetable garden!\n\nThe more visual information you give to Pl@ntNet about the plant you are observing, the more accurate the identification will be. There are indeed many plants that look alike from afar and it is sometimes small details that distinguish two species of the same genus. \n\nFlowers, fruits and leaves are the most characteristic organs of a species and it is them that should be photographed first. But any other detail can be useful, such as thorns, buds or hair on the stem. A photograph of the whole plant is also very useful information, but it is often not sufficient to allow a reliable identification.\n\nAt present, Pl@ntNet makes it possible to recognize about 20,000 species. We are still a long way from the 360,000 species living on earth, but Pl@ntNet is getting richer every day thanks to the contributions of the most experienced users among you. \n\nDon't be afraid to contribute yourself! Your observation will be reviewed by the community and may one day join the photo gallery illustrating the species in the application.\n\nThe new version of Pl@ntNet released in January 2019 includes many improvements and new features:\n-The ability to filter recognized species by genus or family.\n-The differentiated data revision that gives more weight to users who have demonstrated the most skills (in particular the number of species observed, validated by the community).\n-The re-identification of shared observations, whether yours or those of other users of the application.\n-The multi-flora identification that allows you to search for the photographed plant in all the flora of the application and not only in the one you have selected. Very useful when you are not sure what flora to look for.\n-The selection of your favorite floras to access them more quickly.\n-The navigation at different taxonomic levels in image galleries.\n-The mapping of your observations.\n-Links to many factsheets.\n\nThe web version of the application is also available at the following address: https://identify.plantnet.org/"

The user interface is beautiful and straightforward, the controls are easy to use and most settings are just a tap or two away. Classic Sky Map shows you thousands of the brightest stars, the Moon, planets, constellations, meteor showers and more. And it's painless. \n\n\nFree Features:\n\n- Live Tracking. Simply point your device toward the stars and the sky map aligns itself automatically, showing you the portion of the sky at which you are looking. If your device has a compass, Classic Sky Map uses it automatically. If not, you can tell Classic Sky Map where the North is, and it aligns the sky map accordingly.\n\n- Live Earth Map. Quickly jump from one city to another by tapping on a map that shows the Earth's day and night boundary in real-time. If you allow it, Classic Sky Map can detect your current location automatically. You can also create custom viewing locations in seconds.\n\n- Fast Forward and Rewind. Accelerate or reverse time to understand how stars and planets appear to move in the sky over a longer period of time.\n\n- Beautiful Constellation Images. We put a tremendous amount of work into creating beautiful constellation images inspired by antique engravings and aligning them precisely with the stars.\n\n- Sharing. Share snapshots of the sky map with your friends at the tap of a button.\n\n- Quick Help. Should you have any questions while using Classic Sky Map, a concise, illustrated user guide will help answer them quickly.\n\n\nFull Version Features (In-App Purchase):\n\n- Interactive Search. Simply type in a search field, pick an object from a list of matches, then point your device toward the sky. An arrow appears and guides you until you are pointing your device toward the object you selected. If the object is not yet visible in the sky, its next rise time is displayed.\n\n- Sky Events. Classic Sky Map shows a list of current sky events such as meteor showers, eclipses and more and helps you quickly locate them in the sky.\n\n- Night Vision. Classic Sky Map's night vision mode helps minimize loss of dark adaptation. And we went the extra mile to make it look great in cyan, orange or red.\n\n- Extra Information. Tooltips and an information panel show details about stars, planets, the Moon, meteor showers and more.\n\n- Personalization Options. Personalize your sky map by turning various guides and display options on or off.\n\n\nHave fun!"

      "label": "We are a Ukrainian software developer creating apps for kids. We will continue in the hopes that there will soon be peace for our children and children all around the world!\n\nDrawing Academy from Bini Games (ex-Bini Bambini) is a unique app where kids are inspired to learn by drawing. In our app, drawing gets children excited even for letters and numbers!\n\nIn preschoolers, drawing plays an important role in the development of the right side of the brain. As they draw, children process information in multiple ways, such as with their eyes and body, as well as emotionally. We created the Drawing Academy app with all this in mind.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n- 150 step-by step drawing tutorials in 10 thematic sets with different complexity levels for kids aged 2 to 6\n- “ABC\" and \"Numbers” packs to get children interested in learning letters and numbers through drawing with pictures they make themselves\n- a huge variety of tools, including pencils, crayons, stickers, patterns, and paints\n- tracing and free-drawing mechanics to help prepare your child’s hand for writing with step-by-step motor-skill refinement, from the moment they first scribble to their finalized masterpieces\n- activities that form a customized age-based learning program, taking your child’s interests into account\n- unique easy-to-follow tracing exercises that guide your child’s creativity without limitations and stimulating free drawing\n\nDrawing Academy isn’t just another coloring book!\n\nNote: only part of the content in the screenshots is available in the free version of the application. To gain access to the full version, you will need to make an in-app purchase.\n\nSubscription Details\n\nGet access to over 100 cute characters and drawings after subscribing to the Drawing Academy. Just download and go!\n\nA free 7-day trial period is available to you, or you can subscribe right after download.\n\nAfter your free trial, your subscription will automatically start unless you adjust your subscription settings at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.\n\nWe provide different subscription options for your convenience: monthly and annual subscription.\n\nIf you change your mind at any point, cancellation is easy through your iTunes settings.\n\nPayment for subscriptions will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\n\nYour subscription automatically renews unless you turn the renewal feature off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.\n\nYou will be charged for renewal within 24 hours of the end of the current period.\n\nYou can cancel your subscription anytime through your Account Settings without any cancellation fees.\n\nYou can use your subscription on any device registered with your Apple ID.\n\nABOUT BINI GAMES \n\nBini Games (ex-Bini Bambini) was started in 2012 by four parents with experience in children's education. And today, we are a 250-people team of dedicated designers, artists, animators, and educators. To date, we have more than 30 apps, with our user base having reached 98M.\n\nWe are inspired by the idea of bringing fun into early education and enhancing a child's natural love of learning through educational apps for kids.\n\nIf you need help, have questions or just want to say “hi!”, get in touch at feedback@bini.games\nhttps://binibambini.com/terms-of-use/\nhttps://binibambini.com/privacy-policy/\n\nAll our games are safe, and do not collect any personal information."

      "label": "Sky Live is a great app for planning the star observations and for making gorgeous photos of the starry night sky. Lots of astronomers and night sky photographers worldwide have chosen the app to help them in planning their nights out for watching stars, planets and constellations.\n\nAll necessary info is available at once: what planets, bright stars and constellations will be above the horizon at night, what the weather is like, what the visibility score is, and much more. After setting the location you can check the stargazing index for the whole week ahead and learn the best time for the night out. \n\nThe unique index for stargazing conditions is calculated hourly and renews each time you start the app. The index depends on the following criteria:\n\n- Weather forecast\n- Light Pollution\n- Visible objects\n- The Moonlight​\n\nThe Sky Live app works in pair with Star Walk 2 that means you can see the chosen object in the sky and check more info about its’ path through the night sky. Sky Live also has an Apple Watch extension to alert you of upcoming astronomical events and tell you what’s going on in the sky over your location at the moment, e.g. ISS flyby or bright Iridium flare.\n\n\"For stargazers, Sky Live is exactly the app we've always needed to find out just how much of the stars we can see at night and when we'll be able to see our favourite constellations and planets.\" by Nathan Snelgrove, AppStorm.net.\n\nStunning space photos combined with everything you need to know about stargazing conditions for your location tonight. Stargazer or not - this app will spark your curiosity. \n\nThe most accurate hourly conditions for stargazing are estimated on seven criteria and summarized in one Stargazing Index that will give you all the information you need to make your plans. The formula was developed by a mathematician on the Star Walk team and takes into account: \n\n- Is there anything interesting in the sky tonight? \n- Can I see Saturn? \n- Is it going to be cloudy? \n- Is it going to rain? \n- Too much light? \n- Is the Moon too bright for stargazing? \n\nYou will also get detailed reports on position and trajectory of the International Space Station, the Sun, the Moon, Jupiter and other planets. The forecast is available for seven days ahead."

Es por eso que creamos Check, una herramienta perfecta que te permitirá ejercitarse en tu celular, sin importar dónde estás y te dejará acceder a tu información personal y detalladas sobre tu desempeño, así podés saber en qué cosas estás más flojo y en qué cosas estás mejor. Al mismo tiempo Check, te deja ver todo el material adjunto que los profesores suban y los videos que acompañen a sus clases, conocer un ranking para saber qué posición estás ocupando con tu desempeño y hacer pruebas desde tu celular, para que tu preparación para cada examen, para cada prueba sea mucho mejor y se adapte a vos.\n\nIDEAL PARA PROFESORES\nLas funcionalidades de Check están pensadas para ayudar al profesor y de esta manera, ser un aliado para lograr que más alumnos aprueben los cursos que dictan y mejoren su desempeño. En nuestra app van a poder crear un temario, crear ejercicios utilizando texto o imágenes, crear entregas, adjuntar material y subir videos o audios. Al mismo tiempo van a poder conocer el desempeño global de la materia en tiempo real y también el desempeño de cada uno de los alumnos para lograr una clase más personalizada. \nEn Check las entregas son altamente seteables, permitiéndole al profesor un manejo diferente de las mismas donde ya no se va a tener que preocupar por finalizar una entrega o corregir una por una las preguntas planteadas. Estas entregas servirán al mismo tiempo para establecer un ranking entre los alumnos, lo que le permitirá al profesor conocer quiénes son los alumnos con mejor rendimiento.\n\nIDEAL PARA GESTIONAR TU CENTRO EDUCATIVO\nCheck es una herramienta que conjuga la experiencia web junto con la experiencia mobile, dejando que los profesores puedan, en la web, agregar alumnos de manera muy sencilla a través de un archivo csv que debe comprender algunos datos básicos. Luego de esto la plataforma se encarga de la creación de los distintos grupos que pueden estar comprendidos en una materia y también de enviar una invitación de manera automática a cada uno de los alumnos agregados.\nAdemás un profesor puede intercambiar ejercicios con otras materias, agregar a nuevos profesores, ver el desempeño de los alumnos en distintas materias y tener la información básica de su centro educativo sin importar la plataforma que esté utilizando."

The app provides an exciting experience marked by a thoughtful design.\n\nWith ISS Live Now, you can view interesting live video streams directly from the International Space Station’s cameras.\n\nThe app utilizes the native Google Map (ISS tracker), which allows you to follow the Space Station’s orbit around our planet. You can zoom, rotate, drag and tilt the map;.\n\nYou will have these different sources of live video streaming, including:\n1. Live standard camera: It shows a live stream of the Earth and, from time to time, details about the ISS (like tests, maintenance and communication with Earth).\n2. NASA TV: The television service of the United States government agency NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration). You can watch science and space documentaries, interview with scientists, astronauts, engineers and personalities such as Elon Musk.\n3. NASA TV Media.\n4. Spacewalk (recorded): Beautiful HD images of astronauts from cameras outside the ISS.\n5. Inside the International Space Station: Take a video tour of each module inside the ISS, all explained by the astronauts.\n6. Eventual channel: Temporary live cameras from NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), the Russian Space Agency (Roscosmos) and the SpaceX.\n\nYou even have the option to be notified when the next sunset or sunrise will occur, allowing you to watch it live directly from the International Space Station. \n\nNote:\nWhen the ISS (International Space Station) is on the night side of Earth, the video image is black, which is normal.\n\nSometimes, video is not available due to transmission issues, or because the crew is changing cameras. In such cases, you will usually have a blue or blank screen. In a few minutes the transmission should return, so, please be patient.

      "label": "Pl@ntNet is an application that allows you to identify plants simply by photographing them with your smartphone. Very useful when you don't have a botanist on hand!\n\nPl@ntNet is also a great citizen science project: all the plants you photograph are collected and analysed by scientists around the world to better understand the evolution of plant biodiversity and to better preserve it.\n\nPl@ntNet allows you to identify and better understand all kinds of plants living in nature: flowering plants, trees, grasses, conifers, ferns, vines, wild salads, cacti (and many more). \n\nPl@ntNet can also identify a large number of cultivated plants (in parks and gardens) but this is not its primary purpose. We especially need Pl@ntNet’s users to inventory the wild plants, those that you can observe in nature, but also those that grow on the sidewalks of cities or in the middle of your vegetable garden!\n\nThe more visual information you give to Pl@ntNet about the plant you are observing, the more accurate the identification will be. There are indeed many plants that look alike from afar and it is sometimes small details that distinguish two species of the same genus. \n\nFlowers, fruits and leaves are the most characteristic organs of a species and it is them that should be photographed first. But any other detail can be useful, such as thorns, buds or hair on the stem. A photograph of the whole plant is also very useful information, but it is often not sufficient to allow a reliable identification.\n\nAt present, Pl@ntNet makes it possible to recognize about 20,000 species. We are still a long way from the 360,000 species living on earth, but Pl@ntNet is getting richer every day thanks to the contributions of the most experienced users among you. \n\nDon't be afraid to contribute yourself! Your observation will be reviewed by the community and may one day join the photo gallery illustrating the species in the application.\n\nThe new version of Pl@ntNet released in January 2019 includes many improvements and new features:\n-The ability to filter recognized species by genus or family.\n-The differentiated data revision that gives more weight to users who have demonstrated the most skills (in particular the number of species observed, validated by the community).\n-The re-identification of shared observations, whether yours or those of other users of the application.\n-The multi-flora identification that allows you to search for the photographed plant in all the flora of the application and not only in the one you have selected. Very useful when you are not sure what flora to look for.\n-The selection of your favorite floras to access them more quickly.\n-The navigation at different taxonomic levels in image galleries.\n-The mapping of your observations.\n-Links to many factsheets.\n\nThe web version of the application is also available at the following address: https://identify.plantnet.org/"

Después de estudiar las reglas gramaticales, se le ofrece una tarea auditiva con el fin de entender frases en inglés.\n\n4. Creamos un sistema de tareas de toda clase que llamamos ENTRENADOR.

Classroom makes it easy for learners and instructors to connect—inside and outside of schools. Classroom saves time and paper, and makes it easy to create classes, distribute assignments, communicate, and stay organized.\n\nClassroom is designed to help teachers create, collect, and grade assignments paperlessly, including time-saving features like the ability to automatically make a copy of a Google Document for each student. It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organized.\n\nStudents can keep track of what’s due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and grades right in Classroom.\n\nWith the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and grade the assignment - at school or on the go. Students and teachers receive notifications when they have new content in Classroom, so they are always up to date.\n\nThere are many benefits of using Classroom:\n\nEasy to set up\nTeachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It takes just minutes to set up.\n\nSaves time\nThe simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review, and grade assignments quickly, all in one place.\n\nImproves organization\nStudents can see all of their assignments on an assignments page, and all class materials (e.g., documents, photos, and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.\n\nEnhances communication\nClassroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.\n\nSecure\nLike the rest of Google Workspace for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes.\n\nPermissions Notice:\nCamera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.\nMicrophone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.\nPhotos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom. Photos or videos posted to Classroom will be stored on Google servers in order to show them in Classroom."

Playing is as easy as tapping and dragging the characters to move them around so that different real world situations can be recreated. Most objects can be dragged around and moved in the scenes. Some items can be tapped to perform different specific actions like turning a light bulb ON and OFF or opening doors to go to other rooms. Make sure to check the Kitchen to find the hundreds of recipes. Just combining one ingredient with another can make new dishes like adding bread and cheese will create a cheese sandwich. However,  there are a few more complicated recipes which can be created by combining multiple ingredients in the oven and turning it ON. Be careful though, if they don’t combine well together, you will get a burnt dish… Yuck! Exploring is key in Lila’s world so make sure you check all the different areas of the game. There are many secrets hidden all around Grandma’s house so the more you explore, the more you will find. \n  \nCREATE - DRAWING and COLORING:\nOne of the most unique aspects of our game is the Create section. Here, users are encouraged to create their own scenes. Use the Create button to add your own items into the game. If you want your favorite toy in the game just make a drawing of it, take a picture from the Create menu and you can have it right in the game with you. Your favorite meal is not in the game? No problem, make a drawing of it and add it in yourself. Do you want to enter the game yourself? No problem, just make a drawing of yourself and enter the game directly. Maybe you want a different scene to play in but you don’t want to draw it yourself. Also, coming soon is the ability to browse other people's scenes and download them too. Soon you will be able to share your scenes and visit your friends scenes too.\n\nLEARN:\nNew Scenes every month. Learn about the following:\n- Different festivals from around the world\n- New cities to explore\n- A trip down your neighborhood \n\nSAFE FOR KIDS:\n\"Lila's World\" is absolutely safe for kids. Even while we allow kids to play with other kid's creations from around the world, we make sure all our content is moderated and nothing is approved without getting approved first. We collect no personal information and your can play completely offline if you want as well.\n\nYou can find our Terms of Use here:\nhttps://photontadpole.com/terms-and-conditions-lila-s-world\n\nYou can find our Privacy Policy here:\nhttps://photontadpole.com/privacy-policy-lila-s-world\n\nThis App has No Ads or no Social Media links.\n\nIf you have any questions, you can email us at support@photontadpole.com"

También incluye un kit de construcción de varias piezas, un puzzle que, al resolverlo, genera una imagen que describe determinada palabra.\n\nEn cuanto el puzzle está resuelto, la imagen cobra vida milagrosamente.\nLas animadas y simpáticas letras en cajas ayudarán al niño a aprender el abecedario y a leer más de 100 palabras diferentes.

      "label": "Ever wonder why so many astronomy apps are so hard to use? We do. So we made Classic Sky Map simple and intuitive enough for anyone to enjoy. The user interface is beautiful and straightforward, the controls are easy to use and most settings are just a tap or two away. Classic Sky Map shows you thousands of the brightest stars, the Moon, planets, constellations, meteor showers and more. And it's painless. \n\n\nFree Features:\n\n- Live Tracking. Simply point your device toward the stars and the sky map aligns itself automatically, showing you the portion of the sky at which you are looking. If your device has a compass, Classic Sky Map uses it automatically. If not, you can tell Classic Sky Map where the North is, and it aligns the sky map accordingly.\n\n- Live Earth Map. Quickly jump from one city to another by tapping on a map that shows the Earth's day and night boundary in real-time. If you allow it, Classic Sky Map can detect your current location automatically. You can also create custom viewing locations in seconds.\n\n- Fast Forward and Rewind. Accelerate or reverse time to understand how stars and planets appear to move in the sky over a longer period of time.\n\n- Beautiful Constellation Images. We put a tremendous amount of work into creating beautiful constellation images inspired by antique engravings and aligning them precisely with the stars.\n\n- Sharing. Share snapshots of the sky map with your friends at the tap of a button.\n\n- Quick Help. Should you have any questions while using Classic Sky Map, a concise, illustrated user guide will help answer them quickly.\n\n\nFull Version Features (In-App Purchase):\n\n- Interactive Search. Simply type in a search field, pick an object from a list of matches, then point your device toward the sky. An arrow appears and guides you until you are pointing your device toward the object you selected. If the object is not yet visible in the sky, its next rise time is displayed.\n\n- Sky Events. Classic Sky Map shows a list of current sky events such as meteor showers, eclipses and more and helps you quickly locate them in the sky.\n\n- Night Vision. Classic Sky Map's night vision mode helps minimize loss of dark adaptation. And we went the extra mile to make it look great in cyan, orange or red.\n\n- Extra Information. Tooltips and an information panel show details about stars, planets, the Moon, meteor showers and more.\n\n- Personalization Options. Personalize your sky map by turning various guides and display options on or off.\n\n\nHave fun!"

      "label": "Pl@ntNet is an application that allows you to identify plants simply by photographing them with your smartphone. Very useful when you don't have a botanist on hand!\n\nPl@ntNet is also a great citizen science project: all the plants you photograph are collected and analysed by scientists around the world to better understand the evolution of plant biodiversity and to better preserve it.\n\nPl@ntNet allows you to identify and better understand all kinds of plants living in nature: flowering plants, trees, grasses, conifers, ferns, vines, wild salads, cacti (and many more). \n\nPl@ntNet can also identify a large number of cultivated plants (in parks and gardens) but this is not its primary purpose. We especially need Pl@ntNet’s users to inventory the wild plants, those that you can observe in nature, but also those that grow on the sidewalks of cities or in the middle of your vegetable garden!\n\nThe more visual information you give to Pl@ntNet about the plant you are observing, the more accurate the identification will be. There are indeed many plants that look alike from afar and it is sometimes small details that distinguish two species of the same genus. \n\nFlowers, fruits and leaves are the most characteristic organs of a species and it is them that should be photographed first. But any other detail can be useful, such as thorns, buds or hair on the stem. A photograph of the whole plant is also very useful information, but it is often not sufficient to allow a reliable identification.\n\nAt present, Pl@ntNet makes it possible to recognize about 20,000 species. We are still a long way from the 360,000 species living on earth, but Pl@ntNet is getting richer every day thanks to the contributions of the most experienced users among you. \n\nDon't be afraid to contribute yourself! Your observation will be reviewed by the community and may one day join the photo gallery illustrating the species in the application.\n\nThe new version of Pl@ntNet released in January 2019 includes many improvements and new features:\n-The ability to filter recognized species by genus or family.\n-The differentiated data revision that gives more weight to users who have demonstrated the most skills (in particular the number of species observed, validated by the community).\n-The re-identification of shared observations, whether yours or those of other users of the application.\n-The multi-flora identification that allows you to search for the photographed plant in all the flora of the application and not only in the one you have selected. Very useful when you are not sure what flora to look for.\n-The selection of your favorite floras to access them more quickly.\n-The navigation at different taxonomic levels in image galleries.\n-The mapping of your observations.\n-Links to many factsheets.\n\nThe web version of the application is also available at the following address: https://identify.plantnet.org/"

It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organized.\n\nStudents can keep track of what’s due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and grades right in Classroom.\n\nWith the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and grade the assignment - at school or on the go.

Los docentes y los estudiantes utilizan Handing, para compartir información, recursos y conversaciones de interés común dentro y fuera del aula.\n\n¿Qué tipo de acciones puedo realizar en Handing?\nLa escuela (directivos-docentes-personal no docente) y la familia (padres-estudiantes) pueden producir, enviar, recibir y gestionar desde un único lugar, toda la información que comparten habitualmente a través del cuaderno de comunicaciones, las notas impresas, el website institucional, el correo electrónico, el teléfono, el chat y el aula virtual. En resumen, Handing permite a cada miembro de la comunidad, respetando su rol y cargo dentro de la institución, difundir novedades, anuncios y alertas, compartir documentos, imágenes, videos y enlaces. Solicitar y recibir documentos en línea. Coordinar y organizar eventos, asignar tareas y conversar en tiempo real, entre otras. \n\n¿La información es privada y segura?\n¡Siempre! Las comunicaciones en Handing son accesibles únicamente por las personas que pertenecen a una comunidad y que cuentan con los permisos adecuados. En relación a los niveles de privacidad, la información dentro de una comunidad puede ser: pública, si se la comparte con todo un nivel educativo; semi pública, si el mensaje se intercambia únicamente entre los miembros de un determinado grupo; y privada, si la conversación es uno a uno. En Handing, ninguna publicación se elimina, todas cuentan con la fecha, la hora y la persona que las publicó.\n\n¿Mejorará la comunicación con nuestras familias?\n¡Por supuesto! Handing fue diseñada específicamente para simplificar y mejorar el proceso de comunicación escuela-familia, facilitando la tarea del personal de la institución e incluyendo de manera simple, ágil e intuitiva, a todos los padres en la vida escolar de sus hijos. En Handing, cada padre recibe únicamente la información importante que necesita e involucra a sus hijos, de manera organizada, segura, en tiempo y forma. Además, para ayudarlos a organizarse mejor, Handing funciona como un asistente virtual que a través de notificaciones y recordatorios hace que toda la comunidad esté siempre \"en la misma página”.\n\n¿Mejorará la comunicación con las escuelas de nuestros hijos?\n¡Si y mucho! Handing fue creada por padres para padres que aman a sus hijos, les interesa su educación y quieren lo mejor para ellos. Y por supuesto, también para instituciones educativas que creen que el trabajo en equipo y la buena comunicación entre la escuela y la familia es un factor clave para el buen desarrollo académico y personal del nuestros niños y jóvenes.\nPor lo tanto, la comunicación colaborativa y fluida entre la institución escuela y la institución familia, es una actividad cotidiana que se practica y potencia con el uso de una herramienta que fue ideada desde la lógica de la escucha activa, la responsabilidad individual, la participación, el compromiso, la generación de vínculos positivos, la confianza, la organización y el trabajo en equipo."

Explorer is automatically set to the language of your device.\n \nMap and Turn-by-Turn Directions\nGet directions to exhibits and amenities, including shortest and accessible routes.\n \nGet Recommendations for What to See\nExplorer recommends exhibits based on interests you select—and sorts them by how close they are to your location.\n \nLearn More About the Museum’s Exhibits \nGo behind the scenes and dive deeper with videos, fun quizzes, and more.\n \nFind the Nearest Restroom \nExplorer provides you the shortest route to restrooms, shops, exits, and more.\n\nHow does Explorer know where you are? The Museum has placed more than 700 Bluetooth beacons throughout its 45 permanent halls. These tiny beacons give off signals that your phone can detect (when Bluetooth is enabled). Your phone calculates your position based on detecting three of these beacons simultaneously. This triangulation is not always perfect, especially in certain areas like large, multi-level halls, meandering walkways, or stairwells. Your phone should be able to detect the hall that you are in and provide turn-by-turn directions, but sometimes the “blue dot” is not exactly in the right place. In some rare cases it will even be missing. Moving to another area and waiting a few moments will usually fix the issue.\n\nThe Museum’s free AMNH-GUEST Wi-Fi also varies in strength throughout the complex. Certain materials and large exhibits (i.e. the Blue Whale) either absorb or reflect the radio signals used by Wi-Fi, further complicating this technology. If you experience difficulty connecting to Wi-Fi in a particular part of the Museum, you can usually fix the issue by moving a short distance away.\n \nWe’d Love to Hear From You!\nYour feedback is important and will help us improve your Museum experience.

      "label": "Welcome to \"Lila's World\" \n\nPlay as Lila while she visits her Grandma's house for the summer. There are a lot of things to discover all throughout this mystery manor in which Grandma lives. Explore the house, read a book in the library or have a tea party in the living room. Play the piano in the Music room or Cook almost any dish you can think of in the Kitchen. While you explore, don’t forget to look for the many secrets of the house. Now what could Grandma be hiding?\n\nNot only can you play in Grandma's house but you can draw and create your own worlds too. Use real paper and colors to draw new characters, scenes, food, objects and a lot more. \n\nBrowse all the different worlds created by all the imaginative kids out there. The possibilities are endless. \n\nMaybe you can help Lila setup her cousin Ro's birthday party, or go to the park for a picnic with her friends. \n\nMaybe you can sail the oceans on a pirate ship, or just have fun day at the beach with your family.\n\nYou can also play with your own drawn characters in the real world in the AR mode. Just watch as your own drawings come to life. It’s like Magic!\n\nMake your own pretend play world!\n\nPLAY:\nIn “Lila’s Word” there are no rules and no goals. Playing is as easy as tapping and dragging the characters to move them around so that different real world situations can be recreated. Most objects can be dragged around and moved in the scenes. Some items can be tapped to perform different specific actions like turning a light bulb ON and OFF or opening doors to go to other rooms. Make sure to check the Kitchen to find the hundreds of recipes. Just combining one ingredient with another can make new dishes like adding bread and cheese will create a cheese sandwich. However,  there are a few more complicated recipes which can be created by combining multiple ingredients in the oven and turning it ON. Be careful though, if they don’t combine well together, you will get a burnt dish… Yuck! Exploring is key in Lila’s world so make sure you check all the different areas of the game. There are many secrets hidden all around Grandma’s house so the more you explore, the more you will find. \n  \nCREATE - DRAWING and COLORING:\nOne of the most unique aspects of our game is the Create section. Here, users are encouraged to create their own scenes. Use the Create button to add your own items into the game. If you want your favorite toy in the game just make a drawing of it, take a picture from the Create menu and you can have it right in the game with you. Your favorite meal is not in the game? No problem, make a drawing of it and add it in yourself. Do you want to enter the game yourself? No problem, just make a drawing of yourself and enter the game directly. Maybe you want a different scene to play in but you don’t want to draw it yourself. Also, coming soon is the ability to browse other people's scenes and download them too. Soon you will be able to share your scenes and visit your friends scenes too.\n\nLEARN:\nNew Scenes every month. Learn about the following:\n- Different festivals from around the world\n- New cities to explore\n- A trip down your neighborhood \n\nSAFE FOR KIDS:\n\"Lila's World\" is absolutely safe for kids. Even while we allow kids to play with other kid's creations from around the world, we make sure all our content is moderated and nothing is approved without getting approved first. We collect no personal information and your can play completely offline if you want as well.\n\nYou can find our Terms of Use here:\nhttps://photontadpole.com/terms-and-conditions-lila-s-world\n\nYou can find our Privacy Policy here:\nhttps://photontadpole.com/privacy-policy-lila-s-world\n\nThis App has No Ads or no Social Media links.\n\nIf you have any questions, you can email us at support@photontadpole.com"

      "label": "Tracing Projector is your personal portable drawing and composition tool.\n\nHaving Tracing Projector is like always having a sheet of tracing paper with you! Choose any image you'd like to draw, take a photo, or choose from hundreds of images supplied in the app; then look at your screen while you trace the image on paper!\n\n- Learn to Draw! Learn proportions and important lines by tracing photos of anything! Use several filters to enhance your photo, making it easier to trace.\n\n- Make real one-of-a-kind artwork you can hang on your wall! Send unique greetings on social media! Friends and family will love to see your animated drawings!\n\n- Show off your skills! Record a video while you draw and share it on your favorite social network. Your friends will be amazed! Choose from time-lapse and regular speeds, and include a narrative if you want to. \n\n- Great for face painting or artistic makeup!\n\n- Great for school projects! Need to draw an image from a book on a poster? Trace it!\n\n- Kick-start your painting or portrait! Transfer your idea from a photo to your drawing canvas to get the proportions right.\n\n- Match the Composition! Transfer your plan from a sketch to the scrapbook page or photo wall! \n\n- Challenge yourself to sketch the essence of the image before the timer runs out! Focus on composition and structure. Freehand the fine details afterward, or disable Quick Sketch and trace them directly. (Disabling requires a one-time purchase.)\n\nSeveral tools make it really easy to trace your image:\n\n- Light Table - lock your screen, turn up the brightness, and trace the image from your screen directly!\n\n- Handheld Mode -- On supported devices, Augmented Reality keeps your tracing image steady while you hold your device at a comfortable angle. (demo video https://youtu.be/YJeK5Sjdi1Q). Requires iOS 11.3 or later on iPhone 6s/6s Plus or iPad Pro and later. Works best on stable horizontal and vertical surfaces with good light and some visible surface detail.\n\n- Lock the camera focus to keep the image steady while you trace.\n\n- Lock the canvas area to keep your layout and alignment while you zoom in to get a close look at your work in progress.\n\n- Several Filter modes enhance your image, increasing contrast to give you a better result.\n\n- Use the flashlight to light up your drawing. (requires Full Version)\n\n- Use the selfie camera and draw on your face. (requires Full Version)\n\n\nOther features make it fun and easy to share your creations with your friends.\n\n- Video recording in Time Lapse mode to make things smaller and faster and cooler. You can enable normal-speed and audio on the Settings screen.\n\n- The recorded video or snapshot includes a small thumbnail of the tracing image (with an option to turn that off).\n\n- Your videos and snapshots are stored automatically and available to share later from within the app, the Files app, or iTunes.\n\n- Sharing your videos and photos is easy with a preview screen and saved photos/videos!\n\n- Interrupted while recording your drawing? No problem - Combine multiple videos to create a single video for sharing! Use the Edit feature on the Saved Files screen: select two movies and tap Join.\n\n\nTracing Projector is Enhanced For 3D Touch! Start right away from the camera or photo album from the home screen! Force-touch on the tracing image to peek at your progress while you draw!\n\n\nNotes:\n- For best results, stabilize your device above your drawing surface. A stack of books, drinking glass, or tripod works best.\n- The app requires access to your camera in order to present its overlay for drawing.\n- The app requires access to your photos in order to load an image to trace and to save the video of your drawing.\n- The app optionally uses your microphone when recording a video while you draw."

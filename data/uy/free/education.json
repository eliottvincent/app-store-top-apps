      "label": "Pl@ntNet is an application that allows you to identify plants simply by photographing them with your smartphone. Very useful when you don't have a botanist on hand!\n\nPl@ntNet is also a great citizen science project: all the plants you photograph are collected and analysed by scientists around the world to better understand the evolution of plant biodiversity and to better preserve it.\n\nPl@ntNet allows you to identify and better understand all kinds of plants living in nature: flowering plants, trees, grasses, conifers, ferns, vines, wild salads, cacti (and many more). \n\nPl@ntNet can also identify a large number of cultivated plants (in parks and gardens) but this is not its primary purpose. We especially need Pl@ntNet’s users to inventory the wild plants, those that you can observe in nature, but also those that grow on the sidewalks of cities or in the middle of your vegetable garden!\n\nThe more visual information you give to Pl@ntNet about the plant you are observing, the more accurate the identification will be. There are indeed many plants that look alike from afar and it is sometimes small details that distinguish two species of the same genus. \n\nFlowers, fruits and leaves are the most characteristic organs of a species and it is them that should be photographed first. But any other detail can be useful, such as thorns, buds or hair on the stem. A photograph of the whole plant is also very useful information, but it is often not sufficient to allow a reliable identification.\n\nAt present, Pl@ntNet makes it possible to recognize about 20,000 species. We are still a long way from the 360,000 species living on earth, but Pl@ntNet is getting richer every day thanks to the contributions of the most experienced users among you. \n\nDon't be afraid to contribute yourself! Your observation will be reviewed by the community and may one day join the photo gallery illustrating the species in the application.\n\nThe new version of Pl@ntNet released in January 2019 includes many improvements and new features:\n-The ability to filter recognized species by genus or family.\n-The differentiated data revision that gives more weight to users who have demonstrated the most skills (in particular the number of species observed, validated by the community).\n-The re-identification of shared observations, whether yours or those of other users of the application.\n-The multi-flora identification that allows you to search for the photographed plant in all the flora of the application and not only in the one you have selected. Very useful when you are not sure what flora to look for.\n-The selection of your favorite floras to access them more quickly.\n-The navigation at different taxonomic levels in image galleries.\n-The mapping of your observations.\n-Links to many factsheets.\n\nThe web version of the application is also available at the following address: https://identify.plantnet.org/"

We will continue in the hopes that there will soon be peace for our children and children all around the world!\n\nDrawing Academy from Bini Games is a unique app where kids are inspired to learn by drawing. In our app, drawing gets children excited even for letters and numbers!\n\nIn preschoolers, drawing plays an important role in the development of the right side of the brain. As they draw, children process information in multiple ways, such as with their eyes and body, as well as emotionally. We created the Drawing Academy app with all this in mind.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n- 150 step-by step drawing tutorials in 10 thematic sets with different complexity levels for kids aged 2 to 6\n- “ABC\" and \"Numbers” packs to get children interested in learning letters and numbers through drawing with pictures they make themselves\n- a huge variety of tools, including pencils, crayons, stickers, patterns, and paints\n- tracing and free-drawing mechanics to help prepare your child’s hand for writing with step-by-step motor-skill refinement, from the moment they first scribble to their finalized masterpieces\n- activities that form a customized age-based learning program, taking your child’s interests into account\n- unique easy-to-follow tracing exercises that guide your child’s creativity without limitations and stimulating free drawing\n\nDrawing Academy isn’t just another coloring book!\n\nNote: only part of the content in the screenshots is available in the free version of the application. To gain access to the full version, you will need to make an in-app purchase.\n\nSubscription Details\n\nGet access to over 100 cute characters and drawings after subscribing to the Drawing Academy. Just download and go!\n\nA free 7-day trial period is available to you, or you can subscribe right after download.\n\nAfter your free trial, your subscription will automatically start unless you adjust your subscription settings at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.\n\nWe provide different subscription options for your convenience: monthly and annual subscription.\n\nIf you change your mind at any point, cancellation is easy through your iTunes settings.\n\nPayment for subscriptions will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\n\nYour subscription automatically renews unless you turn the renewal feature off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.\n\nYou will be charged for renewal within 24 hours of the end of the current period.\n\nYou can cancel your subscription anytime through your Account Settings without any cancellation fees.\n\nYou can use your subscription on any device registered with your Apple ID.\n\nIf you need help, have questions, or just want to say, “hi!”, get in touch at feedback@bini.games.\n\nhttps://binibambini.com/terms-of-use/\n\nhttp://binibambini.com/privacy\n\nMore about Bini Games:\n\nBini Games is a group of enthusiastic professionals including designers, artists, animators, programmers, and musicians, who love to create digital games for children.\n\nAll our games are safe and do not collect any personal information."

      "label": "¿Qué es Handing?\nHanding es una innovadora plataforma de comunicación institucional e involucramiento parental que conecta a la escuela y a la familia, como nunca habían estado. \n\nNuestra innovadora configuración, sumada a la mensajería bidireccional, la participación en línea y una interfaz de usuario fácil de usar e intuitiva, asegura que los procesos de comunicación, coordinación y colaboración entre todos los miembros de una comunidad educativa sean mucho más ágiles, eficientes y efectivos en comparación con los tradicionales medios de comunicación escolar (website, e-mail, cuaderno de comunicados, newsletters, blogs, fotocopias, aulas virtuales, SMS y sistemas de gestión académica). \n\n¿Quiénes utilizan Handing?\nTodos los adultos (educadores y padres de familia) que forman parte de una comunidad educativa, utilizan Handing para comunicarse diariamente entre sí, mantenerse siempre informados, en contacto y mejor organizados. Los docentes y los estudiantes utilizan Handing, para compartir información, recursos y conversaciones de interés común dentro y fuera del aula.\n\n¿Qué tipo de acciones puedo realizar en Handing?\nLa escuela (directivos-docentes-personal no docente) y la familia (padres-estudiantes) pueden producir, enviar, recibir y gestionar desde un único lugar, toda la información que comparten habitualmente a través del cuaderno de comunicaciones, las notas impresas, el website institucional, el correo electrónico, el teléfono, el chat y el aula virtual. En resumen, Handing permite a cada miembro de la comunidad, respetando su rol y cargo dentro de la institución, difundir novedades, anuncios y alertas, compartir documentos, imágenes, videos y enlaces. Solicitar y recibir documentos en línea. Coordinar y organizar eventos, asignar tareas y conversar en tiempo real, entre otras. \n\n¿La información es privada y segura?\n¡Siempre! Las comunicaciones en Handing son accesibles únicamente por las personas que pertenecen a una comunidad y que cuentan con los permisos adecuados. En relación a los niveles de privacidad, la información dentro de una comunidad puede ser: pública, si se la comparte con todo un nivel educativo; semi pública, si el mensaje se intercambia únicamente entre los miembros de un determinado grupo; y privada, si la conversación es uno a uno. En Handing, ninguna publicación se elimina, todas cuentan con la fecha, la hora y la persona que las publicó.\n\n¿Mejorará la comunicación con nuestras familias?\n¡Por supuesto! Handing fue diseñada específicamente para simplificar y mejorar el proceso de comunicación escuela-familia, facilitando la tarea del personal de la institución e incluyendo de manera simple, ágil e intuitiva, a todos los padres en la vida escolar de sus hijos. En Handing, cada padre recibe únicamente la información importante que necesita e involucra a sus hijos, de manera organizada, segura, en tiempo y forma. Además, para ayudarlos a organizarse mejor, Handing funciona como un asistente virtual que a través de notificaciones y recordatorios hace que toda la comunidad esté siempre \"en la misma página”.\n\n¿Mejorará la comunicación con las escuelas de nuestros hijos?\n¡Si y mucho! Handing fue creada por padres para padres que aman a sus hijos, les interesa su educación y quieren lo mejor para ellos. Y por supuesto, también para instituciones educativas que creen que el trabajo en equipo y la buena comunicación entre la escuela y la familia es un factor clave para el buen desarrollo académico y personal del nuestros niños y jóvenes.\nPor lo tanto, la comunicación colaborativa y fluida entre la institución escuela y la institución familia, es una actividad cotidiana que se practica y potencia con el uso de una herramienta que fue ideada desde la lógica de la escucha activa, la responsabilidad individual, la participación, el compromiso, la generación de vínculos positivos, la confianza, la organización y el trabajo en equipo."

      "label": "¿Qué es Handing?\nHanding es una innovadora plataforma de comunicación institucional e involucramiento parental que conecta a la escuela y a la familia, como nunca habían estado. \n\nNuestra innovadora configuración, sumada a la mensajería bidireccional, la participación en línea y una interfaz de usuario fácil de usar e intuitiva, asegura que los procesos de comunicación, coordinación y colaboración entre todos los miembros de una comunidad educativa sean mucho más ágiles, eficientes y efectivos en comparación con los tradicionales medios de comunicación escolar (website, e-mail, cuaderno de comunicados, newsletters, blogs, fotocopias, aulas virtuales, SMS y sistemas de gestión académica). \n\n¿Quiénes utilizan Handing?\nTodos los adultos (educadores y padres de familia) que forman parte de una comunidad educativa, utilizan Handing para comunicarse diariamente entre sí, mantenerse siempre informados, en contacto y mejor organizados. Los docentes y los estudiantes utilizan Handing, para compartir información, recursos y conversaciones de interés común dentro y fuera del aula.\n\n¿Qué tipo de acciones puedo realizar en Handing?\nLa escuela (directivos-docentes-personal no docente) y la familia (padres-estudiantes) pueden producir, enviar, recibir y gestionar desde un único lugar, toda la información que comparten habitualmente a través del cuaderno de comunicaciones, las notas impresas, el website institucional, el correo electrónico, el teléfono, el chat y el aula virtual. En resumen, Handing permite a cada miembro de la comunidad, respetando su rol y cargo dentro de la institución, difundir novedades, anuncios y alertas, compartir documentos, imágenes, videos y enlaces. Solicitar y recibir documentos en línea. Coordinar y organizar eventos, asignar tareas y conversar en tiempo real, entre otras. \n\n¿La información es privada y segura?\n¡Siempre! Las comunicaciones en Handing son accesibles únicamente por las personas que pertenecen a una comunidad y que cuentan con los permisos adecuados. En relación a los niveles de privacidad, la información dentro de una comunidad puede ser: pública, si se la comparte con todo un nivel educativo; semi pública, si el mensaje se intercambia únicamente entre los miembros de un determinado grupo; y privada, si la conversación es uno a uno. En Handing, ninguna publicación se elimina, todas cuentan con la fecha, la hora y la persona que las publicó.\n\n¿Mejorará la comunicación con nuestras familias?\n¡Por supuesto! Handing fue diseñada específicamente para simplificar y mejorar el proceso de comunicación escuela-familia, facilitando la tarea del personal de la institución e incluyendo de manera simple, ágil e intuitiva, a todos los padres en la vida escolar de sus hijos. En Handing, cada padre recibe únicamente la información importante que necesita e involucra a sus hijos, de manera organizada, segura, en tiempo y forma. Además, para ayudarlos a organizarse mejor, Handing funciona como un asistente virtual que a través de notificaciones y recordatorios hace que toda la comunidad esté siempre \"en la misma página”.\n\n¿Mejorará la comunicación con las escuelas de nuestros hijos?\n¡Si y mucho! Handing fue creada por padres para padres que aman a sus hijos, les interesa su educación y quieren lo mejor para ellos. Y por supuesto, también para instituciones educativas que creen que el trabajo en equipo y la buena comunicación entre la escuela y la familia es un factor clave para el buen desarrollo académico y personal del nuestros niños y jóvenes.\nPor lo tanto, la comunicación colaborativa y fluida entre la institución escuela y la institución familia, es una actividad cotidiana que se practica y potencia con el uso de una herramienta que fue ideada desde la lógica de la escucha activa, la responsabilidad individual, la participación, el compromiso, la generación de vínculos positivos, la confianza, la organización y el trabajo en equipo."

      "label": "Pl@ntNet is an application that allows you to identify plants simply by photographing them with your smartphone. Very useful when you don't have a botanist on hand!\n\nPl@ntNet is also a great citizen science project: all the plants you photograph are collected and analysed by scientists around the world to better understand the evolution of plant biodiversity and to better preserve it.\n\nPl@ntNet allows you to identify and better understand all kinds of plants living in nature: flowering plants, trees, grasses, conifers, ferns, vines, wild salads, cacti (and many more). \n\nPl@ntNet can also identify a large number of cultivated plants (in parks and gardens) but this is not its primary purpose. We especially need Pl@ntNet’s users to inventory the wild plants, those that you can observe in nature, but also those that grow on the sidewalks of cities or in the middle of your vegetable garden!\n\nThe more visual information you give to Pl@ntNet about the plant you are observing, the more accurate the identification will be. There are indeed many plants that look alike from afar and it is sometimes small details that distinguish two species of the same genus. \n\nFlowers, fruits and leaves are the most characteristic organs of a species and it is them that should be photographed first. But any other detail can be useful, such as thorns, buds or hair on the stem. A photograph of the whole plant is also very useful information, but it is often not sufficient to allow a reliable identification.\n\nAt present, Pl@ntNet makes it possible to recognize about 20,000 species. We are still a long way from the 360,000 species living on earth, but Pl@ntNet is getting richer every day thanks to the contributions of the most experienced users among you. \n\nDon't be afraid to contribute yourself! Your observation will be reviewed by the community and may one day join the photo gallery illustrating the species in the application.\n\nThe new version of Pl@ntNet released in January 2019 includes many improvements and new features:\n-The ability to filter recognized species by genus or family.\n-The differentiated data revision that gives more weight to users who have demonstrated the most skills (in particular the number of species observed, validated by the community).\n-The re-identification of shared observations, whether yours or those of other users of the application.\n-The multi-flora identification that allows you to search for the photographed plant in all the flora of the application and not only in the one you have selected. Very useful when you are not sure what flora to look for.\n-The selection of your favorite floras to access them more quickly.\n-The navigation at different taxonomic levels in image galleries.\n-The mapping of your observations.\n-Links to many factsheets.\n\nThe web version of the application is also available at the following address: https://identify.plantnet.org/"

We will continue in the hopes that there will soon be peace for our children and children all around the world!\n\nDrawing Academy from Bini Games (ex-Bini Bambini) is a unique app where kids are inspired to learn by drawing. In our app, drawing gets children excited even for letters and numbers!\n\nIn preschoolers, drawing plays an important role in the development of the right side of the brain. As they draw, children process information in multiple ways, such as with their eyes and body, as well as emotionally. We created the Drawing Academy app with all this in mind.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n- 150 step-by step drawing tutorials in 10 thematic sets with different complexity levels for kids aged 2 to 6\n- “ABC\" and \"Numbers” packs to get children interested in learning letters and numbers through drawing with pictures they make themselves\n- a huge variety of tools, including pencils, crayons, stickers, patterns, and paints\n- tracing and free-drawing mechanics to help prepare your child’s hand for writing with step-by-step motor-skill refinement, from the moment they first scribble to their finalized masterpieces\n- activities that form a customized age-based learning program, taking your child’s interests into account\n- unique easy-to-follow tracing exercises that guide your child’s creativity without limitations and stimulating free drawing\n\nDrawing Academy isn’t just another coloring book!\n\nNote: only part of the content in the screenshots is available in the free version of the application. To gain access to the full version, you will need to make an in-app purchase.\n\nSubscription Details\n\nGet access to over 100 cute characters and drawings after subscribing to the Drawing Academy. Just download and go!\n\nA free 7-day trial period is available to you, or you can subscribe right after download.\n\nAfter your free trial, your subscription will automatically start unless you adjust your subscription settings at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.\n\nWe provide different subscription options for your convenience: monthly and annual subscription.\n\nIf you change your mind at any point, cancellation is easy through your iTunes settings.\n\nPayment for subscriptions will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\n\nYour subscription automatically renews unless you turn the renewal feature off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.\n\nYou will be charged for renewal within 24 hours of the end of the current period.\n\nYou can cancel your subscription anytime through your Account Settings without any cancellation fees.\n\nYou can use your subscription on any device registered with your Apple ID.\n\nABOUT BINI GAMES \n\nBini Games (ex-Bini Bambini) was started in 2012 by four parents with experience in children's education.

Classroom makes it easy for learners and instructors to connect—inside and outside of schools. Classroom saves time and paper, and makes it easy to create classes, distribute assignments, communicate, and stay organized.\n\nClassroom is designed to help teachers create, collect, and grade assignments paperlessly, including time-saving features like the ability to automatically make a copy of a Google Document for each student. It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organized.\n\nStudents can keep track of what’s due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and grades right in Classroom.\n\nWith the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and grade the assignment - at school or on the go. Students and teachers receive notifications when they have new content in Classroom, so they are always up to date.\n\nThere are many benefits of using Classroom:\n\nEasy to set up\nTeachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It takes just minutes to set up.\n\nSaves time\nThe simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review, and grade assignments quickly, all in one place.\n\nImproves organization\nStudents can see all of their assignments on an assignments page, and all class materials (e.g., documents, photos, and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.\n\nEnhances communication\nClassroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.\n\nSecure\nLike the rest of Google Workspace for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes.\n\nPermissions Notice:\nCamera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.\nMicrophone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.\nPhotos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom. Photos or videos posted to Classroom will be stored on Google servers in order to show them in Classroom."

Just watch as your own drawings come to life. It’s like Magic!\n\nMake your own pretend play world!\n\nPLAY:\nIn “Lila’s Word” there are no rules and no goals. Playing is as easy as tapping and dragging the characters to move them around so that different real world situations can be recreated. Most objects can be dragged around and moved in the scenes. Some items can be tapped to perform different specific actions like turning a light bulb ON and OFF or opening doors to go to other rooms. Make sure to check the Kitchen to find the hundreds of recipes. Just combining one ingredient with another can make new dishes like adding bread and cheese will create a cheese sandwich. However,  there are a few more complicated recipes which can be created by combining multiple ingredients in the oven and turning it ON. Be careful though, if they don’t combine well together, you will get a burnt dish… Yuck! Exploring is key in Lila’s world so make sure you check all the different areas of the game. There are many secrets hidden all around Grandma’s house so the more you explore, the more you will find. \n  \nCREATE - DRAWING and COLORING:\nOne of the most unique aspects of our game is the Create section. Here, users are encouraged to create their own scenes. Use the Create button to add your own items into the game. If you want your favorite toy in the game just make a drawing of it, take a picture from the Create menu and you can have it right in the game with you. Your favorite meal is not in the game? No problem, make a drawing of it and add it in yourself. Do you want to enter the game yourself? No problem, just make a drawing of yourself and enter the game directly. Maybe you want a different scene to play in but you don’t want to draw it yourself. Also, coming soon is the ability to browse other people's scenes and download them too. Soon you will be able to share your scenes and visit your friends scenes too.\n\nLEARN:\nNew Scenes every month. Learn about the following:\n- Different festivals from around the world\n- New cities to explore\n- A trip down your neighborhood \n\nSAFE FOR KIDS:\n\"Lila's World\" is absolutely safe for kids. Even while we allow kids to play with other kid's creations from around the world, we make sure all our content is moderated and nothing is approved without getting approved first. We collect no personal information and your can play completely offline if you want as well.\n\nYou can find our Terms of Use here:\nhttps://photontadpole.com/terms-and-conditions-lila-s-world\n\nYou can find our Privacy Policy here:\nhttps://photontadpole.com/privacy-policy-lila-s-world\n\nThis App has No Ads or no Social Media links.\n\nIf you have any questions, you can email us at support@photontadpole.com"

      "label": "Math can be fun. For everyone. From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

It‘s a magical, fairy tale inspired adventure into an island filled with fantasy characters, magic spells and royal fun!\n\nCREATIVE PLAY\n \nThis is the most magical Pepi game so far and by that we mean fantastic spells, adventurous knights, dancing horses and baby dragons. Its positively insane and highly inspirational, cause the game is all about the fairy tales we love so much! Imagine a dollhouse or a sandbox filled with toys to the brim.

Even though we dive into fantasy worlds we remain true to our core values and education through moderation. Pepi Wonder World Lite is best when its played together. Ask kids to create their own fairy tales and use the game as a digital stage. Dozens of characters and hundreds of usable items is a perfect opportunity to learn new words, storytelling and just a little bit of acting through roleplay.\n\nCURIOSITY... GAVE CAT BOOTS!\n\nWe all know that saying, but in our games curiosity and exploration is the key! With every new game in our dollhouse series, we are increasing the number of items, animations, and possible combinations. We encourage kids to be brave in their explorations, thus we have even more hidden items, secret areas and cheeky puzzles in our kingdom this time. The most amazing thing about this? Well, we‘re looking to add more fairy tale worlds to our game, so in the future, your characters will be able to board the ship and travel to the Dwarf Island, where new adventures await! \n\nKEY FEATURES\n\n• 30+ new characters including knights, princess‘es, baby dragons and ghosts!\n• Loaded with animations and interactions — use musical instruments, craft items, shoot bows, have crazy, medieval fun! \n• Proper fairy tale world, filled with enchanting spells, secrets and surprises!\n• Find the hidden keys and explore secret rooms to find even more toys to play with.\n• Use, mix and match any item and equipment You can find and get surprising results!\n• Different scenes. Behold the magic Kingdom — from shiny throne rooms, to darkest dungeons!  \n• King‘s kitchen: cook like there‘s a kingdom to feed, dine like kings and queens! \n• Play together, game supports multitouch!\n• Dedicated for 3-7-year-old kids, but will bring joy for the whole family."

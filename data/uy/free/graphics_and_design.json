Capture and detect colors simply by pointing the camera at the object. The app identifies the color name and color code of the selected area on the screen.\n\n– Color Palette Generator. The application algorithm creates harmonious color palettes and you can adjust color values to your liking. Or you can generate a color palette that complements any color you input.\n\n– Color Harmonies. For each color you collect, the app creates color combinations that go well with a base color (based on color theory and color wheel harmonies). Grab a pre-defined color palette and adjust color values to your liking.\n \nAre you colorblind, unable to distinguish certain color hues, or simply want to know What color is it? It is a simple-to-use app for identifying colors for you!\n \nEasily save, share, duplicate, remove and edit already saved palettes. The app supports the most common color models as RGB, HEX, LAB, HSV, HSL, CMYK and color formats – .PNG, .SVG, .ACO, .ASE, .GPL.\n \nWhether you’re creating visual graphics, painting digitally, designing logos or interfaces, trying to match the brand color theme – being able to select the right color or palette quickly is important. Color Picker AR is a helpful all-in-one color tool for any artist that works with color palettes."

Frax is powered by fractal geometry, the same principle that creates patterns of self-similarity in our natural world.  From spiral galaxies to hurricanes, from tree limbs to branching blood vessels, the universe is filled with endless variation and staggering beauty.  Frax visualizes this natural geometric code, so you can explore vast animating digital landscapes and make a masterpiece on your touchscreen.\n\nEXPLORE\nZoom deep into your creations. Use multi-touch gestures to fly through and explore intricate shapes and patterns. Tilt-to-steer through animating digital worlds, as you challenge yourself to chart a course for a long and beautiful flight –all at a depth range of a trillion-to-one.\n\nDESIGN\nUnleash your inner artist with complex color gradients to smoothly tint and shade your fractal shapes, two light sources for glossy reflections, and novel textures.  The combinations are endless: supersmooth or wildly chaotic, metallic sheen or pearly white, subtle shades, stark monochrome or screaming supergloss. Or upgrade to Pro to access almost 100 parameters and controls!\n\nSHARE\nThen share your creations with your friends via Facebook, Twitter and text.  Or invite other users to step into your animating world by sharing a live preset link.  You can render high-quality images to your photo library or create ultra-high quality 200 Megapixel renders with an IAP. And for the first time, you can now record VIDEO of your Frax animations directly within the app! (Pro IAP required.) Our users have put their designs on canvas, posters, scarves, T-shirts and textiles. The creative possibilities are endless!\n\nWhat will Frax inspire in you?\n\nWe hope you enjoy Frax!\nBen Weiss • Kai Krause • Tom Beddard"

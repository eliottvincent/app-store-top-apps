Like the profiles that catch your eye, get a Crush and most importantly, get together!\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\n\nWhen you cross paths with another happn user, their profile appears on your app.\nDid someone catch your eye? Like them secretly. We promise, the person will never know, unless they Like you back. Do you want to stand out? Send them a FlashNote. Now you can send a message before you even get a Crush. And if the Like is mutual, then the Crush is yours! Now you can chat or set up a video call, and we’re counting on you to make that first message memorable.

And now, we’ve been named one of Apple’s 2021 Apps of the Year for connection.\nCreating new connections has never been easier. Bumble is working to lift the stigma of online dating by employing unprecedented standards for respectful behavior. Because of this relentless dedication, millions of people are using Bumble to build valuable relationships every single day.\n\nDATING, FRIENDS & NETWORKING\n\nBumble is at the forefront of matchmaking technology by providing an app that allows users to foster more than just romantic connections. The industry-leading app empowers users to swipe through potential connections across three different modes:\n\n- Bumble Date: On Bumble Date, women make the first move. We’ve changed the archaic rules of the dating game so that you can form meaningful relationships in a respectful way.\n\n- Bumble BFF: Life is better with friends. Whether you’re new to a city or looking to expand your circle, Bumble BFF is the easiest way to make new friends.\n\n- Bumble Bizz: Now we’re in business. Use Bumble Bizz to network, find mentors, and create new career opportunities.\n\n\nBumble is the first app of its kind to bring dating, friend-finding, and career-building into a single social networking platform.\n\nCHANGING THE RULES OF THE GAME\n\nAt Bumble, women make the first move. In heterosexual matches, the woman has 24 hours to make the first move and the man has 24 hours to respond. In same-sex matches, either person has 24 hours to make the first move, while the other individual has 24 hours to respond, or else, the connection expires. By prompting our users to be bold and make the first move we’ve seen over 3 billion messages sent to date.\n\nTHE BUZZ IS REAL\n\n“Bumble exists to empower women...” (Fast Company)\n“Bumble is just an app: but it’s changing the discussion.” (Wired)\n“Bumble offers an alternative that prioritises meaningful connections, with women calling the shots:” (UK Sunday Times)\n“Bumble rejects hate speech to make users feel safe on its dating app” (Texas Standard)\n“What makes Bumble different from other dating apps...is its focus on giving women all the power. ” (Business Insider)\n\n---\n\nBumble is free to download and use. However, we also offer optional subscription packages (Bumble Premium and Bumble Boost) and single or multiple-use paid services for which no subscription is required (including Spotlights and SuperSwipes).\nWe offer weekly, monthly, 3 month and 6 month subscriptions giving discounts to the weekly price. The prices may vary per country and are subject to change without notice. Prices are clearly displayed in the app.\n\n* Payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase.\n* Your subscription will automatically renew itself, unless auto-renewal is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.\n* Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.\n* You can manage your subscriptions and turn off auto-renewal by going to your Account Settings in the iTunes Store.\n* If offered, if you choose to use our free trial, any unused portion of the free trial period will be forfeited when you purchase a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n* If you don’t choose to purchase Bumble Boost, you can simply continue using and enjoying Bumble for free.\n\nYour personal data is securely stored on Bumble - be sure to read our privacy policy and terms and conditions:\nhttps://www.bumble.com/privacy\nhttps://www.bumble.com/terms\n\nBumble Inc. is the parent company of Bumble, along with Badoo and Fruitz"

Even if your addiction is specific like Wine, Online Shopping, or Skin Picking, you’ll find a variety of communities of people who are all trying to get sober from alcohol, drugs, eating disorders, self-harm, and more.\n\nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. I Am Sober Plus automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and the cost of the renewal will be identified.

Here's a tip: You might not even need to buy a real CCTV camera, baby monitor, IP cam or IP webcam. \n\nBesides the cost of the equipment, these smart home appliances often charge a monthly fee. With security apps like Alfred, there is no complicated installation, IP settings, or contract. You only have to download Alfred to repurpose your old devices as a DIY WiFi Camera or baby monitor: pure and simple. \n\nThe best home surveillance camera you can ever find: Free, reliable, versatile and easy to use. No hidden upfront costs or astronomical monitoring fees.

So you’ll only be alerted if your baby is crying for example, instead of just turning around in their bed.\n\n\nIt really works - No matter how far you are from your baby, you will get an SMS or Video stream  as soon as cry is detected.\n\nDownload app on both iOS devices and connect to the same wi-fi network. Leave one device in baby’s room, camera facing to the child. Open the app on the second device and connect to child unit to watch your baby with live video monitor. \n\n\n\nIn case if battery goes low on the device, that is left with baby, you will receive special alert, to be more careful about it.\n\n\n\n\nYou don’t have to buy the Baby Monitor devices any more. Just download this free app in your iDevice and monitor your baby's sleep by receiving SMS or with Live video streaming. \n\nIt’s never been so easy!\n\nMain features of Baby Monitor:\n\n- Easy to set up.\n- Get warned even on 1st generation mobile phone.\n- Live video streaming of your baby's sleep\n- Switch On Flashlight from paired device if the light is weak in your baby's room\n- Opportunity to turn On lullabies and White Noise remotely \n\nSteps for setting up Phone Call mode is pretty simple:\n\n- Insert the contact number or add it from your phonebook\n- Check the Noise Level on the indicator and set up threshold accordingly\n- Choose Noise Duration \n- ON the Super function, that will alert you if the battery life is less than 25%\n\nStep for setting up Video Monitor much more easier:\n\n- Connect with another iOS device with Wi-Fi connection\n- Choose best place for Baby's unit \n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nNote:\n\n1. Keep the charger connected or turn ON \"Battery Life Alert\";\n\n2. We recommend \"Do Not Disturb\" mode to avoid incoming voice calls and alerts on Baby's Unit device;\n- Settings > Do Not Disturb > Manual - ON \n- Settings > Do Not Disturb > Allow Calls From - No One\n- Settings > Do Not Disturb > Repeated Calls - Disabled \n- Settings > Do Not Disturb > SILENCE - Always\n3. It’s important to keep app active, it's not functional in background mode;\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nYou can get Pro features through auto-renewing subscription and if you want to continue getting premium features, your subscription should be continued.\n\n3 Monthly subscription costs $4.99 (or equivalent) and renews automatically every three month, unless you cancel it through your iTunes  account\n\nPrices are in U.S. dollars, may vary in countries other than the U.S. and are subject to change with notice.\n\n\nPayment will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\n\n\nYour subscription automatically renews unless auto-renewal is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current subscription.\nYour account will be charged for a renewed subscription within 24 hours prior to the end of current subscription.\nYou can manage your subscription and switch off the auto-renewal by accessing your account settings after purchase.\nYou cannot cancel the current subscription during the active subscription period.\n\n\nAny unused part or time-span of a free trial period will be forfeited, as soon as you purchase a subscription.\n\n\nmore information can be found on the following links: Terms & Conditions: https://www.lemondo.com/BabyMonitorTerms.html\n\nPrivacy policy: http://lemondo.com/privacy\n\n\nWe want to hear your suggestions, likes, complains..

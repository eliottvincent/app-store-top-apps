Or in reverse: a string and fret are marked in red and you have to click the right note on the staff. This helps on being able to see a written note and relate it with the bass guitar fretboard or seeing an specific fretboard position and knowing which one is the corresponding note on the staff.\n\nThere are exercises without time limit to click and there are exercises with time limit to increase the speed to respond.\n\nMELODIC READING SECTION (30 exercises):\nThis section contains exercises to help you in reading notes on the Electric Bass, from a melodic point of view. Complex rhythmic values are not included here. The goal is to develop the ability to read the notes that may appear in a score in several key signatures and relate them to their position on the bass guitar fretboard: string and fret.\n\nWhen the exercise begins you have to click with your left hand fingers (on the virtual bass guitar fretboard) on the string and the fret corresponding to each one of the notes written, in real time. You get points for each correct click.\n\nRHYTHMIC READING SECTION (30 exercises):\nThis section contains exercises to practice reading the rhythmic values of notes. Melodic patterns of notes are not included here as the main objective is to become more able to read rhythmic values in several time signatures in music for Bass Guitar.\n\nWhen the exercise begins you have to click on the red rectangle (on the right lower side of the screen) when each one of the notes or silences marked in red take place in real time. You get points for each correct click.\n\nIn the same way as reading piano music, flute music, violin music or bass music, all require practice; reading Bass Guitar becomes easier if you practice it on a daily basis. This app allows you to practice anytime, anywhere.\n\nKnowing how to read music is very useful if you get Bass Guitar lessons. Being able to understand a music score helps you to get a better understanding of any type of Bass Guitar music styles."

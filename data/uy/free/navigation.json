      "label": "Turn your iPhone and iPad into a Speedometer with Speedometer One! Speedometer One is also suitable for cars, boats, motorcycles, or other types of vehicles. We have various features to make Speedometer the best speed tracker app for IOS devices. We use GPS to track your speed and alert you when you are over the speed limit. There are other features that will be useful for you such as Night Mode, HUD screen, and many more.  \n\nHave you ever driven a car and worried that you go over the speed limit? Driving too fast can get you into trouble especially if there are some traffic cops nearby with their speed radar gun. That’s why we add Speed Limit Alert as one of the most important features of our app. You can enable and disable it. We support US and EU style speed limit signs and support different display units. This means that it will make it easier to drive when you visit EU or USA. \n\nAside from tracking your speed, Speedometer one also can track your distance, altitude, average speed, and top speed. \n\n=== FEATURES OF SPEEDOMETER ONE: ===\n\n\t•\tAccurate Speedometer for Cars, Boats, Motorcycle or other types of Vehicles. \n\t•\tChoose your units mph, km/h, or knots. \n\t•\tSupport Night Mode with high contrast on the screen. \n\t•\tSupport Landscape or Portrait Mode.\n\t•\tSpeed Limit Alert: Enable this option first, and \n\t•\tHUD (Head Unit Display) Mode \n\t•\tSupports USA and EU speed limit. \n\t•\tChoose over 44 themes (22 dark and 22 light) through In-App Purchase. \n\nWhen you use the HUD mode, you can put your iPhone on the dashboard near the windshield. Our app is very customizable, especially if you’ve unlocked our themes. You can choose the look and display according to your needs: your mood, eyesight, night or day. Our customization is what sets us apart from other similar apps. Try it for yourself today!\n\nIMPORTANT USAGE NOTE: \n\n\t•\tTo be able to use Speedometer One, please allow Location Services.  \n\t•\tSet what kind of vehicle you use and the max speed before using. \n\t•\tSpeedometer One is not compatible with Wifi only iPad or iPod Touch. \n\t•\tOur speed tracker is based on GPS info. GPS sensor is not always accurate due to the device hardware sensor limitation. When in doubt, always rely on your car’s speedometer.\n\t•\tGPS is most accurate when you are in wide-open spaces. Trees, tall buildings, and other things might affect your GPS accuracy. \n\t•\tProlong use of GPS will affect your battery life. \n\t•\tPlease stay safe. Focus on the road ahead and do not interact with any device when you are driving, especially when you are driving at high speed.\n\nLove Speedometer One! Give it a rating and review on our Appstore page and don’t forget to share it with your friends and family! If you encounter a problem when using the app, please send us an email about it and we will work ASAP to fix it."

Navigate your city’s public transit system with accurate real-time predictions, simple trip planning, step-by-step navigation, service disruption notifications, and departure and stop reminders... all presented in a clear, bold interface. Public transport not cooperating? Easily request a ride from Uber, Lyft or VIA, or grab the closest bikeshare.  \n\n10 GREAT THINGS YOU CAN DO WITH TRANSIT:\n1) See real-time arrivals for nearby buses and trains instantly upon launch.\n2) Watch your transit vehicle approaching on a map in real-time\n3) Compare options with powerful A to B trip plans using real-time data.\n4) Launch GO for step-by-step navigation when you’re on an unfamiliar route or want to nap/read/space out.*\n5) Receive departure alarms and stop notifications as well as prompts to pick up the pace in GO.*\n6) Get push notifications if service disruptions will affect your commute.\n7) Plan trips, view transit schedules and get route itineraries—even when you’re offline! \n8) Locate bikeshare stations, see the number of bikes available, pay for passes, and unlock bikes (in select cities). \n9) Check ETA (and price) for nearby Uber, Lyft and VIA rides, and book in two taps.\n10) Easily plan and pay for a trip combining Uber, Lyft, or VIA with transit. We call it Transit+ \n\n*continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\n5-STAR USER REVIEWS\n“Your app was the deciding factor in selling my car”\n“Blows Google Maps out of the water.” \n\"Probably the best thing on my phone, no joke.\"\n“The head of our local transit agency recommended this app over the one her agency created.”\n\"Truly ingenious work here.

Colour coded icons make identification easy too.\n\nIf you like this app you'll love the full version of Ship Finder.\n\nThe full version includes a huge array of additional features including route history, search, filters, bookmarks, photos, the ability to add favourite ships and much more.\n\nShip Finder works by picking up AIS ship feeds used by all passenger vessels, vessels over 300 tons and increasingly by smaller pleasure craft and yachts. This technology is actually faster than radar and is used by vessels for safety and navigation.\n\nShip Finder provides near real time “virtual radar” AIS maps. It’s easy to use and is an amazing app for anyone interested in shipping, cruising and sailing in ports and locations across the world. It’s also great if you simply want to know what boats are out there or want to see where your friends and family are. Ship Finder is also used extensively by maritime professionals and mariners.\n\nOur global AIS coverage is impressive and expanding all of the time as we add new AIS feeds and receivers. Please check www.shipfinder.co regularly to see the latest coverage.\n\nPinkfroot are committed to customer service and continually improve our Ship Finder apps based on feedback. Why not join our online community at www.pinkfroot.com or if you have any questions please email us via support@pinkfroot.com and we’ll be happy to help. \n\nDisclaimer: Ship Finder should not be used for navigational purposes. \nUnder no circumstances will the developer of this application be held responsible for incidents resulting from the use of the data or its interpretation."

The connection is established wirelessly between a smartphone, the vehicle and – if available – a communication system via Bluetooth; the app is operated using the multi-controller on the handlebar. We recommend using the BMW Motorrad communication system for listening to music, making telephone calls and receiving navigation instructions.\r\n•\tA mobile Internet connection is required to access traffic information. This may incur costs in line with the contract between the customer and their mobile provider (e.g. for roaming).\r\n•\tPlease note that the functionality of your smartphone and the connection to the vehicle also depend on national requirements and factors; BMW Motorrad therefore cannot guarantee that it will be available at all times.\r\n•\tThe BMW Motorrad Connected app will be displayed in the language you have set for your smartphone. Please note that not all languages are supported.\r\n•\tContinued use of GPS tracking in the background may reduce the battery life of your smartphone.\r\nMake Life a Ride."

Only those receivers are compatible, which are officially supported by Apple. Due to the size of the package and certain In-App items, we recommend purchasing and downloading the application, In-App items or updates through WiFi or fixed line Internet access via the iTunes software installed on a personal computer.\n\nNote: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. Background navigation has to be turned on while using the application; you can do this under \"Settings / Advanced settings\" in iOS 7."

In the event of an incident, you’ll immediately have all the evidence you need to fight your case, all in your phone. You may even share access to your video with friends and family via the DriverCloud.\n \nWHY CHOOSE DRIVER:\nRecord your drives\nNo recording time limits!

Both video files are attached to each trip for easy and convenient viewing. The feature is available on iPhone XS/XR or newer.\n \nNever lose video data\nAlways find a backup video stored in the DriverCloud. Save storage on your iPhone by setting the Driver app to auto-delete videos after 1-30 days. Note that 1HR of single-cam HD recording takes up roughly one 1GB of storage.\n \nAccess videos instantly\nEasily access all your videos from your iPhone or any browser with DriverCloud.

The system will start calibrating at a speed threshold of about 20mph.\n\n \nTIPS:\n- Mount your phone on a dashboard phone holder (shorter ones provide greater video stability/use magnetic dash mounts for easy mounting)\n- For longer trips, keep your phones plugged into your charger (USB cable)\n- During hot summer days, avoid prolonged exposure to direct sunlight\n \nABOUT DRIVER:\nAt Driver, our mission is to make driving safer and smarter for everyone. The non-paid version of the DriverApp is ad-free and absolutely free.

      "label": "Designed with the user of public transport in mind, but without forgetting the drivers, MobiPalma is the ultimate app for moving around Palma and now fully accessible to blind people. Welcome to sustainable mobility!\n\n* Do you want to know when the next bus will arrive to your stop, or even get an automatic notification a few minutes before?\n* Or which is the best combination of buses to get to any point in the city?\n* Or how to swiftly move inside Palma combining buses and public bikes?\n* Or how to make sure that your BiciPalma trip closed correctly when you leave your bike in its anchor point?\n\nMobiPalma provides real-time, geolocated information on traffic conditions, the location and occupancy level of parking and public bicycle stations, in addition to all the information on the EMT Palma bus network. It's a free app and it's available in Catalán, Spanish, English and German.\n\nMobiPalma is jointly promoted by the Department of Mobility of Palma de Mallorca City Hall, Emt Palma and SMAP (which manages public parkings and Bicipalma).\n\nWith the MobiPalma app you will be able to:\n\n* Get bus arrival times exactly as in the EMT Palma app, but now also without knowing the bus stop number: choose your bus stop directly on the map; search directly by stop number, seeing the matches as you type; use the new text search engine for locating stops by street name. You can also get the bus arrival time from other screens of the app such as line information.\n\n* Calculate routes between a source and a destination using the bus network or using different combinations of bus, public bike and parkings. You can set the source and destination of the route by searching for street names or places: a hotel, a restaurant, a bar, a shop or a mall... And of course, you can select any point directly on a map of the city that shows your location.\n\n* Consult the information on all bus lines and all bus stops on the network.\n\n* View the closest stops to your location represented on the city map.\n\n\n* Schedule automatic reminders to be at the stop at the right time and don't miss the bus anymore.\n\n* Mark your usual bus stops as favorites and save them with a name for convenience.\n\n* Add to Favorites screen: bus lines, the combination of line and bus stop, Bicipalma bike stations, public car parks, urban road sections with data traffic congestion data and public traffic cameras.\n\n* Check at a glance the status of all your favorites by just opening the app (since \"Your Favorites\" is the initial screen), and even see the arrival time of your favorite stop-line combinations without touching the screen.\n\n* View on a map the congestion status of the main roads of the city.\n\n* Take a look at the live feed of various public traffic cameras.\n\n* Go with your car to a car park knowing in advance the number of available slots and compare the price with other nearby parking options.\n\n* Go to a BiciPalma bike station knowing in advance the number of available bikes and open anchor points, as well as any unusable ones.\n\n* Automatically receive a 25, 30 and 60 minutes after the bike caught push notification (provided it has not already been returned to an anchor.)\n\n* Check from within the app your Bicipalma usage history and, for example, make sure the trip closed correctly when you left the bike in its anchor point, or see any penalty for extra time.\n\n* Be informed of any incident in public roads and in the transport network, regardless of the sender: Town Hall, EMT Palma or SMAP. Notices on important incidents are sent as an automatic notification to your phone, and you can always disable it in the Settings screen."

We've also carefully designed FeedFinder so that it can be used one-handed as much as possible so that you can even be adding a review of a breastfeeding place as you breastfeed your little one.\n\nYou can use FeedFinder to find places around you where other mothers have had positive breastfeeding experiences. Every recommended place on the map will have been reviewed by someone who's breastfeeding. You'll be able to see not only how they have rated that place, but also any handy comments that they have added about their experience or the location, like whether they have toys and a menu for toddlers, or where the breastfeeding room is if it's a bit difficult to find.\n\nIf you can't find somewhere near you, or have found a new gem be sure to add the new place to the map. You'll find the process easy and convenient with FeedFinder doing most the hard work, like locating the place on the map, or adding the address details – all you'll need to do is add a star rating and your own comments. \n\nFeedFinder is part of a project by Open Lab Newcastle University, UK. Check out http://feed-finder.co.uk/ for more details."

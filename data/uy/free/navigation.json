This means that it will make it easier to drive when you visit EU or USA. \n\nAside from tracking your speed, Speedometer one also can track your distance, altitude, average speed, and top speed. \n\n=== FEATURES OF SPEEDOMETER ONE: ===\n\n\t•\tAccurate Speedometer for Cars, Boats, Motorcycle or other types of Vehicles. \n\t•\tChoose your units mph, km/h, or knots. \n\t•\tSupport Night Mode with high contrast on the screen. \n\t•\tSupport Landscape or Portrait Mode.\n\t•\tSpeed Limit Alert: Enable this option first, and \n\t•\tHUD (Head Unit Display) Mode \n\t•\tSupports USA and EU speed limit. \n\t•\tChoose over 44 themes (22 dark and 22 light) through In-App Purchase. \n\nWhen you use the HUD mode, you can put your iPhone on the dashboard near the windshield.

Navigate your city’s public transit system with accurate real-time predictions, simple trip planning, step-by-step navigation, service disruption notifications, and departure and stop reminders... all presented in a clear, bold interface. Public transport not cooperating? Easily request a ride from Uber, Lyft or VIA, or grab the closest bikeshare.  \n\n10 GREAT THINGS YOU CAN DO WITH TRANSIT:\n1) See real-time arrivals for nearby buses and trains instantly upon launch.\n2) Watch your transit vehicle approaching on a map in real-time\n3) Compare options with powerful A to B trip plans using real-time data.\n4) Launch GO for step-by-step navigation when you’re on an unfamiliar route or want to nap/read/space out.*\n5) Receive departure alarms and stop notifications as well as prompts to pick up the pace in GO.*\n6) Get push notifications if service disruptions will affect your commute.\n7) Plan trips, view transit schedules and get route itineraries—even when you’re offline! \n8) Locate bikeshare stations, see the number of bikes available, pay for passes, and unlock bikes (in select cities). \n9) Check ETA (and price) for nearby Uber, Lyft and VIA rides, and book in two taps.\n10) Easily plan and pay for a trip combining Uber, Lyft, or VIA with transit.

      "label": "iMapp will help you track your friends and relatives who are connected to the service as well as assist you in finding a person's location by request, regardless of whether they have the app on their device installed.\n\nNow, you no longer need to call each other dozens of times to arrange a meeting, you can simply view each other’s locations via a phone number. If all of your family members install the iMapp application, you will be able to know not only their current geolocation, but also the places in which they have visited during the past 60 days.\n\nInstall iMapp and you will be able to:\n\n• track the location of your friends and relatives connected to the service \n• find out the location of any person; regardless of whether they have the app on their device installed (targeted devices should support HTML5)\n• view the time list of location(s) of your friends for last 60 days\n• get notifications when your friends arrive or leave from the places that you have created\n• control the battery level of your friends and family's phones\n• get directions to your friends, events, or any other places that you wish\n• create your own places on the map\n• share your location with your favorite friends in automatic mode\n• use the program for tracking locations of children and relatives\n• send the coordinates of a selected location using the most convenient way\n• use the most energy-saving technology of location tracking.\n\nThe accuracy of coordinates whilst searching for devices using phone number or email depends on the availability of built-in GPS/GSM/WiFi modules on the targeted devices. In the case that there is no GPS, the coordinates are detected according to the data of cellular networks, with the accuracy ranging from 100 to 1000m. If there is no GPS and GSM, then the coordinates are detected via IP address. This function works by sending a unique message - that the app generates - to the phone number supplied which contains the location. The message will be opened every time when you want to update the person's location.\n\nIf you are involved in confidential matters, you may change your status in iMapp so that your mark is displayed only to your favorite friends; or you can make yourself invisible.\n\niMapp has the following subscriptions:\n\niMapp Premium - $4.99/mo, $39.99/yr\niMapp PRO - $9.99/mo, $59.99/yr\nWith Premium, you will be able to connect any number of devices to the iMapp service. This allows you to track connected devices via PC, locate persons using a cell phone and also access 24/7 support. With the PRO version, you get all the features of Premium as well as unlimited moving logs of all your friends and relatives. Premium and PRO yearly subscriptions come with a free 3 day trial. When the trial expires, the subscription will auto-renew on a monthly or yearly basis. You will receive your first charge 3 days after starting your trial. The subscription costs will be charged from your score, linked through an iTunes account. Your subscription will be automatically renewed at regular intervals, according to what you selected, if you do not cancel it earlier than 24 hours before the end of the current period. You will not be able to unsubscribe after you have purchase it. Subscription changes are available in the Settings of your iTunes account after purchase.\n\nSolicited access:\n- to the camera and photo - to install the avatar\n- to contacts - to invite friends\n- to geo-position, including the background mode - to find the devices location\n- to push notifications - to send chat notifications\n\nGet acquainted to the Terms of Use you can on the link below: \nhttp://imap-app.com/Terms.html\nhttp://imap-app.com/privacypolicy.html\n\nNOTE: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease the battery life of the phone"

Welcome to sustainable mobility!\n\n* Do you want to know when the next bus will arrive to your stop, or even get an automatic notification a few minutes before?\n* Or which is the best combination of buses to get to any point in the city?\n* Or how to swiftly move inside Palma combining buses and public bikes?\n* Or how to make sure that your BiciPalma trip closed correctly when you leave your bike in its anchor point?\n\nMobiPalma provides real-time, geolocated information on traffic conditions, the location and occupancy level of parking and public bicycle stations, in addition to all the information on the EMT Palma bus network. It's a free app and it's available in Catalán, Spanish, English and German.\n\nMobiPalma is jointly promoted by the Department of Mobility of Palma de Mallorca City Hall, Emt Palma and SMAP (which manages public parkings and Bicipalma).\n\nWith the MobiPalma app you will be able to:\n\n* Get bus arrival times exactly as in the EMT Palma app, but now also without knowing the bus stop number: choose your bus stop directly on the map; search directly by stop number, seeing the matches as you type; use the new text search engine for locating stops by street name. You can also get the bus arrival time from other screens of the app such as line information.\n\n* Calculate routes between a source and a destination using the bus network or using different combinations of bus, public bike and parkings. You can set the source and destination of the route by searching for street names or places: a hotel, a restaurant, a bar, a shop or a mall... And of course, you can select any point directly on a map of the city that shows your location.\n\n* Consult the information on all bus lines and all bus stops on the network.\n\n* View the closest stops to your location represented on the city map.\n\n\n* Schedule automatic reminders to be at the stop at the right time and don't miss the bus anymore.\n\n* Mark your usual bus stops as favorites and save them with a name for convenience.\n\n* Add to Favorites screen: bus lines, the combination of line and bus stop, Bicipalma bike stations, public car parks, urban road sections with data traffic congestion data and public traffic cameras.\n\n* Check at a glance the status of all your favorites by just opening the app (since \"Your Favorites\" is the initial screen), and even see the arrival time of your favorite stop-line combinations without touching the screen.\n\n* View on a map the congestion status of the main roads of the city.\n\n* Take a look at the live feed of various public traffic cameras.\n\n* Go with your car to a car park knowing in advance the number of available slots and compare the price with other nearby parking options.\n\n* Go to a BiciPalma bike station knowing in advance the number of available bikes and open anchor points, as well as any unusable ones.\n\n* Automatically receive a 25, 30 and 60 minutes after the bike caught push notification (provided it has not already been returned to an anchor.)\n\n* Check from within the app your Bicipalma usage history and, for example, make sure the trip closed correctly when you left the bike in its anchor point, or see any penalty for extra time.\n\n* Be informed of any incident in public roads and in the transport network, regardless of the sender: Town Hall, EMT Palma or SMAP. Notices on important incidents are sent as an automatic notification to your phone, and you can always disable it in the Settings screen."

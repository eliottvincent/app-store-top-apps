      "label": "Turn your iPhone and iPad into a Speedometer with Speedometer One! Speedometer One is also suitable for cars, boats, motorcycles, or other types of vehicles. We have various features to make Speedometer the best speed tracker app for IOS devices. We use GPS to track your speed and alert you when you are over the speed limit. There are other features that will be useful for you such as Night Mode, HUD screen, and many more.  \n\nHave you ever driven a car and worried that you go over the speed limit? Driving too fast can get you into trouble especially if there are some traffic cops nearby with their speed radar gun. That’s why we add Speed Limit Alert as one of the most important features of our app. You can enable and disable it. We support US and EU style speed limit signs and support different display units. This means that it will make it easier to drive when you visit EU or USA. \n\nAside from tracking your speed, Speedometer one also can track your distance, altitude, average speed, and top speed. \n\n=== FEATURES OF SPEEDOMETER ONE: ===\n\n\t•\tAccurate Speedometer for Cars, Boats, Motorcycle or other types of Vehicles. \n\t•\tChoose your units mph, km/h, or knots. \n\t•\tSupport Night Mode with high contrast on the screen. \n\t•\tSupport Landscape or Portrait Mode.\n\t•\tSpeed Limit Alert: Enable this option first, and \n\t•\tHUD (Head Unit Display) Mode \n\t•\tSupports USA and EU speed limit. \n\t•\tChoose over 44 themes (22 dark and 22 light) through In-App Purchase. \n\nWhen you use the HUD mode, you can put your iPhone on the dashboard near the windshield. Our app is very customizable, especially if you’ve unlocked our themes. You can choose the look and display according to your needs: your mood, eyesight, night or day. Our customization is what sets us apart from other similar apps. Try it for yourself today!\n\nIMPORTANT USAGE NOTE: \n\n\t•\tTo be able to use Speedometer One, please allow Location Services.  \n\t•\tSet what kind of vehicle you use and the max speed before using. \n\t•\tSpeedometer One is not compatible with Wifi only iPad or iPod Touch. \n\t•\tOur speed tracker is based on GPS info. GPS sensor is not always accurate due to the device hardware sensor limitation. When in doubt, always rely on your car’s speedometer.\n\t•\tGPS is most accurate when you are in wide-open spaces. Trees, tall buildings, and other things might affect your GPS accuracy. \n\t•\tProlong use of GPS will affect your battery life. \n\t•\tPlease stay safe. Focus on the road ahead and do not interact with any device when you are driving, especially when you are driving at high speed.\n\nLove Speedometer One! Give it a rating and review on our Appstore page and don’t forget to share it with your friends and family! If you encounter a problem when using the app, please send us an email about it and we will work ASAP to fix it."

When you go over a preset speed limit, the large digits change colour from green to red and the device emits a loud sound to alert you! Great for avoiding speeding tickets!\n\n‣ Easy to set and configurable speed limits \nSet speed limits with 4 fast and configurable presets. Presets only need a single tap and are the safest way to set the limits! \n\n‣ S.O.S. Flat tyre or worse? \nOur speedometer shows your current location and you can share it easily (sms/text, email) with car assistance services, ambulance or friends. \n\n‣ Know your car's limits ! \nDoes your car become sluggish on those steep climbs? Is it possible you got too high in mountains ? Our built-in altimeter will provide you with accurate readings that indicate your height over sea-level. \n\n‣ In a dispute for speeding?\nGPS Black box gives you point by point time, speed, location and altitude data for the last 20 minutes of your travel. You can email its data as an excel or csv file. Or you can surely switch it off or reset at any moment.\n\n‣ Need to know where you are?\nIntegrated map shows your location and a tracking \"tail\" behind you.\n\n∙∙ UNIVERSAL APP. Speedometer for iPhone and 3G-iPads. Retina graphics included. \n\n∙∙ 000-999 SPEED AND LIMIT RANGE. MPH, KMH AND KNOTS. Maximum, average speed, distance traveled. \n\n! You can use this app on your iPhone 3GS, 4, or 4S as well as on any iPad with 3G. **App will not work properly on iPods and wifi only iPads as they don't have GPS chip (External GPS module is required).\n! Please note that as with all GPS apps, continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. \n\nDrive safely and avoid paying those speeding fines! Our speedometer is the ideal watchdog companion no matter what journey you are going on!\n\nFull version of the speedometer gives you ability to work in background, GPS tracking, waypoints, trip cost computer, Siri shortcuts for applying speed limits and controlling track recording, 100+ customization options and more. Be sure to check it out in the AppStore!\n\n* A bit of instructions: If speedometer doesn't show you the speed, just be sure to be under the open sky to have GPS signal. Under the open sky, within 5-10 seconds GPS indicator will become green and speedometer will start showing the speed.\n** If you wonder why gps speedometer may show 3-5 mph (3-8 kmh) less than a car's speedometer, you can take a look here: http://goo.gl/wtLvT (tomtom's discussion thread).\n*** And here is an amazing article http://goo.gl/p5zfMi explaining why GPS might show you 80ft (or -80!) altitude when you are laying on the beach. Don't throw the app or iPhone away just because of that! :) Let us use the article's last sentence here: \"Those who use GPS altitude to aid in landing their small plane should have their insurance policies paid up at all times\"."

Teams of hunters, field workers, parents/children, drivers, hikers and responders may find this app useful for coordinating their location related activities.\n\n► Invite members.\nMembers are invited with a simple code. No registration or sign up is required.\n\n► Control location sharing/tracking.\nYour location only leaves your iPhone or iPad when you enable team tracking in the app.\n• When team tracking is ON:\n 1. Your location is sent to the server and shared with your team members. \n 2. App stays working in the background and continues to share your location with team members (via server) even if it is not visible on a screen.\n• When team tracking is OFF:\n 1. Your location data will not leave your phone and is not shared in any way.\n 2. App is removed from memory when it is not visible on a screen.\n\n► Members on the map.\nBy default map follows your own location. Tap on a member row and pick \"Center on map\" to have map centered on the member's location.\n\n► Navigate to a moving team member. \nTap on a member row, pick \"Set as target\". The app will show a line between you and the team member, so you can see the course to take to the member, even if they move. To show your own course line, hold your finger on the map and pick \"Show course line\".\n\n► Member alerts.\nAdd polygonal or circular zones and setup alerts for team members leaving or entering.\nAlerts for member's speed being below or above some threshold.\nAlerts for distance between you and team members.\n\n► Status and messages.\nMembers can set up their own statuses and apply them with 2 taps to make others aware of their status.\nIf short status is not enough, members can type in a message to share within the team.\n\n► Customizable map corner panels.\nYour own or member data can be shown, like:\nSpeed, altitude, coordinates (Lat/Long, UTM or MGRS).\nDistance between yourself/member and a waypoint, or between two members.\n\n► Battery impact.\n- When you have team tracking OFF, the app is completely removed from memory when it is not visible on the screen and doesn't consume battery or GPS.\n- When team tracking is ON, the app will use GPS and will keep sending data to the server whether it is visible on the screen or not. This implies higher battery consumption than usual. \nBy default, your location is synchronized with the server/team every 5 seconds. You can change this in the app settings > Team synchronization to a slower sync interval and save both battery and data.\n\n▼ Free version limitations:\nNumber of team members is limited.\nMaximum of 2 zones/overlays.\nSynchronization interval is limited to 5 seconds or slower.\nGPS Beacon history is limited to 4 hours.\n\nFree version covers you going with your child/friend for a hike and following each other. Or following a teen driver, including speed alerts.\n\n▼ PRO Pack subscription:\nNo limits on member or zone count.\nSynchronization frequency of up to 1 per second.\nGPS Beacon history up to 24 hours.\n• Subscriptions available:\nPRO Pack 1-month subscription - $1.99 per month.\n\n▼ To manage your subscription:\n• TURN OFF auto-renewal via the main Settings app: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht4098\n• Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. Your iTunes account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours of the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal.\n• Your iTunes Account will be charged at confirmation of purchase.\n\n▼ Privacy Policy\nhttps://sites.google.com/a/blocoware.com/speedohelp/teamwork/privacypolicy\n▼ Terms of use\nhttps://sites.google.com/a/blocoware.com/speedohelp/teamwork/terms_of_use\n\nPlease note that continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

Start creating your own map today with the stops that matter for YOU, and for a limited time only get a lifetime membership for free when you create an account!\n\nLook Ahead, Not Back\nWe all drive by more than a dozen places every day that we wish we could remember the next time we come through. OTR Places solves this need, allowing you to drive with confidence at all times. So the next time you need a stop, you can check ahead, rather than wishing you stopped earlier.\n \nYour Map, Your Stops, Your Way\nWith OTR Places quickly and safely save any POI you wish to remember while driving or stationary. When you get close to a stop you have already saved in the app, OTR Places gently reminds you of the upcoming stops. It gives you the distance and any other information you chose to save about your locations; just what you need, exactly when you need it. \n \nDrive Without The Mystery \nOTR Places will soon become your go-to app for information on all your stops. It is exactly what you need because you created it. Giving you only the information you need. No more searching the web in multiple locations, trying to stitch together the information you need, no more wondering what a spot is really like. Know what is out there with confidence. The more you use it, the better it works!\n\nThe Information You Need\nYou are the boss. Your stops and preferences are the only things we care about. With OTR Places, you only see the places you choose to save. Say goodbye to the hundreds of irrelevant icons and ads cluttering your screen and discover a new way of viewing your stops!\n\nBuild Your Map Your Way \nEnter as much or as little information as you see fit, and build your map your way. Customize your stops and categories and get creative with emojis!\n \nBy Truckers, For Truckers\n“As a veteran OTR driver I found myself facing the same problem day after day: I would see a dozen places a day that I really wanted to remember the next time I came this way. A ramp with wide shoulders, rest areas, any number of good spots to shut down for the night, etc.. but of course, the same thing happened the next time. I would never remember. By the time I saw something it was either too late to take advantage of it or the wrong time. I thought “there should be an app for that” and so with the help of my awesome friends at Pin Traveler, we created Trucker’s Buddy! It lets you quickly, safely, and accurately mark anything that interests you, and the next time you travel that way, it will tell and show you exactly what is ahead of you. I drive longer, safer, and with much less concern than ever before. It has changed my OTR experience for the better. I hope you find it as useful as I do.”\n- Mike, Co-Founder & Veteran OTR Driver\n \n==========================\n \nIf you enjoy using OTR Places and make sure to leave us a 5-star review!\n \nFor questions, comments, or support; send us an email at hello@truckersbuddy.net or use the feedback button in the app.\n \nWebsite: https://otrplaces.com\n \n==========================\n \nPremium Membership\nOTR Places is a Premium Service designed for power users.

You can see the movement of hunting dogs and other hunters on your smartphone, share information between hunters and create your own hunting map.\n\nTracking a common hunt is easy\nOne of the members of the hunt starts hunting on his or her phone and receives a unique code. Other hunters join the hunt using this code. This creates a hunting team whose movement is visible on the phone map. When the owner of a hunting dog with a Huntloc tracking device joins the hunt, all participants will also be able to see the dog's location. \nHunting with Huntloc is more effective, safer and more fun\n•\tWhile on a common hunt, your phone shows the current location of dogs and hunters, the direction of movement, the pace of movement, and the distance traveled. Hunting and dog tracking are unlimited in distance.\n•\tDuring the hunt, you can send messages to the participants and share the location of the various hunting events on the map (e.g., a caught game, an animal track, etc.). Plus, you can quickly call any hunter.\n•\tThe different maps of Google and the Estonian Land Board and the hunting objects recorded by the hunter themselves (e.g., animal feeding places and other hunting-related locations and areas) give an accurate overview of the hunting ground. You can share your hunting objects with other Huntloc users. \n•\tWhen navigating in the hunt, you can set a navigation target and then use the compass view to arrive at the desired location by the shortest route.\n•\tA 24-hour weather forecast with sunrise and sunset time will help you plan your hunt. You can view the weather forecast for your own location or for a location selected on the map.\n•\tHuntloc's portal.huntloc.com can be used for viewing the hunts you have participated in and for more convenient drawing of the hunting card.\n\nThe location of a dog with the Huntloc tracking device can be seen on your smartphone\nThe Huntloc tracking device provides a very accurate position of the dog in the terrain. The tracking device uses the mobile network and has no distance limitation - the dog can be tracked from thousands of kilometers away. All you need is a smartphone to monitor your dog and control your device. In addition to tracking, you can call the dog, listen to the dog's activities and give voice commands. Keeping the device constantly on the dog's neck, it acts as a security device and can be switched on from a distance when the dog is lost. \n\nThe tracking device is very strong, lightweight, waterproof and has a long service life. The monitoring time is 36 hours (10 seconds interval) and the standby time is 1 month. In order to ensure waterproofing, there are no openings or buttons on the unit, and the 3 indicator lights indicate the unit's operating status. The device is charged wirelessly."

The impressions and data you collect on your rides are automatically saved under your rides.\r\n\nSimply use Bluetooth to connect to your motorbike, which is equipped with Connectivity features and a TFT display, and, if available, establish a connection to your communication system. Whether you want a scenic, winding route or the fastest way from A to B, voice commands and the clear TFT display with arrows providing directions will guide you and your motorbike safely to your destination.

The connection is established wirelessly between a smartphone, the vehicle and – if available – a communication system via Bluetooth; the app is operated using the multi-controller on the handlebar. We recommend using the BMW Motorrad communication system for listening to music, making telephone calls and receiving navigation instructions.\r\n•\tA mobile Internet connection is required to access traffic information. This may incur costs in line with the contract between the customer and their mobile provider (e.g. for roaming).\r\n•\tPlease note that the functionality of your smartphone and the connection to the vehicle also depend on national requirements and factors; BMW Motorrad therefore cannot guarantee that it will be available at all times.\r\n•\tThe BMW Motorrad Connected app will be displayed in the language you have set for your smartphone. Please note that not all languages are supported.\r\n•\tContinued use of GPS tracking in the background may reduce the battery life of your smartphone.\r\nMake Life a Ride."

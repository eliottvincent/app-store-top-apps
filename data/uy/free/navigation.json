In the event of an incident, you’ll immediately have all the evidence you need to fight your case, all in your phone. You may even share access to your video with friends and family via the DriverCloud.\n \nWHY CHOOSE DRIVER:\nRecord your drives\nNo recording time limits!

The feature is available on iPhone XS/XR or newer.\n \nNever lose video data\nAlways find a backup video stored in the DriverCloud.

The system will start calibrating at a speed threshold of about 20mph.\n\n \nTIPS:\n- Mount your phone on a dashboard phone holder (shorter ones provide greater video stability/use magnetic dash mounts for easy mounting)\n- For longer trips, keep your phones plugged into your charger (USB cable)\n- During hot summer days, avoid prolonged exposure to direct sunlight\n \nABOUT DRIVER:\nAt Driver, our mission is to make driving safer and smarter for everyone.

Colour coded icons make identification easy too.\n\nIf you like this app you'll love the full version of Ship Finder.\n\nThe full version includes a huge array of additional features including route history, search, filters, bookmarks, photos, the ability to add favourite ships and much more.\n\nShip Finder works by picking up AIS ship feeds used by all passenger vessels, vessels over 300 tons and increasingly by smaller pleasure craft and yachts. This technology is actually faster than radar and is used by vessels for safety and navigation.\n\nShip Finder provides near real time “virtual radar” AIS maps. It’s easy to use and is an amazing app for anyone interested in shipping, cruising and sailing in ports and locations across the world. It’s also great if you simply want to know what boats are out there or want to see where your friends and family are. Ship Finder is also used extensively by maritime professionals and mariners.\n\nOur global AIS coverage is impressive and expanding all of the time as we add new AIS feeds and receivers. Please check www.shipfinder.co regularly to see the latest coverage.\n\nPinkfroot are committed to customer service and continually improve our Ship Finder apps based on feedback. Why not join our online community at www.pinkfroot.com or if you have any questions please email us via support@pinkfroot.com and we’ll be happy to help. \n\nDisclaimer: Ship Finder should not be used for navigational purposes. \nUnder no circumstances will the developer of this application be held responsible for incidents resulting from the use of the data or its interpretation."

      "label": "Designed with the user of public transport in mind, but without forgetting the drivers, MobiPalma is the ultimate app for moving around Palma and now fully accessible to blind people. Welcome to sustainable mobility!\n\n* Do you want to know when the next bus will arrive to your stop, or even get an automatic notification a few minutes before?\n* Or which is the best combination of buses to get to any point in the city?\n* Or how to swiftly move inside Palma combining buses and public bikes?\n* Or how to make sure that your BiciPalma trip closed correctly when you leave your bike in its anchor point?\n\nMobiPalma provides real-time, geolocated information on traffic conditions, the location and occupancy level of parking and public bicycle stations, in addition to all the information on the EMT Palma bus network. It's a free app and it's available in Catalán, Spanish, English and German.\n\nMobiPalma is jointly promoted by the Department of Mobility of Palma de Mallorca City Hall, Emt Palma and SMAP (which manages public parkings and Bicipalma).\n\nWith the MobiPalma app you will be able to:\n\n* Get bus arrival times exactly as in the EMT Palma app, but now also without knowing the bus stop number: choose your bus stop directly on the map; search directly by stop number, seeing the matches as you type; use the new text search engine for locating stops by street name. You can also get the bus arrival time from other screens of the app such as line information.\n\n* Calculate routes between a source and a destination using the bus network or using different combinations of bus, public bike and parkings. You can set the source and destination of the route by searching for street names or places: a hotel, a restaurant, a bar, a shop or a mall... And of course, you can select any point directly on a map of the city that shows your location.\n\n* Consult the information on all bus lines and all bus stops on the network.\n\n* View the closest stops to your location represented on the city map.\n\n\n* Schedule automatic reminders to be at the stop at the right time and don't miss the bus anymore.\n\n* Mark your usual bus stops as favorites and save them with a name for convenience.\n\n* Add to Favorites screen: bus lines, the combination of line and bus stop, Bicipalma bike stations, public car parks, urban road sections with data traffic congestion data and public traffic cameras.\n\n* Check at a glance the status of all your favorites by just opening the app (since \"Your Favorites\" is the initial screen), and even see the arrival time of your favorite stop-line combinations without touching the screen.\n\n* View on a map the congestion status of the main roads of the city.\n\n* Take a look at the live feed of various public traffic cameras.\n\n* Go with your car to a car park knowing in advance the number of available slots and compare the price with other nearby parking options.\n\n* Go to a BiciPalma bike station knowing in advance the number of available bikes and open anchor points, as well as any unusable ones.\n\n* Automatically receive a 25, 30 and 60 minutes after the bike caught push notification (provided it has not already been returned to an anchor.)\n\n* Check from within the app your Bicipalma usage history and, for example, make sure the trip closed correctly when you left the bike in its anchor point, or see any penalty for extra time.\n\n* Be informed of any incident in public roads and in the transport network, regardless of the sender: Town Hall, EMT Palma or SMAP. Notices on important incidents are sent as an automatic notification to your phone, and you can always disable it in the Settings screen."

We've also carefully designed FeedFinder so that it can be used one-handed as much as possible so that you can even be adding a review of a breastfeeding place as you breastfeed your little one.\n\nYou can use FeedFinder to find places around you where other mothers have had positive breastfeeding experiences. Every recommended place on the map will have been reviewed by someone who's breastfeeding. You'll be able to see not only how they have rated that place, but also any handy comments that they have added about their experience or the location, like whether they have toys and a menu for toddlers, or where the breastfeeding room is if it's a bit difficult to find.\n\nIf you can't find somewhere near you, or have found a new gem be sure to add the new place to the map. You'll find the process easy and convenient with FeedFinder doing most the hard work, like locating the place on the map, or adding the address details – all you'll need to do is add a star rating and your own comments. \n\nFeedFinder is part of a project by Open Lab Newcastle University, UK.

There's no need to carry cash in your pockets, nor to search for a parking meter.

Moreover, you don’t have to pay beforehand.\n\nThese are the main advantages of using Telpark:\n- Pay safely in city council regulated areas without going to the parking meter and without using any paper.\n\n- Extend your parking time allowance without getting back to the car.\n- With one app, you can pay in the city council regulated areas and soon also at Empark car parks in Spain and Portugal.\n- Get notifications in your mobile when your parking time is about to expire.\n- Find your car thanks to the GPS position \n- Secure payments with credit card or Paypal\n- Manage all the vehicles from one single account\n- Without pre-payments\n- You can use it in more than 50 cities in Spain and 11 in Portugal\n- Cancel parking ticket fines directly from your mobile (in cities where local regulations allow it)"

      "label": "Ever wondered what ship it is you see passing a few miles off the beach?? This App gives you the ability to find out all the details of the ship, including size, speed, course, destination, estimated time of arrival and much more. All done with an easy to use and great looking App, which supports both iPhone and iPad.\n\nWhat people are saying about our App: \"Best user interface of any ship app I have tried\" B. Colson, Maine. \"Love the graphical design and the large icons that makes it easy to determine the ship type\" R. Clark, London. \n\nOpenSeaMap data is now accessible from within the app giving the possibility of showing the map data delivered by OpenSeaMap which includes seamarks, navigational rules and buoys in many areas of the world.\n\nFurthermore, you may measure the distance to the ships from your position, as you may measure distance between any two ships. This will show you if they are really on collision course or if it's just an illusion.\n\nSee the ships displayed on the map with large and crystal clear icons.\n\nBuilt-in compass and \"direction\" vector which helps find the direction of the ships and vessels. \n\nFurthermore, images of the ships may be watched or uploaded directly from the app.\n\nThis version supports iOS split screen multitasking found on selected device.\n\nAlso we added the possibility to place user defined waypoints on the map (press and hold your finger on map). The waypoints can be used as measurement points from the user or between ships. Furthermore, by pressing the waypoint the position is copied to the clipboard, making it easy to paste positions into other applications. Pressing the callout of the waypoint will prepare a text message with the position ready to send to other users.Once the text message is received the user can press it and get the position up in various maps apps. This functionality has been requested by search and rescue workers who would like a tool to help pin point positions to colleagues out at sea.\n\nMake sure to check out our FREE version of the app (Trackaship Superlite) before buying if in doubt about the coverage of you local area.

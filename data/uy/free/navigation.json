We've also carefully designed FeedFinder so that it can be used one-handed as much as possible so that you can even be adding a review of a breastfeeding place as you breastfeed your little one.\n\nYou can use FeedFinder to find places around you where other mothers have had positive breastfeeding experiences. Every recommended place on the map will have been reviewed by someone who's breastfeeding. You'll be able to see not only how they have rated that place, but also any handy comments that they have added about their experience or the location, like whether they have toys and a menu for toddlers, or where the breastfeeding room is if it's a bit difficult to find.\n\nIf you can't find somewhere near you, or have found a new gem be sure to add the new place to the map. You'll find the process easy and convenient with FeedFinder doing most the hard work, like locating the place on the map, or adding the address details – all you'll need to do is add a star rating and your own comments. \n\nFeedFinder is part of a project by Open Lab Newcastle University, UK.

Easily request a ride from Uber, Lyft or VIA, or grab the closest bikeshare.  \n\n10 GREAT THINGS YOU CAN DO WITH TRANSIT:\n1) See real-time arrivals for nearby buses and trains instantly upon launch.\n2) Watch your transit vehicle approaching on a map in real-time\n3) Compare options with powerful A to B trip plans using real-time data.\n4) Launch GO for step-by-step navigation when you’re on an unfamiliar route or want to nap/read/space out.*\n5) Receive departure alarms and stop notifications as well as prompts to pick up the pace in GO.*\n6) Get push notifications if service disruptions will affect your commute.\n7) Plan trips, view transit schedules and get route itineraries—even when you’re offline! \n8) Locate bikeshare stations, see the number of bikes available, pay for passes, and unlock bikes (in select cities). \n9) Check ETA (and price) for nearby Uber, Lyft and VIA rides, and book in two taps.\n10) Easily plan and pay for a trip combining Uber, Lyft, or VIA with transit. We call it Transit+ \n\n*continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\n5-STAR USER REVIEWS\n“Your app was the deciding factor in selling my car”\n“Blows Google Maps out of the water.” \n\"Probably the best thing on my phone, no joke.\"\n“The head of our local transit agency recommended this app over the one her agency created.”\n\"Truly ingenious work here.

If all of your family members install the iMapp application, you will be able to know not only their current geolocation, but also the places in which they have visited during the past 60 days.\n\nInstall iMapp and you will be able to:\n\n• track the location of your friends and relatives connected to the service \n• find out the location of any person; regardless of whether they have the app on their device installed (targeted devices should support HTML5)\n• view the time list of location(s) of your friends for last 60 days\n• get notifications when your friends arrive or leave from the places that you have created\n• control the battery level of your friends and family's phones\n• get directions to your friends, events, or any other places that you wish\n• create your own places on the map\n• share your location with your favorite friends in automatic mode\n• use the program for tracking locations of children and relatives\n• send the coordinates of a selected location using the most convenient way\n• use the most energy-saving technology of location tracking.\n\nThe accuracy of coordinates whilst searching for devices using phone number or email depends on the availability of built-in GPS/GSM/WiFi modules on the targeted devices. In the case that there is no GPS, the coordinates are detected according to the data of cellular networks, with the accuracy ranging from 100 to 1000m.

All widgets work in regular or head-up display (HUD) mode. \n\nSpeedometers:\n— Classic digital speedometer\n— Digital, with compass, odometer, and distance traveled (Chevrolet Aveo style)\n— A set of retro speedometers: Cadillac style, arched, circular\n\nGPS trip information:\n— See how safely you drive: the app calculates your driving score based on your acceleration, braking, turns, and speeding data. \n— Know your fuel consumption per each trip and the expenses on it.\n— Information on your current, maximum and average speed, distance and time traveled\n— Large compass\n— Eco-driving. Acceleration and deceleration graphs indicate driving efficiency\n\nOther:\n— Internet Radio\n— Land meter. Indicates the angle of car slope or tilt — pitching and rolling\n— Weather and clock\n\nLaunch the app, select the widget, and place the smartphone close to the windshield (to use it in HUD mode, with the screen image reflected onto the windshield), or fix it in the mount. \n\nAttention!\n1. On a clear day, the device screen brightness is typically insufficient to give a decent reflection for HUD mode. In that situation, you can use the app in standard mode with the phone fixed with some mount, OR stay HUD using our HUDWAY Glass accessory (more at hudwayglass.com or see bellow). At night, in dusk, or in dull weather the reflection is normally well-discernible.\n\n2. Continuous use of geolocation services (GPS and GLONASS) may drain your device battery fast.\n\n3. When driving, make sure that your smartphone or tablet is well fixed in some mount or on some sticky pad, and doesn't prevent you from clearly seeing the road.\n\nHUDWAY Glass car accessory makes smartphone work as a head-up display in any car even in daytime. Removes doubling, offers sharp enlarged reflection image.\nLearn more: http://hudwayglass.com\n\nPrivacy Policy\nhttp://hudwayapp.com/privacy\n\nTerms of Use\nhttp://hudwayapp.com/en/terms/"

Its main local features  are similar to our XFirePlus app, which are:\n\n- Local browser for quick navigation.\n- Search intelligence. \n- Bookmark management.\n- Caching to optimize the web browsing. \n- Visual Tabs to find content for future reference.\n- Open as many tabs as you like without losing track of your open Web pages.\n- Access to a Firefox running in a remote machine. Your Ip address will never be tracked.\n\nBut be aware that CroPlus includes a remote connection to a Cloud system from which you will be able to run a Midori web browser. As such, it inherits all the Midori functionalities. It supports many of the most popular parts of the web, including Google, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Spotify and Rdio."

      "label": "The GPS Phone Tracking App makes it easy to keep track of life’s essentials; use it to:\n\n• Find Your Friends – and get directions to their location.\n• Find Your Phone – check the app’s Web site to find a lost device.\n• Stay Connected – discover your friends’ whereabouts at any time simply by checking the GPS Phone Tracking map.\n\nThe GPS Phone Tracking does it all.\nThis handy, easy-to-use app leverages the latest technology to help you stay connected in real time to the people (and the devices) that matter most. GPS Phone Tracking functions, features and benefits include:\n\nGreat Friend Locator.\nGPS Phone Tracking uses GPS coordinates and state-of-the-art GPS location data to report the real-time whereabouts of your friends. Simply install the GPS tracker app on your phone and your friends’ phones. Once registered, each friend appears as a unique icon on the GPS Tracking Pro’s navigational map so you’ll know exactly where each friend is, at all times. Want to know instantly which friends arrived at a party, theater, museum or another planned meet up point? Want to figure out if anyone is stuck in traffic, made a wrong turn or even worse – if your habitually late friend has even left his/her house yet? No need to send annoying “Where are your?” or “What’s your ETA?” texts, GPS Phone Tracking puts this information at your fingertips. And to make life super easy, GPS Tracking Pro can send alerts the moment your friends arrive at the appointed location!\n\nFriend Locator\nWith GPS Phone Tracking, you can monitor your friend’s travel from one location to another via the app’s GPS maps. This is a very helpful feature when you’re traveling separately from a friend who has a tendency to get lost often. And let’s face it: GPS Phone Tracking also makes a great family tracker. This is especially helpful if a family member is scheduled to pick you up. You can track their progress toward your destination, enjoying yourself until the last possible moment you have to be at the agreed upon pick up spot!\n\nReliable Cell Phone Tracker\nGPS Phone Tracking can pinpoint the location of registered mobile devices, smart phones and even old school feature phones via the app’s website, 24/7. Just log in and your phone will appear as an icon. Click on the icon to view the location of the missing mobile phone. This GPS phone tracking device helps with iPhone too. It accesses GPS iPhone data to pinpoint the location of missing Droids.\n\nPhone Tracking for Friends With Feature Phones\nFriends who don’t have the latest smart phone (or a smart phone at all), can still enjoy GPS Phone Tracking’s features and benefits – with a little help from their friends! Here’s how it works: The app will send a text invite to the feature phone. Once your friend accepts the invitation and replies with a “yes,” to the text, their individual icon will appear on the app’s GPS maps. If their phone is lost, the app will provide GPS navigation assistance to help you guide them its destination. It’s a phone tracker extraordinaire.\n\nInnovative and Versatile Phone Locator\nDo you constantly misplace your cell phone and are tired of asking other people (friends or family) to help you find it or if they’ve seen it? GPS Phone Tracking can help. Its state-of-the-art GPS system can keep tabs on registered phones, using satellites to triangulate the exact location of every phone registered to your account. If a phone is ever out of satellite view, GPS Phone Tracking uses triangulation via the nearest cell phone tower and the cell phone carrier’s data to determine the missing phone’s location. This versatile phone locator also offers printer-friendly directions to the misplaced phone’s location. GPS Phone Tracking is compatible with iPhone, whether you have AT&T, Verizon, Sprint or another phone carrier."

Using audio messages, Lazarillo will tell you about nearby places,\n\nthe street you are walking on, street intersections in your way and more! Like a radio, Lazarillo will announce the things around you while you are moving.\n\nThis app was designed and implemented with active feedback from people who are blind.\n\nThe GPS resource is used even if the App is in the background. This allows the user to keep using the app without active usage of the screen, so they can\n\nstill enjoy the features of Lazarillo even when their phone is in their pocket or when using other relevant apps.\n\nNote : \"Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\"\n\nThis app allows you to use its accessibility functions for free, just requires mobile data or a Wi-Fi connection.\n\nTo collaborate with people who are blind, Lazarillo's main feature is to become the user's companion, providing essential information that allows displacement and autonomy.\n\nThe goal is to help the person reach the chosen place in a simple way, receiving Lazarillo indications by voice and notifications of nearby places, institutions,\n\nshops, etc, allowing communication between the user and the city.\n\nThe app contains the following features:\n\nExploration: Provides your actual position, nearby places, and street intersections while you are walking on the street, in a bus or by car.\n\nCategory searches: Allows to find nearby places from a specific category such as banks, health, food, shop, art, entertainment, etc.\n\nSpecific searches: Allows to find a route to any place using voice or keyboard.\n\nHelp information:\n\nLazarillo provides information about establishments that work with blind or visually impaired people. The app is linked to a web platform where the institutions\n\nare able to show important information about events, courses, workshops, and any data that a blind person may need. In that way Lazarillo collaborates\n\nwith these institutions improving the communication among users, providing better connectivity between people with visual disabilities.\n\nFor suggestions and doubts you can visit our web site www.lazarillo.cl\n\nor send us an e-mail to: contacto@lazarillo.cl"

With a one off In App purchase, iAIS can  use all your existing Navionics charts with no additional charges for the charts.\n\nYou can share your boat's live position, speed and course and be visible on other free internet based AIS apps and web sites like BoatWatch and MarineTraffic if you have a valid MMSI number for your boat.\n\nIn the US you can obtain an MMSI number for your boat by visiting http://www.boatus.com/mmsi. \n\nIn the UK visit https://www.ofcom.org.uk/manage-your-licence or email us for an internet only MMSI number.\n\nPlease note that continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nNOT FOR NAVIGATION\niAIS should only be used for basic navigation reference and should not be solely relied upon to determine precise locations, proximity, distance, or direction."

Weather Fit doesn’t just tell people the weather but answers the oh-so difficult question, ‘what to wear?’ And, the app does it in an engaging and fun way. \n\nCreatively informative. \nIt has a cute little character, who has the sense of style. The character dresses according to the weather. In such a way the app shows you what to wear now, today, tonight, and tomorrow. Also, if it’s sunny, the character will put on sunglasses; if it’s rainy — will take an umbrella; if the air isn’t clean enough — an anti-pollution mask. \n\nUniquely personalized experience.\nWhat’s even better is that the avatar is customizable. You can choose its sex, skin tone, haircut, color of hair and eyebrows, glasses, beard and its color. Make it look like yourself or a person you would like to see every day.\n\nImaginative and diverse.\nThere is a nice landscape behind the character, and it is used to display the current or future weather. The landscape changes according to weather conditions, time of day, and season. It’s both a weather forecast and art — beautiful and precise.   \n\nForecast that you can trust.\nWe use a reliable weather source, which implements a scientific approach to predicting weather and not a random numbers generator :)  \n\nIntuitive and slick user experience.\nThe interface is simple and straight to the point: hourly forecast, current conditions, and daily forecast at a glance. All you need to know is on the screen. \n\nA bunch of neat additional stuff: \n• Widget for quick access\n• Light and smooth dark themes\n• Warnings about naughty and dangerous weather \n• Air pollution levels \n\nAnd it’s all for free!\n\nWe have some paid content, but it’s dirty cheap and follows a monthly or yearly subscription model.\n \nA bundle of pleasantries: \n• No ads\n• Free 3-days trial\n• View the character directly in the widget \n\nEven more customization.\nClothes selection for a character so it better reflects the style that you prefer.\n \nAn epic set of a weather oracle. \nIf you are into detailed weather forecasts, we’ve got you covered! The app has weather maps and radar, which show the movement of air masses, clouds, and storms. Also, it has temperature, wind, humidity, and other maps. Basically, it has everything you need to feel like a weather oracle.  \n\nOur love and gratitude. \nYou help us grow, and it’s difficult to describe how much we appreciate it. \n\nNo more frustrating and mood-killing clothing considerations, no more raw, boring data. Get the app, shoot a glance at the screen, and go on with enjoying your days in comfy clothes without getting cold, hot, or wet. \n\nTry it for yourself. \n\n---\n\nSubscriptions will automatically renew unless canceled within 24-hours before the end of the current period. You can cancel anytime with your iTunes account settings. Any unused portion of a free trial will be forfeited if you purchase a subscription.\n \nTerms of Use: https://weatherfit.com/terms-and-conditions.html\nPrivacy Policy: https://weatherfit.com/privacy-policy.html"

      "label": "The app combines highly accurate weather forecast for your location with a 3D map showing development of weather in a broader area in a very interesting way. This allows you to see where precipitation is going to come from or where the wind is blowing from. The uniqueness of the app comes from the amount of data displayed. Forecast of weather, precipitation, wind, cloud cover, atmospheric pressure, snow cover and other meteorological data for different altitudes is available for the whole world. \n\nWIND ANIMATION\nThe Ventusky application solves weather displaying in an interesting way. Wind is displayed using streamlines which clearly portray the continuous development of weather. Airflow on Earth is always in motion and the streamlines depict this motion in an amazing way. This makes the interconnection of all atmospheric phenomena obvious.\n\nWEATHER FORECAST\nWeather forecast for the first three days is available in the app in one-hour steps. For other days, it’s available in three-hour steps. Users can also look up sunrise and sunrise times in a given place or air quality.\n\nWEATHER MODELS\nThanks to the Ventusky application, visitors get data directly from the numerical models that, just a few years ago, were used solely by meteorologists. The app collects data from the most accurate numerical models. Besides the well-known data from the American GFS and HRRR models, it also displays data from the Canadian GEM model and the German ICON model, which is unique thanks to its high resolution for the whole world. Two models, EURAD and USRAD, are based on current radar and satellite readings. These models are able to show precisely current precipitation in US and Europe.\n\nWEATHER FRONTS\nYou can also display weather fronts. We have created a neural network that predicts the positions of cold, warm, occluded, and stationary fronts based on data from weather models. This algorithm is unique, and we are the first on the world who makes global fronts forecast available to users.\n\nLIST OF WEATHER LAYERS\n• Temperature (16 levels)\n• Temperature anomaly\n• Perceived temperature\n• Precipitation (1 hour, 3 hour, long time accumulation)\n• Radar\n• Satellite\n• Wind gusts (1 hour, long time maximum)\n• Air quality (AQI, NO2, SO2, PM10, PM2.5, O3, dust or CO)\n• Probability of aurora\n\nLIST OF WEATHER LAYERS (PREMIUM)\n• Wind (16 levels)\n• Cloud cover (high, middle, low, total)\n• Snow cover (total, new)\n• Humidity (4 layers)\n• Dew point\n• Air pressure\n• CAPE, CIN, LI, Helicity (SRH)\n• Freezing level\n• Wave forecast\n• Ocean currents\n\nLIST OF WEATHER WIDGETS\n• Forecast 4x2\n• Forecast 2x2\n• Forecast 4x4\n• Radar 4x2\n• Radar 2x2\n\nThe app is completely free of ads.

      "label": "The coast of Spain and Portugal together have almost 10000 kilometres, with almost 4300 beaches, some of which are among the best beaches in the world. And the best way to plan your next beach trip is having all the information at hand.\n\nWith iPlaya you'll have a thorough guide to all Spanish and Portuguese beaches, including all their features and services available in them, accurate hourly weather forecast, exclusive drone footage, and users' reviews and photos to help you make your choice.\n\nIf you've already used iPlaya before, you'll notice we’re working hard to offer more and better contents.\nWe want to help you discover the perfect beach for you, so we include curated lists of beaches with photos, drone footage, and enhanced descriptions. And you can still search by name, navigate the lists of provinces and towns, and see the list of nearby beaches.\nAnd of course your list of favorites is there for quick one-tap access.\n\nThe home page is the starting point to discover the perfect beach for you. It’s divided into four sections:\n- FEATURED is a dynamic section, which will grow periodically. In it you will find different types of content: lists of beaches grouped by some common criteria, reviews of specific beaches, stories about a coast area, etc.\n- LISTS groups different ways of searching for beaches: by province or region, by proximity, beaches with drone videos, etc.\n- MY BEACHES is your list, made up of the beaches that you mark as favorites.\n- FIND allows you to search for beaches by name or by setting filters by characteristics or weather conditions.\n\nOnce you choose a beach, you’ll see a Summary with general info and links to the different sections:\n\n- FORECAST, with hourly reports for temperature, sky conditions, water temperature, swell (wave height, period and direction), and wind (speed, direction, gusts). And daily reports for tides and astronomy data (sunrise, sunset, moonrise and moonset).\n- List of TIDES for the next days.\n- FEATURES includes a map showing the location of the beach and the distance from your current location (with the possibility of calculating the route to the beach by car or on foot, or launching the Maps app to get navigation). This section also includes a brief description of the beach, a list of general features (length, width, type of sand, etc.), a list of the main services available at the beach (showers, toilets, sports areas, etc.), info about accessing the beach and safety info. Moreover, it includes a new image gallery with information posters found at the beach. You can contribute your own photos to this gallery.\n- RATINGS, which shows ratings, reviews and photos of the beach shared by users of the app. This is the section you can help grow by rating the beaches you know, writing reviews or uploading photos to share them with other users. (In order to send your ratings you must first login to your iPlaya account. Registering is super quick and easy!).\n- IMAGE GALLERY.\n\nFrom the Summary, you’ll be able to add the beach to your list of favorite beaches, warn us if you’ve spotted jellyfish over the last few hours, and share a photo or comment about the beach.\n\nDon't forget to 'starfish' your favorite beaches. The list will be available on your Apple Watch app so you'll get a summarized forecast on your wrist!\n\nGet iPlaya now and enjoy your holidays!\n\niPlaya Premium includes:\n• Hourly weather forecast for up to 10 days.\n• Tide data for up to 10 days.\n• Videos of some beaches, including dron footage.\n• Additional contents that we keep creating: better beach descriptions, translations, new lists, etc.\n\niPlaya Premium is an auto-renewable subscription.\n\nContact: hola@iplaya.es\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.iplaya.es/politica-privacidad.html\nTerms of Use: https://www.iplaya.es/terminos-uso.html"

      "label": "*** AeroWeather: for pilots, aviation enthusiasts, and everyone who is serious about the weather!\n*** Current and precise weather conditions (METAR) and forecasts (TAF).\n\nAeroWeather Lite provides quick and intuitive access to METAR and TAF for airports worldwide. Data can be shown in its original (raw) format or as fully decoded and easy understandable texts. AeroWeather Lite is helpful for weather preflight-briefings, but also to just get very precise weather. All weather data is cached for offline access. There are many settings for units and format of METAR/TAF available.\n\nThe app features a built-in airport database, which includes basic airport data like sunrise/sunset, twilight times, timezones etc. \n\nAeroWeather Lite offers built-in groups for nearby stations, today widget (pre iOS 14), and earthquakes. Depending on your needs, groups can be shown or hidden in the main list view.\n\nMETAR alert notifications** is an helpful feature to stay up-to-date. Define multiple alerts for each station with the following criteria: flight rule (US NOAA), wind speed, temperature, pressure, present weather, visibility, and ceiling (BKN and OVC). Notifications will be sent to your device if the criteria is met (e.g., when wind is greater/equal 10 kts, flight rule becomes IFR).\n\nDedicated METAR/TAF** access is optionally available. METAR/TAF data comes primarily from a certified ANSP (air navigation service provider) and is provided reliably and fast from our dedicated, redundant servers (indicated by blue checkmark underneath METAR/TAF).\n\nThe AeroPix feature offers users the possibility to take quickly picture(s) of the weather at their current location. The pictures will be available to all other pilots (on the map or within an airport detail view) helping them to get a better idea about local conditions. AeroPix should be especially helpful when there's no or insufficient webcam coverage.\n\nThere's also an iMessage app included which lets you easily send METAR/TAF of any airport to other users.\n\nPlease consult our web-site for a full description of all features. In order to keep AeroWeather Lite free we added a small ad banner at the bottom of the screen. Consider getting AeroWeather Pro, subscribe the additional features**, or remove the ad banner through one-time unlock* to have an ad-free app.\n\n\n* Additional functionality which needs to be unlocked (one-time purchase). These purchases are not transferable between Lite, Pro, and Mac.\n\n** SUBSCRIPTIONS\nAdditional features which generate recurring operation costs for us will be offered within a subscription. The following features are enabled while 'First' subscription is active:\n - Dedicated METAR/TAF data source\n - Meteograms\n - Alert push notifications\n - D-ATIS (bigger US airports only)\n - Area Forecast Discussions (currently US only)\n - Home Screen Widgets for METAR, Plot, Meteogram (iOS 14 or higher)\n - Imagery and Charts (requires 'Captain' subscription)\n - SIGMETs (requires 'Captain' subscription)\n - METAR/TAF from ADS-B receiver thru GDL 90 protocol (requires 'Captain' subscription)\n\nWhen using AeroWeather Lite also the following features are enabled:\n - Remove ad banner\n\nThe subscription varies in time periods (1 month, 12 months). The subscription is valid in both AeroWeather Lite and Pro. Cross app subscription support is only available if iCloud (with the same Apple ID) is enabled. Previously purchased unlock features are not affected and will work with or without subscription.\n\nAuto-renewal may be turned off at any time by going to your account settings. A payment will be charged to your iTunes account at the end of the free trial period. Your iTunes account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. No commitment - you can cancel any time.\n\nPleas read the full “Subscription Terms of Use” at:\nhttps://www.lakehorn.com/subscription-terms-of-use/"

It also displays the current temperature and humidity.\n• Display barometric pressure (sensor value) or mean sea level pressure (MSLP - value used in weather forecast services or stations).\n• Units support for pressure: mb, inHg, kPa, atm, Torr, psi, hPa, mmHg. Units for altitude: meter, feet.\n• Calibrate the barometer using altitude/location from the GPS. Calibrate the altimeter using the nearest airport information/METAR, or manually enter the QNH of the nearest airport. Offset sensor output value.\n• Measure the height (building/mountain/hiked/climbed) using the \"Relative Altitude\" feature (can be enabled in the app's Settings).\n• Notification about pressure change. \"Notification custom rule\" for you to define how and when the app sends notifications.\nNotify when air pressure changes indicate that extreme or worse weather may occur.\n• \"Pressure Tracking\" and \"History Graph\" require \"Background App Refresh\" or \"Always Location Service\" with \"Exact update interval\" (paid feature) enabled.\n• \"My Area\" allows you to define your frequent stay places, and the app tracks air pressure with location data.\n• Export history to CSV format and Today widget (paid features).\n• This app is the digital version compared with an aneroid or mercury barometer and can be adjusted to MSLP with additional features.\n\nCUSTOMIZABLE:\nYou can change your barometer/altimeter appearance with:\n• Seven different housing colors.\n• Black, white or blue disk background.\n• Four different app backgrounds.\n• Three different types of needles.\n• Marker needle for easily monitor.\n• Dark or light Today widget theme.\n\nNOTES:\n• App only works on devices with a barometer sensor, such as iPhone 6/6s/7/8/X/11/12/13 (including Plus models), iPad Mini 4/Air 2/Pro, or later.\n• Weather icons on the dial: This only shows the air pressure trend like in an analog barometer.\n• Each time your device reboots, open the app for tracking with the \"Exact update interval\" feature work.\n• You may take the phone/tablet far away from computers, cables, and other magnetic sources to get accurate results.\n\nIf you like this app, please support us - you can remove ads or unlock paid features from the menu: Shop.\nWe welcome your ideas and suggestions - please email us at: support+barometer@pvdapps.com.\nFollow our official Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/barometerplus/ or Twitter account: https://twitter.com/pvdapps."

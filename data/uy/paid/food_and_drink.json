      "label": "Struggle free, healthy and practical recipes that are easy on the wallet. It’s as simple as that, and it’s a message that’s seen over 1 million people follow FitMenCook on social media.\n\nBe honest, have you ever heard these complaints about healthy eating?\n\n- “Eating healthy is too expensive!”\n- “It takes too long! I don’t have hours to spend in the kitchen.”\n- “Healthy food is too bland”\n- “I always end up cheating and slipping back in to bad habits”\n\nKevin Curry, founder of FitMenCook, has been there. After spotting a picture of himself on a friend’s Facebook wall he knew it was time for a change.\n\nHe followed all the common advice, changed to a healthy diet and started hitting the gym.\n\nFor a few months, things were great, but after a while he found himself craving the old foods he was trying so hard to avoid.\n\nHe got his hands on every book he could find on nutrition and started experimenting in the kitchen.\n\nHis aims were simple:\n\nA) Food should be easy to prepare and affordable\nB) Food should be vibrant and tasty, never boring\nC) Preparing food in advance is important\nD) Following a, b, c helps you achieve your fitness goals\n\nThe results for Kevin were game change and now he’s spreading message to the FitMenCook community on social media and inside the FMC app.\n\nTop 5 features:\n\n#1\nSHOPPING CART + APPLE WATCH\n\nWe've taken the hassle out of grocery shopping. Add any recipes you want to your shopping list and we'll organise the list by aisle, so you can easily find the items you need.\n\nThe shopping list also works on the Apple Watch.\n\n#2\nEASY STEP BY STEP VIDEO INSTRUCTIONS\n\nIf you’ve ever looked at recipe instructions and thought “this just looks too difficult for me” then you’ll find the included recipe videos very helpful. Not only is Kevin a great host, who’ll fill you with inspiration for healthy meals, but he’ll also break down the steps in a way that’s easy to follow.\n\n#3\nFOCUS ON MEAL PREP\n\nBuying ingredients in small quantities can make recipes more expensive. Not only that, but many of us don’t have time every day to spend in the kitchen.\n\nMeal prep is the solution. By designating two days of the week as your main cooking days, you can prepare your meals in bulk and eat healthy all week.\n\nThis is a crucial part of the app, and many of the meals are designed with meal preparation in mind, to make healthy living fit with a busy life.\n\n#4\nMACRO COUNTING AND INTEGRATION WITH APPLE HEALTH APP\n\nBodybuilders and fat-loss superheroes can rejoice as the FitMenCook app has nutritional information built right in! Recipes list calories, protein, carbs and fat. This data can then be shared with the Apple Health app.\n\n5#\nSCALE UP A RECIPE\n\nIncrease the serving sizes by tapping the + and - buttons in the recipe view. You can also switch the measurements between metric and imperial.\n\nThere’s more including:\n- 750+ recipes with more added each month\n- Search by ingredient: Type in Egg Avocado to see all recipes containing both of these ingredients\n- Share recipes with friends and family\n- Available in English and Spanish\n\nFor a video demonstration of the app in action, take a look at: http://fitmencook.com/app/\n\nOptional Meal Planner Subscription:\nFitMenCook Pro is available as a monthly (0.99 USD) or yearly (5.99 USD) subscription.

Also remember to select the thickness of the edges and the bottom. A difference of a few millimetres will result in errors of several tens of grams.\n\n3 - Place the phone on the container.\n\n4 - Use your fingers to choose the diameter, making it match that of the container.\n\n5 - Place the phone next to the container and use your finger to choose the level of the measurement. If your phone has a cover, remove it, otherwise SUBTRACT the thickness of the cover from the thickness of the edge.\n\n6 - At this point you'll get the grams or millilitres if you are measuring a liquid.\n\nFor the first few times check the measurements, just to get started. Measurements made with this application are only approximate. They are quite precise, but they cannot be compared to measurements on scales."

      "label": "Caveman Feast for iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch contains 250 delicious Paleo recipes that are beautifully illustrated and easy to follow.\n\nThere's nothing really revolutionary about the Paleo diet. It's what our grandma's have been telling us for years: \"Eat real foods that are healthy, avoid highly processed factory foods and you'll feel better and live happier\".\n\nWhether you call it Paleo, real food, low carb, low sugar, grain-free, gluten-free ancestral, nutrient-dense, primal or whole food - the important thing is that the Paleo diet is a healthier way of eating. The list of benefits people have reported is enormous: \n● Weight loss ● More energy that doesn't vary wildly throughout the day ● Improved sleep ● Clearer skin ● Better digestion ● Improved fitness ● Reduced allergies. The list goes on but it's better to try it for yourself.\n\nThe 250 Paleo recipes included will help satisfy your cravings for delicious, healthy food. Inside Caveman Feast you'll find healthy breakfasts, filling main meals, tasty desserts, side dishes and snacks. \n\nRecipes include:\n● Perfect paleo burger\n● Paleo french toast\n● Healthy caveman cookies \n● Blueberry espresso brownies\n● Grilled buffalo shrimp\n● Smoked avocado lime pork chops\n● Apple dijon burgers\n● Homemade healthy mayonnaise\n● Caveman crunch bars\n● Sweet potato pasta\n● Beasty BBQ sauce\n● Caveman shepherd's pie\n\nFeatures in the app include:\n● Add recipes to your shopping list and see it organised by aisle, saving time at the grocery store\n● Track your calories and macros with our nutritional data\n● Increase or decrease recipe servings\n● Search by ingredient\n● Add notes to recipes\n● Share recipes with friends\n● Switch the measurement units\n● Plan a week of meals\n● Tick off your shopping list on your Apple Watch\n● Integrated with Apple Health\n\nThe quick and easy to follow recipes are by New York Times bestselling author George Bryant of civilizedcavemancooking.com. After decades in a constant battle with his weight and nearly losing both his legs while on deployment as a U.S. Marine, George decided to change his life. He went Paleo. What started as a simple website to share recipes with friends, has since grown into an award-winning food blog. After being in the Marines for 12 years, George now enjoys creating delicious Paleo recipes full-time, hoping to change as many lives as he can with real food recipes.\n\nGeorge works in collaboration with Abel James from the chart topping podcast \"The Fat-Burning Man show\" where he covers the Paleo lifestyle. Abel has been featured in Men's Health, Popular Science and Wired Magazine. You'll find exclusive content from Abel inside the app.\n\nNote: For users upgrading\nCaveman Feast 3.0 is available as a free update on iOS 9.3 and above.

      "label": "Sugar is in everything these days, from boxed cereals to pasta sauces; it's almost impossible to avoid unless you're eating a real food diet. The 7 Day Sugar-Free Detox was designed by the Young and Raw team of expert nutritionists and holistic health coaches to create a fun and cleansing experience for you while you break free from the chains of sugar. \n\nStudies show sugar can be highly addictive, so rest assured we've got your back when it comes to kicking it for good! Inside this detox, you're going to find two meal plans to choose from. Our Low-Sugar Plan has small amounts of natural sugar found in fruits. Our No-Sugar Plan is completely sugar free.\n\nRefined or processed sugar is incomplete in its nutrient profile, lacking minerals and vitamins required by our bodies for digestion. What ends up happening when we eat sugar, is our bodies have to seek out the proper minerals required for digestion and unfortunately, those minerals are \"borrowed\" from our mineral reserves. This can lead to mineral deficiency and other health issues that are today, considered \"modern diseases\". \n\nThe 7 Day Sugar Free Detox is designed to support:\n- Breaking sugar addiction\n- Weight loss\n- Liver & Kidney detox\n- Skin health \n- Balancing blood sugar \n- Mood balancing\n- Energy levels\n- Adrenal fatigue\n\nInside the 7 Day Sugar Free Detox you will find:\n- Low-Sugar Meal Plan which includes some fruit sugars\n- No-Sugar Meal Plan which is 100% sugar free\n- Recipes - along with a list of health benefits for each recipe\n- Shopping lists - to make shopping quick and easy, you can tick off items from the list\n- Morning and evening routines - including how to get a perfect night of sleep\n- Young and Raw's favorite books, quotes & documentaries\n- Frequently Asked Questions\n\nHow does the plan work to reset the body?\nThe 7 Day Sugar Free Detox was carefully crafted by experts to get you results while maintaining your sanity throughout the process! \n\nBy replacing sugar with fresh leafy greens, vegetables, seaweeds and seeds along with an abundance of healthy fats, your body will be less hungry for sugar. In the beginning, you may notice a withdrawal period as your body adjusts to running off of fat and real food rather than sugar and carbohydrates. Be patient with yourself throughout this process, it's not easy, but we know you can do it!\n\nThe meal plans have everything you need to detox, and because there are no added or refined sugars your liver and kidneys will get a much needed break from processed sugar.\n\nFor 7 days you're going to experience what it's like to enjoy only real, whole foods but don't forget that diet is only one part of the equation. Proper detox also includes getting enough fresh clean water and optimizing your sleep. Our sleep cycles ensure the body gets its time to effectively detox, renew and heal. The included sleep protocol was designed based on all of the information we have about the importance of optimized sleep and the experiments we have done, to create a protocol that really works. \n\nYour herbal protocol is always optional and if you're on any medications, pregnant or have a health condition, it's advised that you speak with your physician and consult an herbalist prior to taking new supplements. The herbal protocol is minimal yet powerful, including some of the most elite herbs for detoxing the liver, kidneys, creating clear skin and boosting energy in the process. \n\nIn Summary, the 7 Day Sugar Free Detox helps to reset the body by:\n- Gently cleansing the body and promoting toxin elimination\n- Gently introducing blood cleansing foods\n- Providing the body with enough healthy fats to begin removing a reliance upon sugar and processed carbohydrates\n- Encouraging a healthy sleep cycle \n- Creates a movement routine to stimulate the lymphatic system, the endocrine system and the detox organs\n- Hydrating effectively to flush the body of excess toxins and create electrolyte balance"

These products grab onto the impurities and make it easier to catch them in the filters, though there are many animal-free alternatives in use.\n\nThe Drink Green Vegan Alcohol Directory powered by Barnivore is here to help.\n\nThese ingredients don't usually show up on the label, so the only way to find out is to ask.\n\nOur 20,059 entries have been checked and often double or triple checked by the Barnivore community and are gathered here for you to enjoy."

After water and tea, it is the most popular drink in the world, and it is at the center of a $450 billion industry. \n\nEdited by Garrett Oliver, the James Beard Winner for Outstanding Wine, Beer, or Spirits Professional, this is the first major reference work to investigate the history and vast scope of beer. The Oxford Companion to Beer features more than 1,100 A-Z entries written by 166 of the world's most prominent beer experts. Attractively illustrated with over 140 images, the book covers everything from the agricultural makeup of various beers to the technical elements of the brewing process, local effects of brewing on regions around the world, and the social and political implications of sharing a beer. Entries not only define terms such as \"dry hopping\" and \"cask conditioning\" but give fascinating details about how these and other techniques affect a beer's taste, texture, and popularity. Cultural entries shed light on such topics as pub games, food pairings and the development of beer styles. Readers will enjoy vivid accounts of how our drinking traditions have changed throughout history, and how these traditions vary in different parts of the world, from Japan to Mexico, New Zealand, and Brazil, among many other countries. The pioneers of beer-making are the subjects of biographical entries, and the legacies these pioneers have left behind, in the form of the world's most popular beers and breweries, are recurrent themes throughout the book."

      "label": "iBrewer is an application with many useful tools, ingredients, formulas and functionalities for who wants to brew his own handcrafted beer, whatever the brewing method. An application for homebrewers made by homebrewers.\n\nThe new version of iBrewer also provides a list of Pre-loaded Recipes that can be  consulted and added to the Personal Recipes list. Furthermore, it is possible to select the reference Style, selecting it from more than 70 different styles, and compare its parameters with those of your own Recipe.\n********\nAll-Grain and Extract brewing method\n\n1. Preparation of the recipe\nIt is possible to choose from a list of over 450 ingredients for your recipe. You can also add new custom ingredients if they are not on the list.\nDuring the preparation of the recipe important parameters are provided, such as original gravity (OG), IBU and SRM. The app predicts alcohol content and beer color thanks to an algorithm with more than 240 different color gradations.\n\n2. Production\nIt’s devided in 6 parts:\n\n- Mashing: the app automatically sets the timer that alerts the homebrewer 1 minute before the end of the step, so he can prepare for the next one.\n\n- Filtering: the app provides a stime of the volume of wort remained in grains according to the recipe parameters\n\n- Pre-Boiling: calculation of the actual value of sugar extraction efficiency\n\n- Boiling: based on hops and spices the app automatically sets the timer that alerts the homebrewer 1 minute before the insertion of the specific ingredient\n\n- Fermenter: you can get the characteristics of wort when diluted in water and write down your Dry-Hopping\n\n- Yeast pitching: the app gives you the minimum recommended quantity of yeast, based on recipe properties and kind of fermentation\n\n3. Additional features\nFor each stage of your recipe you can take pictures and write notes, so you get an overview of each brewing part. Your beers will always get better !\n\n\n4. Fermentation\nDuring wort fermentation process it is possible to take note of wort density and temperature. The app alerts you when the correct predicted density has been reached or exceeded.\n\n5. Bottling\nYou can calculate the effective alcohol value of your beer, based on wort final gravity value. With the tool “Carbonation” it is also possible to calculate the exact amount of sugar needed for the priming phase.\n\n6. Tasting\nBased on specific parameters you can evaluate your own beer (from 1 to 5 stars).\n\n7. Overview Recipe\nIn one screen you can view all the significant data of your recipe, all the ingredients listed and all notes divided per phase. You can also email the complete record of your recipe.\n**********\nKIT Brewing Method\n\nThe Homebrewer who adopts the Kit method can use this apposite section with the same tools of “Recipes” section with the guide functionality added in each screen. This guide gives the basic necessary informations to define your recipe and brew your beer with iBrewer, in a step by step path.\n**********\nARCHIVE\n\nIn a single screen you can get an overview of all your submitted recipes, from which you can view the main features in an easy and intuitive way.\n\n**********\nTOOLS\n\nThe Homebrewer can use important tools at any time :\n\n- Densimeter: it corrects the measured density in function of temperature\n- Dilution: it calculates the values of diluted wort\n- Carbonation: it calculates the required amount of sugar for carbonation\n- Alcohol: it calculates the alcohol content of your beer\n- Color: it calculates the color of your beer, based on more than 240 different color gradations\n- Timer: it makes the countdown based on the value set by the user\n- Unit of measurement: choose from International System and US Customary Units\n- Scale Recipe: change the recipe volume, iBrewer recalculates all others quantities proportionally\n\n\nEdited by:\nTheory: Francesco Casellato\nCode developers: Giulio Mollica, Stefano Mutta"

Have you been looking on the App Store for something like this for a while?  Then you’re like me, and this is the tool for you!\n\nPizza and bread dough recipes can use Baker's Percentages.  Baker's Percentages are used to make more consistent recipes by specifying the ratios of the ingredient masses.  One cup of sifted flour does not weigh the same as one cup of unsifted flour.  But 100g of flour will always be 100g of flour.  Baker's Percentages are also easy to scale to different dough ball sizes.\n\nWith this app you can include up to 8 ingredients in your recipes.  You can also save your favorite recipes for future reference.  The ingredients list is customizable so you can add detail about your ingredients.  For example, if your recipe calls for Instant Dry Yeast instead of Active Dry Yeast then you can include that.\n\nAdditionally, if you know the masses of your ingredients, you can also use this tool to convert your recipe into Baker's Percentages for easy scaling to different sizes.\n\nYou can also add notes for reference that will be saved with each recipe.\n\nSupports ounces and grams."

      "label": "Catador replicates the industry standard SCAA coffee cupping scoresheet with an easy-to-use system of sliders to rate sensory criteria and tick boxes to mark off-cups in the categories of Uniformity, Clean Cup and Sweetness. \n\nTouching the Notes line launches a virtual keyboard so that you can record your comments and total scores are tallied immediately and accurately on the right hand side in the Total Score box. So simple, and yet it works perfectly.\n\nCatador goes further to include administrative features that make it even more useful in the field.\n\nFrom the Home screen, you can add and delete cupping flights, identifying the number of samples in each group, which are given generic alphabetic labels or numbers that can be given unique names. (Both Arabica and Robusta are available)\n\nAfter the day’s cupping is done (or when asked to turn in your Q Grader cupping evaluation), users can also permanently lock each flight so that it cannot be changed later. The system gives you a popup warning that the operation cannot be undone.\n\nNo cupping scoresheet application can be fully functional in the real world unless you have some way to export the data. Catador presently includes an email function that sends scores as a text document to any email address, as well as a .CSV file which may be imported into other applications or a worksheet. \n\nThere is also an Airprint option, where you may print the output to any Airprint enabled printer wirelessly.\n\nOn the latest version, you may also share your sessions using the Airdrop feature on all supported iOS devices."

You use a simple interface to plan out meals like “Hamburgers on Thursday, Fish and Rice on Friday”. Recent meals are easily available or you can type in new items the first time you use them.\n\nMealPlan is a universal app, and will sync between your iPhone and iPad using either iCloud or Dropbox. Plan your meals on the iPad's big screen, and automatically have your grocery list with you on your phone. And access your grocery list from your Apple Watch.\n\nMealPlan creates your grocery list as you're planning meals. When you're done, tap the Grocery Basket to see the list, add new items, mark off items you already have, and then print it, email it, or sync it with your iPhone. This is a huge time saver!\n\nAnd, on the iPad, once you’ve used the app for a few weeks, the Magic Wand will help you quickly fill out subsequent weeks, with a quick suggestions interface.\n\nFeatures include:\n- Simple interface to plan out meals.\n- Keep track of recipes and the groceries they use.\n- Automatically generated grocery list based on your meal plan.\n- Save grocery lists for later use (think \"Party\" or \"Camping\").\n- Save a week's planned meals as a template to reuse.\n- Combined search/add box makes it easy to add new items.\n- Print out a week's plan to any AirPrint printer.\n- Configure your own meals: Add snacks, or remove breakfast if you don't want to plan it.\n- Email a plain text summary of the week's plan.\n- Add a note to any meal item, including clickable links.\n- Dropbox sync for families with multiple devices and accounts.\n- Use Siri for groceries: \"Add Milk to my Grocery List\".\n\n\"Before MealPlan, I’d buy food at the grocery store and then forget I had it .. a few days later it would go to waste. A few minutes every week standing in front of the fridge with MealPlan in hand will help you get the most out of what you have on hand. Plan it, print it out and stick it to your fridge!\"\n\nVisit the website for more information, and a detailed walkthrough of what MealPlan can do."

Then you probably own a circulator or a similar device. To start, a zip-bag, a cooking pot and a thermometer is all you need. Many Sous Vide recipes work without special equipment. But you will need good advice!\n\nSous Vide has been adopted in professional kitchens for producing precise and consistent results. The Sous Vide method produces perfectly cooked food with outstanding flavor. Its success in high-end cuisine changed the culinary world. With a few starting tips anyone can use this technique. Step-by-step tutorials and Sous Vide timers (mini-recipes with an alarm) help you along the way.\n\nIdeas, suggestions or anything you would like to change? Contact us with your feedback on UserVoice!\n\nThe time for a piece of meat to reach a core temperature can be calculated. A formula using thermal diffusivity, thermal conductivity and surface heat transfer calculates the time such shapes as cylinders, cubes and steaks need to acquire a certain core temperature. Consider the PolyScience Toolbox App or Douglas Baldwin’s formulas for calculating pasteurization times.\n\nBut food is never an exact geometrical shape and waiting for an extra hour for a piece to reach an additional half a degree is impractical. Adjustments for speed and efficiency improve the Sous Vide experience. We have tested Sous Vide recommendations that work and tutorials that make the first steps easy - for professionals and home cooks alike!\n\nSous Vide - no other cooking method gives you so much control!\n\nDon’t get the Anova Pro or the new Anova Precision Cooker (2019) as these devices are no longer equipped with Bluetooth!"

In order to know what’s behind a “Lubina” on a Spanish menu, all you need is to whip out your iPhone.\n\nFOOD ENCYCLOPEDIA AND SHOPPING ASSISTANCE\nFor every entry, the App provides at least one photo, evaluates culinary quality and indicates the scientific name, if applicable. In the description, the most important and relevant culinary information is summarized all in one place, and is followed by hints to uses in cuisine and its processing and preparation – without the App actually intending to be a cookbook. \n\nTRANSLATION ASSISTANCE ABROAD\nTravelers mostly enjoy that all the food names are simultaneously given in five languages – English, French, German, Spanish and Italian. Thus, it is possible to translate menus abroad, to ask about a specific fish on a Spanish market or to look up whether Banon cheese from the cheese menu in a restaurant is made with raw milk or not. \n\nSEARCH BY KEYWORD OR CHAPTER\nThe Food Guide can be perused by individual ingredients, but is also organized into 21 categories such as “Fish”, “Vegetables and Legumes”, “Herbs and Seasonings”, “Cheese”, “Seafood” and “Sausages and Ham”, to name just a few.\n\nFAVORITES FUNCTION\nInteresting findings can be transferred into an App-specific favorites list with just the touch of a finger. That way, they can quickly be found again at any time.\n\nRUNS OFFLINE\nIt is not necessary to have an Internet or a telephone connection to run the App. You will always have full access to all of the information, regardless of whether you find yourself on the beach on the Bahamas, in a Spanish mountain village or in a delicatessen in Paris.\n \nFood Guide Features:\n• Extremely attractive, easy to use interface\n• Multilingual dictionary with 2,000 food products and ingredients\n• Each entry accompanied by at least one highres picture of the product\n• More than 2,500 high quality pictures\n• Scientific names included in descriptions\n• Offers product knowledge and consumer information\n• App has 21 comprehensive chapters\n• Shows 1-5 star rating of enjoyment level \n• Versatile search functions\n• ‘Favorites’ feature lets you bookmark products that you want to return to"

      "label": "The food drink combination has a profound effect on your overall experience, either good or bad. If paired correctly, your drink will compliment your food and add to your enjoyment. \nWe used the experience gained running delipair.com food-wine pairing website since 2015 to create ‘Delipair - Food and Wine’. Thanks to the advances in Machine Intelligence and increase of processing power available for mobile devices we were able to create an offline application more robust and versatile than server based solution behind delipair.com website.\n\nDelipair's digital sommelier engine automatically makes recommendation by creating aromatic fingerprint for your food and assessing the strength of aromatic bridge between food and each wine it knows.\n\nTo create food aromatic fingerprint Delipair's digital sommelier uses knowledge gained through (machine) learning ingredients and aromatic molecules of 1.3 million recipes from cuisines all around the world. That way you can simply enter a dish name straight from the restaurant menu or online cooking website and Delipair's digital sommelier will decipher its aromatic fingerprint. It works with ingredient names, or mix of dish names and ingredients as well.\n\nAromatic fingerprints of wines were developed in our laboratory, by scientific analysis of hundreds of wines fitting wine profiles reflecting multiple grape varieties, vinification methods and terroirs of wine regions. For this analysis we used gas chromatography (and we had more fun then scientists from CSI movies doing this).\n\nBased on our research of online wine shops we created a list of profiles to cover most popular wines on the market, and added a few odd but interesting wines we loved the most.\n\nGrape varieties available in Delipair:\n(in alphabetical order, application version 1.2)\n\nCabernet Sauvignon, Carmernere, Chardonnay, Chenin Blanc, Corvina, Gamay, Grenache, Merlot, Malbec, Molinara, Nebbiolo, Nero d’Avola, Pinot Gris, Pinot Noir, Primitivo, Riesling, Rondinella, Sangiovese, Sauvignon Blanc, Shiraz, Syrah, Tempranillo, Viognier, Zinfandel. \n\nWine countries available in Delipair:\n(in alphabetical order, application version 1.2)\n\nArgentina, Australia, Chile, France, Italy, Germany, New Zealand, South Africa, Spain, USA\n\nTraditional wine types and regions available in Delipair:\n(in alphabetical order, application version 1.2)\n\nAmarone, Barbaresco, Barolo, Beaujolais (Villages, Cru), Bolgheri (Super Tuscans), Bordeaux (Left Bank), Bordeaux (Right Bank), Brunello di Montalcino, Chablis, Chianti (Classico, Riserva), Cote d’Or, Cotes du Rhone, Passo Doble, Pouilly Fuisse, Pouilly Fume, Petit Chablis, Prosecco, Rioja (Joven, Crianza, Reserva, Gran Reserva), Spatlese (Riesling), Valpolicella (Classico, Ripasso), Vino Nobile de Montepulciano\n\nIt was our goal to make Delipair's digital sommelier as easy and friendly to use as possible. This application works 100% offline. Therefore you can get the recommendation instantly, without the need of WiFi or cellular data plan and without waiting for a server to respond. \n\nWe also value your privacy, therefore we don't collect any data you enter into our application. \n\nLast, but not least, when you buy 'Delipair - Food and Wine' application you instantly get access to all the features and future updates.\n\nWe do hope our application will enhance your dining experience. Cheers!"

We used the rule of thumb that women need 2000 calories and men need 2400 calories per normal day and on a Fast Day you should eat a quarter of a normal day’s recommended calories.\n\nBut these normal values are just estimates, to get the maximum out of the 5:2 Fast Diet you should consume a quarter of the calories needed to maintain your particular weight. This value is different for each person because it takes into account your gender, age, weight, height & normal activity level.\n\nOur calculator app will allow you to more accurately work out your Rest Day Calorie Intake and therefore your more accurate Fast Day intake."

But for many people it is difficult to take that much every day.\nFor all those people, smoothies are a great solution.\n\nThe app indicates, for each smoothie and for each individual fruit, the percentage of the recommended daily intake (RDI) it contains, of the most important vitamins and minerals.\n\nSometimes it is difficult to choose a smoothie from the wide selection. Therefore, the app helps you, by letting you choose a smoothie in several ways:\n\n- Per fruit. You can choose from 20 different fruits.\n\n- Fruits can be classified by their color.\nEach color contains different important vitamins, minerals and bioactive substances.\nTo ensure your intake of nutrients is as varied as possible, the app divides the smoothies in different colors.\n\n- The app indicates, for a large number of diseases and conditions, which fruits, and therefore smoothies, are beneficial in their prevention.\n\n- The smoothies can also be selected by whether they contain dairy products or not and by calories.\n\nThis app is available in English, Spanish, Dutch, Italian, Japanese and Chinese.\n\nThere is plenty of choice!"

I Love it :)\"\n- Jasmine Ogana\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nThe only thing that matters when it comes to diet plans is if it works!\n\nBased on over 20 years of research the Dukan Diet is one of the most popular books and diet plans in France. It is a protein-based diet designed by French nutritionist and dietician, Pierre Dukan.\n\nThe diet consists of 4 phases: attack, cruise, consolidation, and stabilization.\n\nThe attack phase is designed to enable dieters to rapidly lose 2 to 3 kilograms (4.4 to 6.6 lb) in 2–7 days by kick-starting their metabolism. Dieters are allowed to eat as much as they want of 72 protein-rich foods.\n\nThe cruise phase is designed to allow dieters to more gradually achieve the weight they aim for by eating protein-rich foods with the addition of 28 specific vegetables. \n\nThe consolidation phase is designed to help in preventing any future massive weight gain. During this phase, fruit, bread, cheese and starchy foods are reintroduced into a normal diet, leaving two celebratory meals a week as directed by the plan.\n\nFinally, in the stabilization phase, dieters can essentially eat whatever they want without gaining weight by following a few lifestyle rules: protein day once a week, eating oat bran every day and making a fitness commitment to \"take the stairs\". Dieters should follow this last phase for the rest of their life to avoid regaining weight.\n\n- Features an elegant and intuitive interface\n\n- Over 300 dukan food recipes\n\n- Recipes for all meal types including: breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack\n\n- Star your favorites for easy reference\n\n- Filter menu to sort\n\n- Search feature to quickly find your favorite recipe\n\nDownload Dukan Diet Pro and start feeling healthier today!"

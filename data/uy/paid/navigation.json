      "label": "Ship Finder shows live moving ships on a worldwide map. The intuitive design combined with incredible performance puts you in control. Watch in full screen, view in AR, search, add filters and so much more!\n\nShip Finder has been top rated and top ranking since 2009 and covers most of the world, tracking 20,000+ ships simultaneously.\n\nOur incredible app performance means that you can see all tracked vessels at once - no clustering here!\nSimply tap a ship to see its name, type, photos, speed, dimensions and much more.\nPowerful features such as filters, search and the ability to save favourite ships are included. (You can choose Apple or Google maps too!).\n\nAdd and browse bookmarks to saved locations around the globe to quickly navigate to areas or ports of interest.\n\nYou can even use Augmented Reality (AR) view to identify ships out at sea using your device camera. \n\nShip Finder works by picking up AIS ship feeds used by all passenger vessels, vessels over 300 tons and increasingly by smaller pleasure craft and yachts. This technology is actually faster than radar and is used by vessels for safety and navigation.\n\nShip Finder provides near real time “virtual radar” AIS maps. It’s easy to use and is an amazing app for anyone interested in shipping, cruising and sailing in ports and locations across the world. It’s also great if you simply want to know what boats are out there or want to see where your friends and family are. Ship Finder is also used extensively by maritime professionals and mariners.\n\nOur global AIS coverage is impressive and expanding all of the time as we add new AIS feeds and receivers. Please check www.shipfinder.co regularly to see the latest coverage.\n\nPinkfroot are committed to customer service and continually improve our Ship Finder apps based on feedback. Why not join our online community at www.pinkfroot.com or if you have any questions please email us via support@pinkfroot.com and we’ll be happy to help. \n\nDisclaimer: Ship Finder should not be used for navigational purposes. \nUnder no circumstances will the developer of this application be held responsible for incidents resulting from the use of the data or its interpretation."

      "label": "A high quality Speedometer, GPS tracker and trip cost monitor for iPhones and cellular iPads. \n∙∙ When you go over a preset speed limit, the large digits change colour from green to red and the device emits a loud sound to alert you! \n∙∙ The cost monitor shows you the current cost of the journey as you drive and tells you each passengers share. \n∙∙ GPS tracker records your trips so they can be analyzed, viewed and shared at any moment.\n\n‣‣ COST MONITOR. What's the cost of my driving?\nBased on gas price for a gallon or litre, MPG (U.S. or UK) or liters per 100 km the app will tell you what the cost is as you drive. You can add an extra cost per kilometer or mile! Useful for all cost aware drivers and for splitting the cost between passengers.\n\n‣‣ GPS TRACKING. Where I've been? How long did it take to get from A to B? \nSpeedometer records your trip statistics even when GPS tracker is switched off. When you need point by point data to see on the map later or export (Google Earth and GPX), speedometer gives you the first class GPS tracker.\n\n‣‣ INFOTAINMENT. \nWhen switched on, infotainment shows trip stats or weather/wind forecast  when you wait. Way better than just showing you a 0 speed!\n\n‣‣ Easy to set speed limits and SPEED LIMIT MEMORY option\nSet speed limits with 4 or 8 fast and configurable presets. Presets only need a single tap and are the safest way to set the limits! With SPEED LIMIT MEMORY you just apply the speed limit once and the app applies it for you automatically the next time!\n\n‣‣ MODES\nUse MENU>MODES to turn the app into a Rally computer, G-Force monitor, Camera alerter or taximeter! Currently there are 12 modes available and we are constantly adding new ones.\n\n‣‣ WAYPOINTS.\nSpeedometer gives you the unique way to leave a note with location and even optional photo or audio note attached! As easy as double tap on the big speed digits! You'll find more in a documentation section (star button).\n\n‣‣ RED LIGHT & SPEED CAMERAS\nImport camera data into speedometer in Garmin or iGO csv formats from poi-factory.com, scdb.info or poi-plaza and let speedo alert you on a camera approach and set speed limit automatically before you pass the speed camera!\n\n‣‣ SUNSET/SUNRISE\nWith the sunset and sunrise information that our speedometer provides, you'll be able to avoid driving in the dusk.\n\n‣‣ BARO VSI. Barometric Vertical Speed Indicator (VSI, IVSI) in both scale and graph forms.\n\n‣‣ VOICE COACH. When enabled and configured, voice coach will be telling you active track distance and duration as well as current speed and altitude.\n\n‣‣ MAPS. Google's native, Apple map, Blank map and Offline maps.\n\n‣‣ Siri shortcuts: New Track, Stop Track, Speed limits.\n\n+ UNIVERSAL APP. Speedometer for iPhone and cellular iPads. All in retina graphics.\n\n+ 000-999 SPEED AND LIMIT RANGE. MPH, KM/H AND KNOTS. Maximum/TOP, average speed, distance traveled.\n\n+ BACKGROUND MODE! Speedometer will work in background if told so and will still warn you with audio alert when exceed a preset speed limit. You can use other apps while speedometer does its job in the background!\n\n+ PRIVACY. Speedometer never shares your location data with 3rd parties or ad agencies. Location data is used solely for tracking your speed and recording the GPS tracks and never leave the app unless you decide to share by means of a track export. It always let you know when background mode is on and never runs in background unless it is explicitly told to do so.\n\n! You can use this app on your iPhone as well as on any cellular iPad. **App will not work properly on iPods and wifi only iPads as they don't have GPS (external GPS module is required). \n! Please note that as with all GPS apps, continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nDrive safely, keep the log and notes and avoid paying those speeding fines! Our speedometer is the ideal companion no matter what journey you are going on!"

      "label": "Theodolite is a multi-function viewfinder that combines a compass, two-axis inclinometer, rangefinder, GPS, map, nav calculator, and geo-overlay photo/movie camera into one indispensable app. Theodolite was one of the very first augmented reality (AR) apps when it was released in 2009, and it’s been downloaded and used by millions of customers since then. Uses are endless, and the app is great for land measurements, outdoor sports, sightseeing, navigation, and finding your way around. Theodolite is a pro grade app and is used extensively by surveyors, geologists, architects, engineers, competitive sportsmen, first responders, military personnel, and search and rescue workers around the world. \n\nTheodolite lets you take data-overlay photos and movies with 2X-8X zoom. Overlay geographical data, angle markings, date/time, author/company info, and project notes directly on photos and movies for later reference. The same data is written into the metadata record of images, making image files self-contained data records. Third-party apps can tap into Theodolite's advanced camera functions with a camera sharing feature.\n\nView current position on the built-in map with optional offline Outdoors maps that include topo contours, roads, trails, landmarks, campgrounds, ski lifts, and more. Live map markers continually update distance/heading relative to the current location and also show wayfinding info in the main viewfinder. Draw polygons on the map to mark things like property boundaries and trails, and import/export polygon data via KML.\n\nShare map markers and nav calculator points with other users of Theodolite via text messages or e-mail. This powerful capability opens up a wide range of collaborative uses including team land surveying, accident investigations, spotting wild fires, triangulation of landmarks, and advanced tactical observation and targeting. With an optional in-app purchase to enable team tracking, you can share location with up to 20 people on Theodolite's map.\n\nTheodolite includes features for serious users like a reference angle mode, nav calculator, map marker import/export, manual and automatic data logging with CSV and KML export, clipboard integration, %grade display, mil compass readout, optical rangefinders (including a mil-based reticle, sniper-style stadiametric graphs, and a variable 4X-24X scope), and night filters to improve use in dark conditions.\n\nTheodolite can provide location in military grid reference system (MGRS) coordinates, Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates, British/Irish National Grids, US National Grid, Maidenhead locator system, Map Grid of Australia, and six latitude/longitude formats. Optional US State Plane coordinates include SPCS27 and SPCS83 zones covering all US States. The optional Datum Pack adds over 230 geodetic datums to the app to improve position computation from GPS data, covering regions and countries on all continents around the world.\n\nAR Layers include navigational aids like the sun, moon, planets, and Polaris (North star), and the optional US Mountain Summits layer that shows over 70,000 US mountain summits in the viewfinder.\n\nTheodolite has been shown in Apple Keynotes, featured on the App Store, and has been a #1 selling Navigation app in App Stores around the world. Since its introduction in 2009, Theodolite has defined augmented reality navigation. The app continually introduces new technologies, pushing the limits of iOS app development and taking advantage of new hardware capabilities.\n\nFind out why Apple named Theodolite one of the most amazing apps available and showed it being used to explore the Great Wall of China. Where will you take it on your next adventure?\n\nNote: Theodolite is an iPhone app -- see “Theodolite HD” for use on an iPad. And be sure to check out the all-new \"Theodolite for Watch\" and put Theodolite on your wrist!"

      "label": "What is WikiFarms Australia?\n\nWikiFarms Australia is the essential application for backpackers looking for a farm job in Australia. Whether you are looking for a casual job during your trip or aiming to complete your 88 days of farm work to get your Second Year Visa, WikiFarms Australia will be your guide!\nThe application will help you to be in direct contact with farmers by making available a map with thousands of farms around Australia!\nThe database is always growing and constantly being updated by our team: companies are added weekly, contacts are regularly verified, making it the largest database for fruit picking jobs in Australia! With more than 2000 companies listed in the app you’ll have all the information you need to find a farm job quickly.\n\n \nSo do not wait to get the best farm job tool available in Australia!\n\n \nWhat can I do with the app?\n\nWikiFarms Australia makes it easy to find a farm. Simply use the map screen to see exactly where are located the farms. Then tap a site to bring up its description. It will show you the name of the company, type of crops, phone number, and, for some of them, website and email. You can then call the farmers directly from the app and ask them if they need workers. If you are ready to go, you can also start an itinerary from your current location and ask them in person!\n\nThe app also allows you to use filters. If you are looking to work in a specific area or to pick a specific type of fruit during a specific time, you can do that!\n\nThe app lists also tons of working hostels, tourism offices, working agencies that can give you more information or help to find a job in a specific area.\n\nWith the app you can also calculate your 88 days of farm work easily and see if you’re ready to apply for the Second (or Third soon!) Year Visa.\n\n \nWho made WikiFarms Australia?\n\nFellow backpackers like you created WikiFarms Australia! When we were looking for farm work to get our Second Year Visa, we really struggled knowing where to look for farms! There was some information here and there but nothing really consistent. This is when we started to think about a tool that will have all the farmers at once and WikiFarms Australia started just like that J\n\n \nWhy is the app not free?\n\nWe are a very small team working on this project for more than 2 years! As a result, the profit of the app really helps us to make it better day after day. In addition, it also contributes to our travelling passion (which we are sure that if you are here you can relate!)\n\nIn addition, you certainly think that most apps are free, but are they really? Most of the time, free apps are full of unwanted and annoying ads and you often have to pay more to have the full use of it.\n\nWe made the choice to offer a complete, advertising-free experience for as low of a price as we could make it. Consider that half the price you pay for it goes to taxes and Google share.\n\nThe application helps you get what you need the most, find a farm job, and when you will get it, its price will be covered in less than half an hour of work!\n\nThanks for your purchase and we hope that you’ll have a good experience with our app!\n\n \nFeel free to join us on our Facebook page or to visit our website:\nhttps://wikifarmsaustralia.com/\n\n \nAre you a farmer looking for workers? You can contact us at: info.wikifarms@gmail.com\nWe will answer you within 24h."

      "label": "“Awesome!!! The best speed app on iphone” 5 Stars by kurtonic\n\nSpeed Box is a Speedometer and GPS app for both your iPhone and iPad. It displays your current speed, distance, direction and altitude along with your top speed and average speed. The app also keeps a record of the speed and altitude for the last few hours.\n\n\nMAIN FEATURES\n========================\n\n* MPH, KM/H and KNOTS\n* Show decimal speed (e.g. \"45.7 mph\")\n* One app for both the iPhone and iPad\n* \"Speak speed\" - Tap screen to have the speed spoken to you\n* 11 Analog and digital speedometers\n* Map view\n* Maximum and average speed\n* Altitude \n* Digital compass \n* HUD display to see speed in windshield \n* Odometer to measure distance traveled \n* Chart of the traveled speed and altitude \n* Warning signal when driving too fast \n* Export last 3 hours of data \n* Change maximum displayed speed on speedometer \n* Swipe finger over chart to display historic data \n* Display GPS accuracy by tapping the indicator in the top left corner \n\n\nUSER REVIEWS\n========================\n\n5 Stars by Darekakuta \n\"Just what I needed. My '58 chev's speedo doesn't work. This did the trick.\" \n\n5 Stars by Rawd \n\"Great My 79 Firebird speedo only goes to 140 kmh. ;). This worked perfectly.\" \n\n5 Stars \n\"Within 1 mile per hour +/- Great Job!\" \n\nSpeedBox was one of the very early Speedometer Apps for the iPhone. Take advantage of my experience and the refined algorithms that can get a much greater accuracy from the iPhone then a lot of other apps. I regularly update my application to make it even more accurate and usable. \n\nUsers have already used our application to verify the accuracy of their car's speedometer or they tried measuring the speed they achieved while skiing. Can you come up with more ideas? How about measuring the speed of the airplane you travel with? \n\nUSAGE NOTES\n========================\nThe \"GPS strength\" indicator in the top left corner should display a green dot. You can tap this indicator to display the current GPS accuracy.\n\nPlease allow the application up to a minute to find enough satellites to work correctly. \n\nIf you get a message to enable GSP, please go to ”Settings > General > Location Services“ on your iPhone and check if the little switch is set to \"On\" for Speed Box as well as for \"Location Services\" in general. \n\nATTENTION iPod touch users! Unfortunately this app doesn't work very well on the iPod touch and the iPad WiFI (without 3G) since these devices are missing a GPS!\n\n\nFEEDBACK\n========================\nIf you've got any wishes or suggestions for new features, please let me know with the contact form on this application's website (see link below).\n\nI am already working on the next update!"

Organise them in mosaics and favourites. \n   · Zoom in to see gas stations with their prices, cameras and speed cams\n\n- GAS PRICE:\n   · Find gas stations on the “Traffic Map” (zoom in) or in “Routes” (they are ordered by price in each route you have created)\n   · Prices updated every minute\n   · Tap and hold for a second on the “Traffic Map” to find nearby gas stations ordered by price.\n   · Configure in settings how much you would like to deviate from your route to find cheap gas (cheap gas stations aren’t placed in main roads), a second gas type, and with how much zoom they are shown on the “Traffic Map”\n   · Create your gas station favourite list to check their prices easily\n\n- MORE:\n   · Choose the tab where the app is initiated according to what you use more: Warner, Traffic Map, or Routes.\n   · Warn your friends of problems in the road via WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, e-mail, iMessage,…\n   · Traffic Alarms to remember checking the traffic and avoid traffic jams\n\n- The paid version (the “pro”) includes everything, it doesn’t have ads or in-app purchases. The free one has one in-app purchase which enables the automatic update of speed cams (the speed of speed cams is not shown on the Watch without this in-app purchase, although a general warning is given), enables CarPlay, removes the ads, and allows to chose dark/light mode independently of the iPhone settings. If you buy it, you would have the same functionality of the paid version.\n\nNOTES:\n\n- To use the Warner you need your device to have a GPS integrated: all iPhones have it, iPod and iPad WiFi do NOT have it (iPad 3G DOES have it). The rest of the functionality (routes, traffic, gas price) works in any device.\n\nATTENTION! The Speed Cam Warner uses your GPS. Continuos use of the warner in fore or background can drain your battery quickly."

Following these cycles can help you get a stronger connection with nature around you and become conscious of your essence.\n\nThis app provides a simple way to sync along those cycles, to raise our frequency and give us a new lens to view both our day-to-day and planetary events.\n\n- Did you ever realize that our (Gregorian) calendar is not a harmonic calendar? \n- Did you know that the moon has 13 (not 12!) orbits around the earth in 1 year? \n- Why do we live with this irregular calendar?\n- Are you interested in Astrology?\n\n-> All this, and more, is explained carefully in this app. (over 15.000 words on 37 pages) Please note that these text are in English language only.\n\nIn the New Time, synchronicity is the norm.\n\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// \n5 star rating across the world! \n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// \n\"Entertaining as well as enlightening\" \n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// \n\nMORE INFO: \nwww.1320sync.com \n\n\nFor the beginner this app is a learning tool because it contains an extensive explanation about Tones and Seals and the synchronizing order of the Mayan Astrology. You may think it's difficult at first but soon you will feel how it all connects. \n\n\"This app is great, and allows easy manipulation of dates. I spent years in books doing in hours what I can now do in seconds.\"\n\nFor the ones who are already familiar with the Mayan Calendar this app is a handy tool to navigate the cycles, and calculate the Combined Kin for any given combination. Furthermore this app can be of great assistance to teach other people about the 13:20 cycles and is used in teachings around the world.\n\n\n=== FEATURES ===\n\n+ Kin Calendar\nThis is your main Mayan Dreamspell Calendar Dashboard with all the details you need to stay in sync. Shows the Kin of today by default, and you can calculate the Kin for any other date.\n\n+ Personal Notes\nOn this new page you can keep your personal notes for the 2 main cycles of time: the Tzolkin cycle of 260 days and the 13 Moon cycle of 365 days. And with the powerful text search function you quickly find your notes.\n\n+ Kin Picker\nSelect any combination of the 13 Tones and 20 Seals. Top section can scroll to 4 pages with information.\n\n+ Combined Kin Calculator \nCalculate the Combined Kin of any combination of Kin. You can add as many Kin as you like to calculate the Combined Kin for a group of people. \n\n+ Tzolkin with indication of the GAP day's and Wavespell and more. Tap and hold to select a Kin number directly.\n\n+ Contact Import \nAll contacts in your Contacts App will be automatically imported and assigned to the correct Kin. See all your contacts with their Mayan Reading and how you relate to them. \n\n+ 13 Moon Calendar \nFull integration of 13 Moon Calendar. (doubles as a birthday calendar!) \n\n+ 13:20 Information \nLots of information about the theory behind synchronization to help you navigate the Mayan Dreamspell Calendar. The texts provide a clear explanation of the Cycles of Time. (More than 15.000 words on 37 pages) Please note that these text are in English language only.\n\n+ Sharing\nOn all the 3 main tabs you can share the current selected Galactic Signature using your favorite app. \n\n\n# Based on the work of José Argüelles.\n# This app was made with permission of and in cooperation with the Foundation for the Law of Time - www.lawoftime.org, \n# Ariel Spilsbury."

      "label": "The first and only Vector Magnetometer on the iPhone - Visualize the hidden world of magnetism around you in 3 dimensions (3GS or later!)! It can be perfectly used to explore and measure the direction and strength of the magnetic field of random objects around you (which can be quite fascinating!). With limitations (see docs) it can be used as a metal detector to find electric lines or pipes in walls (always good to check a wall before drilling in, at least better with this than not to check at all). Another application is to use this tool as a rough estimate of your north-south position on earth without using the GPS(!) - just by measuring the local earth magnetic declination (it works fine even while flying in a plane to check how the declination changes). Or simply explore your next Christmas present before opening it! Send us your results!\n\n\nThe application has four different displays modes to visualize the magnetic field:\n\n- Absolute Mode: Displays the absolute magnetic field in microtesla (μT) measured by the magnetometer.\n\n- North Mode: A compass head-up displays the geographic north along with the pointer that directs to the magnetic north (thus display difference magnetic to geographic north).\n\n- Declination Mode: Two arrows will be displayed to indicate the declination of the earth magnetic field (0° just on equator, increasing to north with blue pointer direction up or south with blue pointer direction down). \n\n- Relative Mode: This mode shows the relative strength (absolute minus compensation vector) of the magnetic field in μT. \n\n\n… and five different display modes for acceleration visualization: \n\n- Absolute Mode: Displays the reverse acceleration of the iPhone (1g up when hold steady). \n\n- X-Rotation - Y-Rotation - Z-Rotation: The arrow will display the rotation around the X-, Y- and Z-Axis of the iPhone. The digital indicator shows the angle numerically (-180° - +180°). A way to calibrate will be added with one of the next updates, so you could use this as a level.\n\n- Relative Mode: This mode shows the relative strength (absolute minus compensation vector) of the acceleration.\n\n\nFor a detailed documentation, please visit our product homepage. \n\n\nFor recreational use only. However it CAN (!) be very accurate. The measurement is performed as good as possible (we try our best) by using the inbuilt accelerometer and magnetometer to their limits. The range of the accelerometer typically has a max of ±3g (~4.2g displayed here if combined) and each magnetometer usually recalibrates internally when over ±120μT in one axis. However, tell us your experience!"

(Except for the alert via email).\n- It is recommended to use the app with the iPhone / iPad plugged in.\n- Setting the map type: map, hybrid or satellite.\n- Setting the GPS accuracy to save battery power.\n- Changing measurement units: meters, feet or fathoms.\n- Alert via email with information regarding dragging distance, position, time, GPS error and battery level.\n- Ability to respond to the alert on your Apple Watch.\n\n\nWARNING\nA continued use of the GPS in the background can dramatically decrease the battery life.\n\nDragAlarm makes use of the GPS antenna. Take into account that not all iOS devices have this inbuilt antenna and therefore this app may not work properly. All iPhones do have the antenna. Only the 3G Cellular iPad with data connection has GPS antenna.\n\n\nDrag Alarm is an app developed by Marinus.\nMarinus, improving the maritime sector.\n\nMarinus Apps\nwww.marinusapps.com"

      "label": "BlindSquare is pioneering accessible navigation both indoors and outdoors. Know where you are, know where you're going, travel with confidence.\n\nBlindSquare is a new solution that combines the latest technology to help the blind with their daily lives. It has been developed in collaboration with blind people and carefully field tested. You need either an iPhone or an iPad to get started. It also supports some additional accessories to enhance the experience. \n\nHow does it work? \n\nBlindSquare uses GPS and the compass to locate you. It then gathers information about the surrounding environment from FourSquare. BlindSquare has some unique algorithms to decide what information is the most relevant and then speaks it to you with high quality speech synthesis. \n“What's the most popular café within 200 meters radius? Where is the post office or the library?” \n\nYou can control BlindSquare also through voice commands. The Voice Command feature is a premium service requiring purchase of credits for continuous use.  Voice Command Credits are available as an in-app purchase on the App Store.\n\nUsing BlindSquare as a GPS solution:\n\nWhen you start the app, it will start telling you the interesting places and street crossings around you. By changing the radius, you can limit the area you are interested in. You can also search by search term or by category. You can select an interesting place from the search results and perform the following tasks:\n\n1) Get contact info (address, phone number) \n2) Open twitter feed or restaurant menu (if provided)\n3) Make a phone call\n4) Start tracking the place (BlindSquare will assist you by repeating the distance and the clock face direction)\n5) Start your favourite navigator for turn-by-turn instructions (TomTom, Navigon or Apple Maps)\n\nBlindSquare is aware of when you travel by car, bus or train and starts to report interesting places in front of you (for example, the next stops) and street crossings when you are passing them.\n\nYou can also save your own private places to iCloud so they will be found with your every device.\n\nUsing BlindSquare as a Foursquare client:\n\nIf you like to play Foursquare, you can do the following with BlindSquare:\n \n1) Get a list of nearby FourSquare venues\n2) When you are in a place, you can check in by shaking your device\n3) Do a check in with commenting and twitter/facebook sharing\n4) Correct the location of the place\n\nBlindSquare supports the following languages: English, Arabic, Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean (South Korea), Norwegian, Polish, Portugues, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish.\n\nVoiceOver usage is supported but it also includes higher quality additional speech synthesis by Acapela Text-To-Speech from Acapela Group.\n \nInstructions in English: https://www.blindsquare.com/user-guide/ and https://www.blindsquare.com/faq/\n\nPlease note: This app retrieves data in real time from Foursquare and Open Street Map. Use of a flat rate data plan is highly recommended.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nHaving only been released in May 2012, BlindSquare has already received several prizes and awards:\n\n - GSMA: Global Mobile Awards 2013, Best Mobile Health Product or Service\n - Apps4Finland 2012\n - OpenCities App Challenge 2012\n - The Finnish Information Processing Association: Best Product 2012\n\nPlease note: To use BlindSquare, your iCloud account has to be active so BlindSquare can access it to save your settings and places.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

      "label": "There are hundreds of gps apps. Do we really need one more?\n\nAriadne GPS is more than a simple gps app.\n\nBesides offering you the possibility to know your position and to get information about the street, the number, etc. it also lets you explore the map of what's around you.\n\nWhat do we mean by saying \"explore\"? You'll deal with a talking map. If you have VoiceOver activated on your device, you will be able to know the street names and numbers that are around you by touching them.\nJust put your finger on the screen of your device, when showing the map and moving it you will be told the info's about the street you're touching.\nYour position is on the center of the screen. What's in front of you is on the top half of the screen and things behind you are on the bottom half of the screen.\n\nYou can also explore a different region than the one around you by telling the app the street and the city.\n\nYou can ask for information about your position at any time, also activating a function, called monitor, that will give you this info periodically (Please read the note below).\nThis app has also got some other useful features that might help when walking or traveling by bus, train etc.\nIf you add your favourite points to the app database, you can be alerted when you get closer than a certain distance to one of them.\n\nThis app is completely accessible using VoiceOver and gives you access to information that are normally unavailable to people using the speech synthesizer and can be therefore especially useful to blind and partially sighted people. \n\nNote: The features of Ariadne GPS are based on the location services and on the Maps server for what concerns the information about the position. This information may not be accurate, due to the location accuracy, which is generally below fifteen metres but in some cases can be few tens of metres and to the Maps service, which might be unresponsive at certain times (Ariadne GPS will tell you if this is the case). The aim of Ariadne GPS is to give you an idea of your position and what is around you. Please do not completely rely on it.\n\nPlease note that the use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nFor more info and suggestions please visit http://www.ariadnegps.eu"

Designed to be used with a Flight Simulator, with the aid of a plugin this application allows you to track your virtual flights in real-time in the palm of your hand, as well as to remotely control your simulated flights. \n\nYou no longer need to stay glued to the computer in order to know if you're still flying at 39,000 feet, if you're still heading to the right waypoint, how long you've got left or what the weather is going to be like at your destination airport; you can now relax and do it in the garden or anywhere within WiFi reach really and control your flight with your thumb.\n\nBut if this isn't enough, AirTrack can also use your device's built-in GPS, Accelerometer and Gyro to determine your current movements and attitude and the Internet to download real weather to simulate an aircraft's sensors.\n\nTurn your car trip into a flight experience by getting information about your instant position, heading and surrounding waypoints. See yourself in an EFIS style navigation display / primary flight display or plan your multi-leg trip with the built in route planner FMC which gives you real-time information about your waypoints, how far they are and how long it will take you to reach them.\n\nWith its built-in database of FIX, VOR, NDB and Airports, AirTrack can also be used as a flight simulator companion allowing you to plan and monitor your trip, target a VOR or even perform a full IFR approach without ever needing to look at the screen.\n\nThe AirTrack features include:\n\n- A full Primary Flight Display with speed, altitude, vertical speed, barometric pressure\n- Also in the PFD, compass, AI with roll/pitch,  auto-pilot status and settings. \n- Instant GS, IAS, MACH, TAS and VS when available.\n- An MFD with APP, VOR, MAP and PLN mode with centered and expanded views.\n- The whole world as a map of geo contours in the MFD.\n- NAV / ADF and ILS / Approach guidance in the PFD and MFD.\n- An MCP panel to control the Aircraft's Auto-Pilot.\n- Wind speed and direction indicators.\n- Next waypoint reporting on the MFD.\n- Electronic Flight Bag style interface for iPad,\n- An advanced multimode navigation display.\n- A multi-leg FMC style route planner.\n- Enroute Airways decoder.\n- SID, STAR and Approach procedures decoder. \n- Bi-directional radio stack.\n- AutoTransponder Mode.\n- Customizable waypoints.\n- Saved waypoints and Nearby waypoints.\n- Real-Time weather information for airports.\n- Detailed airport information including runways.\n- A database of localities worldwide.\n- Built-in database of intersections, VORs and NDBs.\n- Support for NAVIGRAPH FMS AIRAC cycles.\n- Tracking of VATSIM / IVAO/ PilotEdge  surrounding air traffic on the MFD.\n- Tracking of which controllers are online in VATSIM/IVAO.\n- Auto-tuning of ATC frequencies to COM1/COM2.\n- Automatic position report generation for oceanic.\n- Enhanced graphics with high-res Retina Display.\n- Remote Yoke/Joystick/Rudder for flight simulator.\n- Support for X-Plane\n- Support for Flight Simulator 2020\n- Support for FS9 and FSX(*)\n- Cloud Services flight plan and waypoint sync. \n- Cloud based auto-sync advanced flight planner\n- Cloud based Approach plate / charts viewer with user charts.\n- And much more ...\n\n(*) Support for the old FS9 and FSX simulators is limited and provided by a third party plugin which is no longer actively maintained."

However, we will release database updates right after the new information will become available. \n\n- You can create and save the driving routes to follow them later. Application will display your current position on the route and display the route on the map.  Every route is saved in the application database, so you don't need to re-create it every time application starts up.\n\n - Tapping the \"HUD\" icon mirrors all the text, so if you position the iPhone horizontally under your car's windscreen you can see perfectly readable half-transparent reflection of the picture displayed.  Note: this mode works pretty well at night time and twilight, but on direct sunlight the screen brightness can be insufficient. \n\n- aSmartHUD can keep track on 4 speed limits, giving a warning each time you crossing it. Normally, it's legal speed limits within cities, local roads and high-speed motorways. \"Never exceed speed\" is the speed you should not exceed under any conditions. Like technical limit of your vehicle or the point where government can arrest your driving license. \n\n- 3D Trip Log Graph - unique way to represent the speed, location and altitude data in a single 3D graph. Color coded speed and altitude chart is constantly adjusted according to your moving trajectory.  In Track Preferences, you can set the transparency of all the components of the chart or switch them off completely.\n\n- Apple and OpenStreet maps in several flavors and color modes.\n- Landscape and portrait screen modes.\n- \"Records\" screen, with maximum reached speed, altitude and distance from start.\n- Different measurement units, display color schemes (6 available), log type, sounds and more.  \n- Select the music iPod Playlist, pause, play, skip or rewind it's items, set the player in Shuffle or Repeat mode. \n- Advanced location Info (longitude and latitude, GPS measurement precision) and more. \n- Local weather forecast;\n\nIMPORTANT: this features list in not complete. Please visit the product page for more info!\n\nThanks to everyone for your suggestions about additional functionality! THE BEST AND FASTEST WAY TO CONTACT US IS SENDING YOUR REQUESTS AND BUG REPORTS to support@atoll-ordenadores.com.

      "label": "Do you need GPS NMEA location data for your computer or other device - maybe to use some mapping or navigation software?\nUntil now, you couldn't get external access to the GPS inside your iPhone or iPad, but now with GPS2IP you can stream the information in realtime to solve your requirements.\n\nBEWARE - GPS2IP is *not* able to be used for the Apple turn-by-turn navigation app, or Google Maps, or most car navigation programs.\nIt is designed for enthusiasts, or more sophisticated navigation software that can use an external wireless GPS unit. If you aren't sure what NMEA is, please check the website before buying.\nThis is a rather special piece of software, and must be used in the right system. PLEASE CHECK THE WEBSITE: www.capsicumdreams.com/iPhone/gps2ip/\n\nWe have a free version \"GPS2IP Lite\" that has most of the same features, so that you can try it out for free.\nHave a look on our website: http://capsicumdreams.com/gps2ip/differences.php\nTry it for free, and only buy this full-featured version if it does what you need!\n\nThe iPhone becomes a GPS server, and to get the information, you just connect to your iPhone using either wifi or Bluetooth LE.\nAlternatively, you can also push the NMEA data to any online server, using either TCP or UDP and process the information however you want.\n\nEach device running GPS2IP can send a unique identifier, so that if you have multiple devices you can determine which device is sending what messages.\n\nGPS2IP now can be configured to restart automatically after your iOS device restarts, so you'll always keep track of your position.\n\nApart from navigation software, other methods for connection include telnet or netcat, or many terminal programs.\n\nSome navigation software such as MacEnc can read from an IP address natively.\nSetting up a connection between MacEnc and GPS2IP is easy.\nJust have a look at the capsicumDreams website!\nhttp://capsicumdreams.com/gps2ip/\n\nDifferent NMEA messages can be selected for transmission according to your requirements.\nOne non-standard message that GPS2IP transmits that is very useful for sailing is $PASHR.\n\nGPS 2 IP can run when the iPhone sleeps to support constant location reporting, but be aware that continued use of the GPS when running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nIf your device dies or you turn it off when it was running, GPS2IP now automatically resumes sending the location. Beware that this will decrease battery life - we recommend keeping it charging if possible.\n\nGPS2IP can also be configured to output data at a selectable frequency (for example once every minute).\n\nYou can lock the settings, so that no unauthorised people can change the settings.\n\nLots more information and instructions on usage can be found on our website. Enjoy!"

      "label": "Keyhole markup language (KML) is a standard format used by many other mapping and navigation tools to represent geographical information. KML Map lets you create, display, and store KML map data and attached media content (often called metadata) on the iPhone/iPod Touch. Use KML Map to view photographs on maps from the location and direction they were taken, to create your own custom maps containing point, line, and polygonal data, to display topographic maps and ground overlays on top of map layers, to visualize scientific data and metadata for a variety of applications, and much more.\n\nHere are some of the features of KML Map:\n\n•Display KML point, line, and polygonal features, ground and photo overlays.\n•Standard north up or rotating map that points in your look direction.\n•Display KML content from Safari or embedded in email. Just click and see the data in KML Map.\n•Add new map features. \n•Assign address information to new objects using reverse geocoding. \n•Elevation data is downloaded from global terrain data server (not GPS) for consistency.\n•Display ground overlays (e.g., your own maps and images) over base maps/images \n•Photo overlays are rendered on a map from the location and direction they were taken.\n•Supports multiple, variable-transparency map layers\n•Read compressed KMZ files\n•Transfer files between KML Map and your computer using iTunes File Sharing\n•Download KML and KMZ content from network URLs\n•Supports standard and custom pushpins/placemark icons\n•Shows/hides names on map\n•Quickly find an object of interest in the current map layer by name\n•Display full HTML content contained in CDATA tag (text, pictures, sound files, or movies)\n\nImportant Notice\n\nKML Map understands a subset of the KML language, specifically points, line strings, and polygons (without holes). It can display ground overlays (LatLonBox format only) and photo overlays. HTML contained within CDATA tags (including pictures, sound files, and video) are rendered in a web view window. Files containing unsupported tags will not load. File sizes should be limited to 5-7 Mbytes. If the file is too large KML Map will quit. The size of files that can be emailed is limited by the operating system. KML Map also reads compressed KML or KMZ files. However, depending on the internal structure and contents of the file, KML Map may only be able to display one KMZ file at a time.\n\nN.B. Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

      "label": "Pro Altimeter uses the high-fidelity barometric pressure sensor in iOS devices to measure and compute altitude.\n\nPro Altimeter has a dead simple interface.  Barometric altitude and GPS altitude are displayed in large easy to read numbers, showing units of both feet and meters, and giving realtime accuracy estimates from the hardware.  At bottom are calibration and display mode buttons. The display offers a highly-readable daytime mode with black digits on an LCD-green background, and a reversed night mode that is easy on the eyes in dark conditions. That's it!\n\nProper calibration is necessary to measure altitude from barometric pressure (this is why a pilot \"dials in\" the cockpit altimeter before taking off). Pro Altimeter offers four different methods for calibration -- choose the easiest and most convenient:\n\n1. Use GPS altitude.  This method correlates the measured local barometric pressure with the altitude measured by GPS. This method can be used when your device has a clear line of sight to the sky and a reliable GPS fix with good accuracy.\n\n2. Manually enter altitude.  This method correlates the measured local barometric pressure with known altitude from landmarks, elevation benchmarks, trail markers, topo maps, land surveys, etc.  Altitude can be entered in feet or meters.\n\n3. Manually enter pressure.  If you have a weather station, weather report, or METAR report with equivalent sea level pressure for a nearby location, this can be used to correlate local barometric pressure to altitude.  Pressure can be entered with units of inches Hg, kPa, or mb. \n\n4. Check local airports.  With the tap of a button, Pro Altimeter will locate the five closest airports within 100 miles (160km) of your present location anywhere in the world, and pull in METAR data.  From that list of five, pick the airport of your choice and Pro Altimeter will import pressure data for calibration.\n\nOnce calibrated, Pro Altimeter keeps track of the time since its last calibration.  Because weather and local barometric pressure change over time, the app will warn you when 6 hours have elapsed since the last calibration by flashing the \"CALIBRATE\" button.  You should calibrate as frequently as practical -- for example, on a hike, calibrate whenever you pass a trail marker or elevation benchmark.  But at a minimum, calibrate at least every 6 hours or whenever weather changes in your area.\n\nPro Altimeter is intended for iOS devices with a built-in barometric pressure sensor (iPhone 6 and later, iPad Air 2 and later, iPad mini 4 and later, and iPad Pro).  On older devices without a barometric pressure sensor, only GPS altitude and accuracy will be displayed.  \n\nIf you have an Apple Watch, check out the new Pro Altimeter for Watch and get all this same functionality on your wrist!"

      "label": "A simple tool for businesses to talk to their customers. — WhatsApp Business from Meta\n\nWhatsApp Business enables you to have a business presence on WhatsApp, communicate more efficiently with your customers, and help you grow your business.\n\nIf you have separate business and personal phone numbers, you can have both WhatsApp Business and WhatsApp Messenger installed on the same phone, and register them with different numbers.\n\nIn addition to the features available in WhatsApp Messenger, WhatsApp Business includes:\n\n• BUSINESS PROFILE: Create a profile for your business to help your customers find valuable information — like your website, location, or contact information.\n\n• BUSINESS MESSAGING TOOLS: Be more responsive to your customers by using Away messages to indicate that you're away.\n\n• LANDLINE/FIXED NUMBER SUPPORT: You can use WhatsApp Business with a landline (or fixed) phone number and your customers can message you on that number. During verification, select the “Call me” option to receive the code over a phone call.\n\n• RUN BOTH WHATSAPP MESSENGER AND WHATSAPP BUSINESS: You can use both WhatsApp Business and WhatsApp Messenger on the same phone, but each app must have its own unique phone number.\n\n• WHATSAPP WEB: You can more efficiently respond to your customers right from your computer's browser.\n\nWhatsApp Business is built on top of WhatsApp Messenger and includes all the features that you rely on, such as the ability to send multimedia, free calls*, free international messaging*, group chat, offline messages, and much more.\n\n*Data charges may apply. Contact your provider for details.*\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe're always excited to hear from you!

Ref Tools gives you access to the tools, guidance, support, and information you need—on the job and in the field.    \r\n  \r\nDownload Ref Tools to access the latest version of Magnetic Tool.   \n\nEnsuring that a solenoid valve coil is working properly, or detecting a faulty one, is an important step in many repair or installation projects. Magnetic Tool makes testing a solenoid valve coil quick and easy. Just open the app, hold your smartphone up to the solenoid coil you want to test, and watch for the wheel in the app to start spinning. If it rotates, your solenoid valve is good to go.\n\nIf a solenoid valve is in a tough-to-reach space, you can also set Magnetic Tool to provide audio or haptic (or both) feedback when it detects a magnetic field. That way, you can check on a valve without seeing your screen, so you can maneuver your phone any way you need to.\n\nMagnetic Tool has two modes: Simple and Advanced. With Simple mode, all you need to do is open the app and start testing—it's that simple. Advanced mode allows you to adjust the threshold tolerances of the magnetometer, which is most often used to reduce or eliminate interference from other nearby solenoid valves. \n\nMagnetic Tool is part of the Danfoss CoolApps Toolbox, a collection of mobile apps designed to help installers and service technicians with their daily tasks. See the full collection at CoolApps.Danfoss.com. \n\nSupport \nFor app support, please use the in-app feedback function found in the app settings or send an email to coolapp@danfoss.com \n\nEngineering Tomorrow \nDanfoss engineers advanced technologies that enable us to build a better, smarter and more efficient tomorrow.

Producers can also locate the points of sale for their olive oils.\n \nAbout olive oils\nThis section provides ongoing information about high quality olive oil and its production. Users can read about types of olive oils, learn about tasting techniques, and the health benefits of high quality olive oils, in addition to many more interesting facts.\n \nRating\nThe rating feature was granted only to eligible users, who can send their feedback on the olive oil they purchased. Any user can become eligible only after answering correctly a questionnaire, which proves his/her knowledge and experience and ultimately allowing them to properly rate olive oil and distinguish the high quality ones from the others following the consumers' knowledgeable feedback.\n \nNews\nStay informed about the latest news surrounding the world of olive oil in addition to related news and activities of the Lebanese Ministry of Agriculture (MoA)."

The dynamic between the “normal” web-based version of Shopify, and the mobile app, is amazing, with little to no changes (Except the size being scaled down of course.)“\n(Source: https://ecommercenewshq.com/the-complete-shopify-mobile-app-review/)\n\nReview from David B via g2.com\n“Shopify [..] allows me to do important things for my store from anywhere. That is because it gives me advantages in managing the store from a mobile device.”\n(Source: https://www.g2.com/products/shopify/reviews/shopify-review-2822877)\n\nABOUT SHOPIFY\nShopify’s ecommerce app can keep your business moving quickly. In the fast-paced world of ecommerce, that speed can be the difference between a sale for you or for your competitor.  \n\nShopify has everything you need to start selling online, for any ecommerce business. Start your business today on the one platform with the ecommerce and point of sale features to start, run, and grow your business."

Use that code along with your username and password.\n•        Receive a push notification on your mobile device that you approve as authentication. If your organization requires you to define an additional device authentication mechanism to meet the security requirements, you will be prompted for the additional local authentication such as passphrases or biometrics.\n•        Use Touch ID, Face ID, or Passcode in a push notification to authenticate yourself on your mobile device.\nNote: Touch ID or Face ID authentication requires that your mobile device is Touch ID or Face ID capable and that you have registered a fingerprint or facial recognition authentication on the device.\n\nThe strong authentication method you use depends on the method implemented by your participating organization.\n\nYou can generate a security code even if you do not have a network or mobile connection.\n\nQR/App Codes\n\nScan a QR Code at participating organizations such as Google, Facebook, Amazon, and more to generate a security code every 30 seconds to securely sign in. Enter this security code along with your password to add strong authentication to your favorite websites.\n\nBe sure to read the VIP End User Agreement after downloading VIP Access: https://docs.broadcom.com/doc/end-user-agreement-english"

      "label": "A simple tool for businesses to talk to their customers. — WhatsApp Business from Meta\n\nWhatsApp Business enables you to have a business presence on WhatsApp, communicate more efficiently with your customers, and help you grow your business.\n\nIf you have separate business and personal phone numbers, you can have both WhatsApp Business and WhatsApp Messenger installed on the same phone, and register them with different numbers.\n\nIn addition to the features available in WhatsApp Messenger, WhatsApp Business includes:\n\n• BUSINESS PROFILE: Create a profile for your business to help your customers find valuable information — like your website, location, or contact information.\n\n• BUSINESS MESSAGING TOOLS: Be more responsive to your customers by using Away messages to indicate that you're away.\n\n• LANDLINE/FIXED NUMBER SUPPORT: You can use WhatsApp Business with a landline (or fixed) phone number and your customers can message you on that number. During verification, select the “Call me” option to receive the code over a phone call.\n\n• RUN BOTH WHATSAPP MESSENGER AND WHATSAPP BUSINESS: You can use both WhatsApp Business and WhatsApp Messenger on the same phone, but each app must have its own unique phone number.\n\n• WHATSAPP WEB: You can more efficiently respond to your customers right from your computer's browser.\n\nWhatsApp Business is built on top of WhatsApp Messenger and includes all the features that you rely on, such as the ability to send multimedia, free calls*, free international messaging*, group chat, offline messages, and much more.\n\n*Data charges may apply. Contact your provider for details.*\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe're always excited to hear from you!

The dynamic between the “normal” web-based version of Shopify, and the mobile app, is amazing, with little to no changes (Except the size being scaled down of course.)“\n(Source: https://ecommercenewshq.com/the-complete-shopify-mobile-app-review/)\n\nReview from David B via g2.com\n“Shopify [..] allows me to do important things for my store from anywhere. That is because it gives me advantages in managing the store from a mobile device.”\n(Source: https://www.g2.com/products/shopify/reviews/shopify-review-2822877)\n\nABOUT SHOPIFY\nShopify’s ecommerce app can keep your business moving quickly. In the fast-paced world of ecommerce, that speed can be the difference between a sale for you or for your competitor.  \n\nShopify has everything you need to start selling online, for any ecommerce business. Start your business today on the one platform with the ecommerce and point of sale features to start, run, and grow your business."

Ref Tools gives you access to the tools, guidance, support, and information you need—on the job and in the field.    \r\n  \r\nDownload Ref Tools to access the latest version of Magnetic Tool.   \n\nEnsuring that a solenoid valve coil is working properly, or detecting a faulty one, is an important step in many repair or installation projects. Magnetic Tool makes testing a solenoid valve coil quick and easy. Just open the app, hold your smartphone up to the solenoid coil you want to test, and watch for the wheel in the app to start spinning. If it rotates, your solenoid valve is good to go.\n\nIf a solenoid valve is in a tough-to-reach space, you can also set Magnetic Tool to provide audio or haptic (or both) feedback when it detects a magnetic field. That way, you can check on a valve without seeing your screen, so you can maneuver your phone any way you need to.\n\nMagnetic Tool has two modes: Simple and Advanced. With Simple mode, all you need to do is open the app and start testing—it's that simple. Advanced mode allows you to adjust the threshold tolerances of the magnetometer, which is most often used to reduce or eliminate interference from other nearby solenoid valves. \n\nMagnetic Tool is part of the Danfoss CoolApps Toolbox, a collection of mobile apps designed to help installers and service technicians with their daily tasks. See the full collection at CoolApps.Danfoss.com. \n\nSupport \nFor app support, please use the in-app feedback function found in the app settings or send an email to coolapp@danfoss.com \n\nEngineering Tomorrow \nDanfoss engineers advanced technologies that enable us to build a better, smarter and more efficient tomorrow. In the world’s growing cities, we ensure the supply of fresh food and optimal comfort in our homes and offices, while meeting the need for energy-efficient infrastructure, connected systems and integrated renewable energy. Our solutions are used in such areas as refrigeration, air conditioning, heating, motor control and mobile machinery.

It has made my job of scanning and saving to Google Drive infinitely easier, and for that I much appreciate it.\"\n-- Rachel Maddow Fan\n\n---\nKEY FEATURES\n* Scan documents with a single page, or a batch of pages like an entire book with single/multi-page scan mode with tutorials all the way;\n* Scan photos as documents from Photo Album;\n* Automatically recognize documents by intelligent border detection;\n* Customize page size when exporting documents;\n* Professional filters, including Color, Black & White, Photo, Grayscale;\n* Recognize every word of the documents with AI OCR technology and translate them into lots of languages as you want;\n* Share documents as PDF, JPG by faxing or emailing them, or upload them to Dropbox, Google Drive, Box, OneDrive, Evernote, iCloud Drive;\n* Auto upload scanned documents onto cloud drives;\n\n---\nWHY SCANNER SE?\n* Customizable\nBetter than most similar apps, re-editing saved documents is empowered so that you can move pages, replace pages with new ones, or even merge two documents into one.\n* Organized\nAll scanned documents or files can be organized in any way as you like.

Once sent, these messages also encourage the customer to click on a \"Video Call\" button. When the customer initiates the call, the business's staff is connected with them via a live-streaming, one-way or two-way video conversation. Businesses can use Beam to follow up with leads, engage and build rapport with customers, send personalized video emails and texts, and to perform live-stream product demos."

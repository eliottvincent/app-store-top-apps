We will continue in the hopes that there will soon be peace for our children and children all around the world!\n\nDrawing Academy from Bini Games is a unique app where kids are inspired to learn by drawing. In our app, drawing gets children excited even for letters and numbers!\n\nIn preschoolers, drawing plays an important role in the development of the right side of the brain. As they draw, children process information in multiple ways, such as with their eyes and body, as well as emotionally. We created the Drawing Academy app with all this in mind.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n- 150 step-by step drawing tutorials in 10 thematic sets with different complexity levels for kids aged 2 to 6\n- “ABC\" and \"Numbers” packs to get children interested in learning letters and numbers through drawing with pictures they make themselves\n- a huge variety of tools, including pencils, crayons, stickers, patterns, and paints\n- tracing and free-drawing mechanics to help prepare your child’s hand for writing with step-by-step motor-skill refinement, from the moment they first scribble to their finalized masterpieces\n- activities that form a customized age-based learning program, taking your child’s interests into account\n- unique easy-to-follow tracing exercises that guide your child’s creativity without limitations and stimulating free drawing\n\nDrawing Academy isn’t just another coloring book!\n\nNote: only part of the content in the screenshots is available in the free version of the application. To gain access to the full version, you will need to make an in-app purchase.\n\nSubscription Details\n\nGet access to over 100 cute characters and drawings after subscribing to the Drawing Academy. Just download and go!\n\nA free 7-day trial period is available to you, or you can subscribe right after download.\n\nAfter your free trial, your subscription will automatically start unless you adjust your subscription settings at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.\n\nWe provide different subscription options for your convenience: monthly and annual subscription.\n\nIf you change your mind at any point, cancellation is easy through your iTunes settings.\n\nPayment for subscriptions will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\n\nYour subscription automatically renews unless you turn the renewal feature off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.\n\nYou will be charged for renewal within 24 hours of the end of the current period.\n\nYou can cancel your subscription anytime through your Account Settings without any cancellation fees.\n\nYou can use your subscription on any device registered with your Apple ID.\n\nIf you need help, have questions, or just want to say, “hi!”, get in touch at feedback@bini.games.\n\nhttps://binibambini.com/terms-of-use/\n\nhttp://binibambini.com/privacy\n\nMore about Bini Games:\n\nBini Games is a group of enthusiastic professionals including designers, artists, animators, programmers, and musicians, who love to create digital games for children.\n\nAll our games are safe and do not collect any personal information."

There’s a new surprise around every corner, but Let Me Speak will help you talk your way out of any situation.\n\nEverything is in modern, everyday English with a full audio voiceover by native speakers from the United States. So you’ll learn real-world English and practice American pronunciation from the get-go.

Each new word comes with a translation and a memorable illustration.\nYou’ll learn new words every day. And with the spaced repetition, smart reminders, and clever associations, you won’t forget them. \n\n\nYou also get to practice your new vocabulary right away in conversations that recreate real-life situations. Here are some of the scenarios you’ll learn from:\n\n-   \tPassport control\n-   \tChecking in at the hotel\n-     Hailing a cab\n-   \tOrdering food in a restaurant\n-   \tVisiting a museum\n-   \tShopping at a supermarket\n-   \tPartying at a bar\n-   \tMeeting new people\n-   \tJob interview\n-   \tand more than 50 other topics\n\nPERFECT YOUR GRAMMAR\n\nSpeak correctly right from the start.\nYou’ll easily master the grammar topics thanks to interactive exercises and easy-to-understand grammar explanations.

Graded entirely on your pronunciation, our app makes language learning fresh and fun.\n\nLearn to speak Spanish, French, German and English like a native speaker.

As you sing or speak, you can see the translation of the lyrics back into your native language.\n\nWe’ll grade you on your pronunciation, not your pitch or tone, so you can see how well you’ve done and how you improve over time!\n\nLong gone are the days of memorizing long vocabulary lists, repeating the same keywords and phrases, or reading pages of grammar rules. Now you can learn through song – scientifically proven to be one of the most effective ways to learn how to speak a new language!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\nHow does the Univoice app work?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n**No singing skill required! We grade only on pronunciation**\n• Pick from Spanish, French, German, and English\n• Choose from a wide range of 30+ music genres\n• Sing (or speak) with the artist in the language you’re learning\n• Follow the translation into your native language as you speak\n• Familiarize yourself with idioms & slang words you won’t find in a textbook\n• Expand your vocabulary & learn new phrases the fun way... through music!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\nWhat motivates Univoicers to learn a new language?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n• Becoming a global citizen & raising globally-minded children\n• Connecting with others in a more meaningful, organic way\n• Staying tightly connected to heritage & strengthening family ties\n• Communicating more fluidly with coworkers, clients, patients\n• Learning to speak (and sing) a dream language like a native\n• Immersing oneself in the culture, while learning the language\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\nWhat subscription plans does Univoice offer?\n----------------------------------------------------------\nAll app users will receive 5 minutes / day, free of charge.\n\nOur auto-renewable premium plans feature unlimited song access, across the following term lengths:\n\n• Weekly: $2.99\n• Monthly: $8.99\n• 3 Months: $17.99 \n• 6 Months: $35.99\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nEntertain & educate yourself with Univoice.

Los niños pequeños responden bien a este método con animales, y enseñarles el alfabeto de esta manera sigue siendo práctico. Se utilizan hermosas ilustraciones y sonidos divertidos para crear interés en sus hijos.\r\n\r\nEsta aplicación contiene 3 módulos:\r\n\r\n(i) ABC: aprender el alfabeto \r\n\r\nEn este módulo, sus hijos entrarán en contacto con el abecedario y escucharán cómo deletrear. Mentalmente, ellos aprenderán el alfabeto al asociarlo con un animal cuyo nombre comience con determinada letra del alfabeto.\r\n\r\n(ii) Elige el animal \r\n\r\nEn este módulo, sus hijos aprenderán a relacionar cada letra con un animal. Se escucha un sonido de aplausos para animarlos cada vez que ellos hagan la combinación correcta.\r\n\r\n(iii) Deletrea el nombre \r\n\r\nEn este módulo, sus seres queridos aprenderán a escribir los nombres de los animales que están presentes en la aplicación. Primero, las letras saldrán en el orden correcto desde la cabeza del animal, luego, se barajarán las letras y sus hijos intentarán escribir el nombre del animal colocando las letras en el orden correcto en los cuadros de fondo. Este módulo está hecho para que sus hijos reciben la ayuda necesaria para memorizar cómo escribir correctamente los nombres de muchos animales."

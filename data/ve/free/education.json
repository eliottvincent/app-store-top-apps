Graded entirely on your pronunciation, our app makes language learning fresh and fun.\n\nLearn to speak Spanish, French, German and English like a native speaker. Unlike traditional language learning apps, that teach you ‘classroom’ speak, Univoice teaches you to speak a new language as it’s spoken in the real world, including idioms and slang words.\n\nJust load up the app, select the language and genre of music that suits your mood and start singing along with the artist. As you sing or speak, you can see the translation of the lyrics back into your native language.\n\nWe’ll grade you on your pronunciation, not your pitch or tone, so you can see how well you’ve done and how you improve over time!\n\nLong gone are the days of memorizing long vocabulary lists, repeating the same keywords and phrases, or reading pages of grammar rules. Now you can learn through song – scientifically proven to be one of the most effective ways to learn how to speak a new language!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\nHow does the Univoice app work?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n**No singing skill required! We grade only on pronunciation**\n• Pick from Spanish, French, German, and English\n• Choose from a wide range of 30+ music genres\n• Sing (or speak) with the artist in the language you’re learning\n• Follow the translation into your native language as you speak\n• Familiarize yourself with idioms & slang words you won’t find in a textbook\n• Expand your vocabulary & learn new phrases the fun way... through music!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\nWhat motivates Univoicers to learn a new language?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n• Becoming a global citizen & raising globally-minded children\n• Connecting with others in a more meaningful, organic way\n• Staying tightly connected to heritage & strengthening family ties\n• Communicating more fluidly with coworkers, clients, patients\n• Learning to speak (and sing) a dream language like a native\n• Immersing oneself in the culture, while learning the language\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\nWhat subscription plans does Univoice offer?\n----------------------------------------------------------\nAll app users will receive 5 minutes / day, free of charge.\n\nOur auto-renewable premium plans feature unlimited song access, across the following term lengths:\n\n• Weekly: $2.99\n• Monthly: $8.99\n• 3 Months: $17.99 \n• 6 Months: $35.99\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nEntertain & educate yourself with Univoice.

      "label": "We are pleased to present you Idàfá, the dream Ifá app of Ifábíyìí Akódà. Listening to our followers, this new app was born with the aim of facilitating the learning of the signs of Ifá, especially for people who still do not know how to interpret the verses of Ifá, so that the message of Eledumare reaches all possible people, without they need to be initiated or have already begun their process of learning the traditional practice.\r\n\r\nIdàfá contains a summary and interpretation made by Ifábíyìí Akódà of unpublished traditional verses of the 256 signs of Ifá, which in the West is known as \"Dice Ifá\". It is designed for the uninitiated, those who are beginning their learning or people who want to know in a quick and brief way what the Odù Ifá says, thus complementing the Ojú Odù applications and the Apola series. Idàfá is the first app of its kind in traditional practice, with information provided by authentic Yoruba babalawo.\r\n\r\nOur intention is that you focus more on learning and that you do it in the most dynamic and intuitive way possible. That is why we have created this unique application in its style, very functional and lighter so that all your available time can be dedicated to the study of Ifá in an entertaining way. Just by shaking the phone or touching the screen you can get a sign and, in a few seconds, access the information on it. You can also search for the specific Odù that interests you quickly in the sign library.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that this new Ifá app developed by Ifábíyìí Akódà has the function of teaching truthful information about each of the Ifá signs in a didactic way, and under no circumstances should it be used or interpreted as a real Ifá divination. Idàfá is not an Ifá divination nor does it replace it.\r\n\r\nThe highlights of Idàfá:\r\n\r\n• Totally free content.\r\n• Shake the phone or touch the screen and take out one of the signs, in just a few seconds you will access the information.\r\n• Access the library with the 256 signs of Ifá.\r\n• Version in English and Spanish\r\n• VIP zone.\r\n• Learn about other Ifá apps.\r\n\r\nWe are an important community and we are always listening to suggestions. We appreciate all the reviews that you send us through the application, because they allow us to make improvements to give you the best traditional Ifá applications."

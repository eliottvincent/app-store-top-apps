Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and grade the assignment - at school or on the go. Students and teachers receive notifications when they have new content in Classroom, so they are always up to date.\n\nThere are many benefits of using Classroom:\n\nEasy to set up\nTeachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It takes just minutes to set up.\n\nSaves time\nThe simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review, and grade assignments quickly, all in one place.\n\nImproves organization\nStudents can see all of their assignments on an assignments page, and all class materials (e.g., documents, photos, and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.\n\nEnhances communication\nClassroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.\n\nSecure\nLike the rest of Google Workspace for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes.\n\nPermissions Notice:\nCamera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.\nMicrophone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.\nPhotos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom. Photos or videos posted to Classroom will be stored on Google servers in order to show them in Classroom."

With DMV WRITTEN TEST you get state-specific DMV practice tests that are the same as the real test.\n\nHOW IT WORKS\n• No Need for the Driver's Manual:  We provide you with the most up-to-date questions based on the current version of your state's official driver's handbook.  Don't be surprised with outdated test questions. We cover every DMV, DDS, BMV, MVA, RMV, DOR, MVC, MVD, DOT, DOL in the country.\n• Take Comprehensive Practice Tests:  Our tests cover every section of the driver's manual so no matter what state you're in, you'll be well prepared.  Go through our practice tests and when you take the real thing, it will seem easy.\n• Pass the DMV Test:  Once you've practiced enough and are passing the practice exams, you should be ready to make an appointment with the DMV.  With a 99% chance of passing, you'll be ready to pass the test the first time!\n\nPRACTICE DMV TESTS MAKE YOU PASS FASTER\nA whopping 5 out of 10 people fail the DMV test the first time they take it, but the people that use DMV Written Test see a 99% pass rate.  We also let you take every sample DMV permit test and DMV license test as many times as needed so you can be sure you're ready for the real thing.\n\nWHY CHOOSE DMV WRITTEN TEST?\n• State-Specific Tests:  Because each state has different driving laws and restrictions, we've tailored our tests to each specific state.  This isn't one of those generic DMV practice tests.  \n• Accurate & Up-to-Date:  We constantly monitor the newest versions of your state's official driving handbook and traffic laws and then update our test questions accordingly.  They are always accurate and up to date.\n• The Same Content:  Since we take our facts directly from the handbooks, it allows us to create practice test questions that are very similar, if not identical, to the questions found on the actual driver's license test.\n\nWHY WE’RE SO EFFECTIVE\n• Know what to expect:  Our tests have the same number of questions and the same passing score requirements as the actual tests so you'll know what to expect.\n• Feel confident as you walk into the DMV:  You've seen it all before and know what's coming.  You got this!\n• Stay motivated to study:  With our practice tests you'll learn as you go and see your own progress in real time.\n\nHAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS?\nIf you have any questions, want to report a bug, or notice any errors, feel free to reach out to us."

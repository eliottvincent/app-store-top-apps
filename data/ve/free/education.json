You’ll be speaking English in no time without having to memorize lists of words and out-of-context grammar rules. \n\n\n\nIMMERSE IN REAL ENGLISH\n\nYou’ll make your way through an interactive and engaging story that takes place in New York. Lively, colorful, and sometimes surprising characters: an eccentric old lady will help you find a place to live, and a greedy hot-dog vendor who will try to short-change… They (and many more) speak different accents and will help you master street talk. There’s a new surprise around every corner, but Let Me Speak will help you talk your way out of any situation.\n\nEverything is in modern, everyday English with a full audio voiceover by native speakers from the United States. So you’ll learn real-world English and practice American pronunciation from the get-go. Each conversation takes no more than 3 minutes and will fit into even the busiest of schedules.\n\n\n\n\nIMPROVE YOUR VOCABULARY\n\nYou’ll learn 6,000 of the most common words everyone needs to travel, work, and communicate in a foreign language. Each new word comes with a translation and a memorable illustration.\nYou’ll learn new words every day. And with the spaced repetition, smart reminders, and clever associations, you won’t forget them. \n\n\nYou also get to practice your new vocabulary right away in conversations that recreate real-life situations.

Graded entirely on your pronunciation, our app makes language learning fresh and fun.\n\nLearn to speak Spanish, French, German and English like a native speaker.

Now you can learn through song – scientifically proven to be one of the most effective ways to learn how to speak a new language!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\nHow does the Univoice app work?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n**No singing skill required! We grade only on pronunciation**\n• Pick from Spanish, French, German, and English\n• Choose from a wide range of 30+ music genres\n• Sing (or speak) with the artist in the language you’re learning\n• Follow the translation into your native language as you speak\n• Familiarize yourself with idioms & slang words you won’t find in a textbook\n• Expand your vocabulary & learn new phrases the fun way... through music!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\nWhat motivates Univoicers to learn a new language?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n• Becoming a global citizen & raising globally-minded children\n• Connecting with others in a more meaningful, organic way\n• Staying tightly connected to heritage & strengthening family ties\n• Communicating more fluidly with coworkers, clients, patients\n• Learning to speak (and sing) a dream language like a native\n• Immersing oneself in the culture, while learning the language\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\nWhat subscription plans does Univoice offer?\n----------------------------------------------------------\nAll app users will receive 5 minutes / day, free of charge.\n\nOur auto-renewable premium plans feature unlimited song access, across the following term lengths:\n\n• Weekly: $2.99\n• Monthly: $8.99\n• 3 Months: $17.99 \n• 6 Months: $35.99\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nEntertain & educate yourself with Univoice.

The discovered reactions will be displayed in a usual and ionic form. Organic chemistry formulas are drawn as images by the app.\n\nConvenient interactive Periodic Table. Tap a chemical element in the table to find more information about it. Use a search button to find an element by name or symbol.\n\nThe calculator of molar masses. Enter a chemical compound correctly and it will show molar masses and percentages of elements.\n\nThe table of solubility of substances is added in the app as well as Acid strength chart. Now your textbooks become waste!\n\nThe best solver of chemical equations for iPhone and iPad.\n\nAdd new shiny Widgets to the desktop and learn information about chemical elements from Periodic Table subconsciously. It's a fun way to learn and remember chemical elements data.\n\nAll these tables and charts are available in the free Chemistry app:\n* Periodic table\n* Atoms in Augmented Reality\n* Chemical reactions search\n* Offline access to information about chemical elements\n* Solubility table\n* Molar mass calculator\n* Electronegativity of elements\n* Molecular weights of organic substances\n* Reactivity series\n* Acid strengths chart\n* Acids, anions, salts list\n* Standard electrode potential\n* Widgets to easily remember the periodic table and chemical elements\n\nThe chemistry falls into to number of the most important sciences and is one of the main school objects. Its studying begins with the Periodic Table. Interactive approach to a training material is more effective than classical. As in it technologies which became the family for the modern pupils are used.\n\nThe periodic table of elements is one of the most important tools in chemistry. The periodic table is essential for understanding the structure and behavior of atoms and molecules. It also provides a useful framework for predicting the properties of new and unknown elements.\n\nRead more about our terms and conditions here:\nTerms of Use: http://getchemistry.io/terms-and-conditions/ios/\nPrivacy policy: http://getchemistry.io/privacy-policy/ios/"

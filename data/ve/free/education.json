We will continue in the hopes that there will soon be peace for our children and children all around the world!\n\nDrawing Academy from Bini Games is a unique app where kids are inspired to learn by drawing. In our app, drawing gets children excited even for letters and numbers!\n\nIn preschoolers, drawing plays an important role in the development of the right side of the brain. As they draw, children process information in multiple ways, such as with their eyes and body, as well as emotionally. We created the Drawing Academy app with all this in mind.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n- 150 step-by step drawing tutorials in 10 thematic sets with different complexity levels for kids aged 2 to 6\n- “ABC\" and \"Numbers” packs to get children interested in learning letters and numbers through drawing with pictures they make themselves\n- a huge variety of tools, including pencils, crayons, stickers, patterns, and paints\n- tracing and free-drawing mechanics to help prepare your child’s hand for writing with step-by-step motor-skill refinement, from the moment they first scribble to their finalized masterpieces\n- activities that form a customized age-based learning program, taking your child’s interests into account\n- unique easy-to-follow tracing exercises that guide your child’s creativity without limitations and stimulating free drawing\n\nDrawing Academy isn’t just another coloring book!\n\nNote: only part of the content in the screenshots is available in the free version of the application. To gain access to the full version, you will need to make an in-app purchase.\n\nSubscription Details\n\nGet access to over 100 cute characters and drawings after subscribing to the Drawing Academy.

Hemos creado el SISTEMA DE ENSEÑANZA DE LA GRAMÁTICA más claro y sencillo, conveniente a los principiantes. No le hace falta adentrarse en los mínimos detalles de la gramática inglesa, ni leer libros de texto. Descompusimos el inglés en átomos, seleccionamos solo la info más relevante, la reconstituimos y convertimos en estructuras fáciles e inteligibles. Cada regla gramatical del curso autodidacta Simpler es una instrucción corta que enseguida se refuerza con preguntas y prácticas.\n\n2. Hemos creado un SISTEMA sencillo y claro de MEMORIZACIÓN DEL VOCABULARIO INGLÉS. Aparte de la traducción, se visualiza una imagen especial que ilustra el significado de la palabra desconocida. Además, se le muestra un texto asociativo que acompaña la imagen y le permite idear sus propias asociaciones mnemónicas. El curso autodidacta Simpler organiza el repaso del vocabulario en intervalos que fueron calculados con la curva del olvido de Ebbinghaus. ¡Con Simpler su vocabulario de inglés se ampliará notablemente!\n\n3. Es imprescindible poder entender el lenguaje oral en inglés. Para ello, los audios de las frases fueron grabados por hablantes nativos, lo que es especialmente importante para aquellos que empiezan a estudiar inglés desde cero. Asimismo, creamos un apartado especial de audiciones que llamamos PRÁCTICAS. Después de estudiar las reglas gramaticales, se le ofrece una tarea auditiva con el fin de entender frases en inglés.\n\n4. Creamos un sistema de tareas de toda clase que llamamos ENTRENADOR. Incluye una gama de actividades variadas que suponen un entrenamiento de traducción de frases del español al inglés y viceversa. Además, las reglas están pensadas de tal manera que el estudiante pueda aprender a aplicarlas con facilidad. Las lecciones del Simpler no se pasan al olvido, gracias a que el ENTRENADOR incluya también actividades de lecciones anteriores.\n\n5. ¡EXCLUSIVIDAD! Historias policíacas en inglés adaptado. Le harán pensar en inglés, con ellas podrá ampliar su vocabulario y mejorar la destreza oral.\n\n6. ¡La eficacia está en la regularidad!

      "label": "Learn American English with free lessons daily. Let Mondly teach you the American English language quickly and effectively. In just minutes you’ll start memorizing core American English words, form sentences, learn to speak American English phrases and take part in conversations.\n\nExplore language exercises for reading, listening, writing and speaking enhanced with a dictionary, verb conjugator and state-of-the-art speech recognition technology - you’ll feel like having your own American English language tutor in your pocket.\nDownload the language learning pill today and enjoy the benefits of learning a new language for life.\n\n▶ The secret path to language learning\nRemember the American English language classes in school? You started with hundreds of basic words and expressions, continued with tons of American English grammar lessons and at the end of a full semester’s language course you could barely translate a sentence or say “Hello!” to a foreigner. That’s the traditional way to learn a language.\nMondly has a different approach, that’s opposite to the average language course.\n\nHere are the key features that make Mondly a great tutor for you:\n\n• Crystal-clear audio and professional voice actors. Learn the right American English pronunciation from conversations between native speakers.\n\n• State-of-the-art Speech Recognition. Mondly knows exactly how to listen to your American English words and phrases. You will only get a positive feedback if you speak American English clearly and correctly. This will improve your pronunciation.\n\n• Useful phrases for real situations. Memorizing hundreds of isolated words is not the way to go when it comes to learning American English. Mondly teaches you American English vocabulary by offering you core words and phrases. The app breaks the learning process down into short lessons and puts them into themed packs.\n\n• Learn conversational American English. Conversation is the main reason to take this free course.\n\n• Verb conjugations. If you want to learn more during this course, just tap the American English verbs and get the full conjugation on the screen, including the translation. It’s faster and better than a dictionary.\n\n• Advanced Statistics. The App uses intelligent reporting, so you can always follow your progress. Build your vocabulary step by step and become better daily.\n\n• The Leaderboard. See how your friends are doing and compete with people from all over the world to become the best learner in the Mondly community family.\n\nBefore you know it, at the end of these English lessons, you will master the most useful 5000 words and phrases and you will be on the fast lane to learning a new language.\n\nPLEASE NOTE\n\nYou will need a subscription in order to get access to all of this app’s courses and features.\n\nSubscription options:\n- One-monthly subscription for $US9.99 (or the equivalent in local currency), automatically renewed until canceled.\n- One-yearly subscription for $US47.99 (or the equivalent in local currency), automatically renewed until canceled.\n\nYour subscription will automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current payment period.\n\nYour iTunes account will be automatically charged at the same price for renewal within the 24-hour period prior to the end of the current payment period unless you change your subscription preferences in your Account Settings.\nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\nAny unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\nYou can manage your subscriptions through your Account Settings after purchase.\n\nWhen a subscription is canceled, access to the app’s courses and features will expire at the end of the current payment period.\n\nPrivacy Policy: www.mondly.com/privacy\nTerms: www.mondly.com/terms\n\nWe welcome your feedback and suggestions at: ios[at]mondly[dot]com"

Los niños pequeños responden bien a este método con animales, y enseñarles el alfabeto de esta manera sigue siendo práctico. Se utilizan hermosas ilustraciones y sonidos divertidos para crear interés en sus hijos.\r\n\r\nEsta aplicación contiene 3 módulos:\r\n\r\n(i) ABC: aprender el alfabeto \r\n\r\nEn este módulo, sus hijos entrarán en contacto con el abecedario y escucharán cómo deletrear. Mentalmente, ellos aprenderán el alfabeto al asociarlo con un animal cuyo nombre comience con determinada letra del alfabeto.\r\n\r\n(ii) Elige el animal \r\n\r\nEn este módulo, sus hijos aprenderán a relacionar cada letra con un animal. Se escucha un sonido de aplausos para animarlos cada vez que ellos hagan la combinación correcta.\r\n\r\n(iii) Deletrea el nombre \r\n\r\nEn este módulo, sus seres queridos aprenderán a escribir los nombres de los animales que están presentes en la aplicación. Primero, las letras saldrán en el orden correcto desde la cabeza del animal, luego, se barajarán las letras y sus hijos intentarán escribir el nombre del animal colocando las letras en el orden correcto en los cuadros de fondo. Este módulo está hecho para que sus hijos reciben la ayuda necesaria para memorizar cómo escribir correctamente los nombres de muchos animales."

Our apps have zero ads and no flashy features, thus providing a safe and non-intrusive learning experience. We use ABA therapy-inspired positive reinforcement that rewards kids with fun games and stickers for trying. Having the app at your fingertips makes it easy to practice in a routine that suits you, and helps avoid stressful disruptions that can upset your child.\nOur apps use multiple child and platform support, so with one sign-in ALL of your kids can use the app, no matter if it's on your device, a partner’s, or grandparents’. One sign-in also includes our new reading app READING BLUBS – designed with over 200 teachers and literacy experts.\nYou can now get access to language versions in US and UK English, Spanish, French, & (Brazilian) Portuguese. \n\nKEY FEATURES:\nParents’ Academy:\nA newly-added parent section provides access to an ever-growing content library of 350+ articles on parenting, homeschooling, education, speech therapy, and more.

Also, check out our practical video tips!\n\n\nKids’ area:\nThere are over 1500+ exercises, activities, videos, mini-games, and dozens of NEW face filters.

When children watch their peers in real-time, their MIRROR NEURONS fire up! This scientifically proven and effective approach was confirmed in a UCLA study published by the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association and showed that kids learn faster and better when learning from other kids.\n\nSUBSCRIPTION, PRICING, & TERMS\nSpeech Blubs starts with a 7-day free trial.

You'll always have Mendeleev's Periodic Table and Solubility table handy. And even the calculator of molar masses!\n\nThe app can find the equations of chemical reactions even if the right or left part is unknown, it helps you with organic and inorganic chemistry. The discovered reactions will be displayed in a usual and ionic form. Organic chemistry formulas are drawn as images by the app.\n\nConvenient interactive Periodic Table. Tap a chemical element in the table to find more information about it. Use a search button to find an element by name or symbol.\n\nThe calculator of molar masses. Enter a chemical compound correctly and it will show molar masses and percentages of elements.\n\nThe table of solubility of substances is added in the app as well as Acid strength chart. Now your textbooks become waste!\n\nThe best solver of chemical equations for iPhone and iPad.\n\nAdd new shiny Widgets to the desktop and learn information about chemical elements from Periodic Table subconsciously. It's a fun way to learn and remember chemical elements data.\n\nAll these tables and charts are available in the free Chemistry app:\n* Periodic table\n* Atoms in Augmented Reality\n* Chemical reactions search\n* Offline access to information about chemical elements\n* Solubility table\n* Molar mass calculator\n* Electronegativity of elements\n* Molecular weights of organic substances\n* Reactivity series\n* Acid strengths chart\n* Acids, anions, salts list\n* Standard electrode potential\n* Widgets to easily remember the periodic table and chemical elements\n\nThe chemistry falls into to number of the most important sciences and is one of the main school objects. Its studying begins with the Periodic Table. Interactive approach to a training material is more effective than classical. As in it technologies which became the family for the modern pupils are used.\n\nThe periodic table of elements is one of the most important tools in chemistry. The periodic table is essential for understanding the structure and behavior of atoms and molecules. It also provides a useful framework for predicting the properties of new and unknown elements.\n\nRead more about our terms and conditions here:\nTerms of Use: http://getchemistry.io/terms-and-conditions/ios/\nPrivacy policy: http://getchemistry.io/privacy-policy/ios/"

Graded entirely on your pronunciation, our app makes language learning fresh and fun.\n\nLearn to speak Spanish, French, German and English like a native speaker. Unlike traditional language learning apps, that teach you ‘classroom’ speak, Univoice teaches you to speak a new language as it’s spoken in the real world, including idioms and slang words.\n\nJust load up the app, select the language and genre of music that suits your mood and start singing along with the artist. As you sing or speak, you can see the translation of the lyrics back into your native language.\n\nWe’ll grade you on your pronunciation, not your pitch or tone, so you can see how well you’ve done and how you improve over time!\n\nLong gone are the days of memorizing long vocabulary lists, repeating the same keywords and phrases, or reading pages of grammar rules.

Hemos creado el SISTEMA DE ENSEÑANZA DE LA GRAMÁTICA más claro y sencillo, conveniente a los principiantes. No le hace falta adentrarse en los mínimos detalles de la gramática inglesa, ni leer libros de texto. Descompusimos el inglés en átomos, seleccionamos solo la info más relevante, la reconstituimos y convertimos en estructuras fáciles e inteligibles. Cada regla gramatical del curso autodidacta Simpler es una instrucción corta que enseguida se refuerza con preguntas y prácticas.\n\n2. Hemos creado un SISTEMA sencillo y claro de MEMORIZACIÓN DEL VOCABULARIO INGLÉS. Aparte de la traducción, se visualiza una imagen especial que ilustra el significado de la palabra desconocida. Además, se le muestra un texto asociativo que acompaña la imagen y le permite idear sus propias asociaciones mnemónicas. El curso autodidacta Simpler organiza el repaso del vocabulario en intervalos que fueron calculados con la curva del olvido de Ebbinghaus. ¡Con Simpler su vocabulario de inglés se ampliará notablemente!\n\n3. Es imprescindible poder entender el lenguaje oral en inglés. Para ello, los audios de las frases fueron grabados por hablantes nativos, lo que es especialmente importante para aquellos que empiezan a estudiar inglés desde cero. Asimismo, creamos un apartado especial de audiciones que llamamos PRÁCTICAS. Después de estudiar las reglas gramaticales, se le ofrece una tarea auditiva con el fin de entender frases en inglés.\n\n4. Creamos un sistema de tareas de toda clase que llamamos ENTRENADOR. Incluye una gama de actividades variadas que suponen un entrenamiento de traducción de frases del español al inglés y viceversa. Además, las reglas están pensadas de tal manera que el estudiante pueda aprender a aplicarlas con facilidad. Las lecciones del Simpler no se pasan al olvido, gracias a que el ENTRENADOR incluya también actividades de lecciones anteriores.\n\n5. ¡EXCLUSIVIDAD! Historias policíacas en inglés adaptado. Le harán pensar en inglés, con ellas podrá ampliar su vocabulario y mejorar la destreza oral.\n\n6. ¡La eficacia está en la regularidad!

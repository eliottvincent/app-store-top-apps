Classroom makes it easy for learners and instructors to connect—inside and outside of schools. Classroom saves time and paper, and makes it easy to create classes, distribute assignments, communicate, and stay organized.\n\nClassroom is designed to help teachers create, collect, and grade assignments paperlessly, including time-saving features like the ability to automatically make a copy of a Google Document for each student. It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organized.\n\nStudents can keep track of what’s due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and grades right in Classroom.\n\nWith the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and grade the assignment - at school or on the go. Students and teachers receive notifications when they have new content in Classroom, so they are always up to date.\n\nThere are many benefits of using Classroom:\n\nEasy to set up\nTeachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It takes just minutes to set up.\n\nSaves time\nThe simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review, and grade assignments quickly, all in one place.\n\nImproves organization\nStudents can see all of their assignments on an assignments page, and all class materials (e.g., documents, photos, and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.\n\nEnhances communication\nClassroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.\n\nSecure\nLike the rest of Google Workspace for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes.\n\nPermissions Notice:\nCamera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.\nMicrophone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.\nPhotos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom. Photos or videos posted to Classroom will be stored on Google servers in order to show them in Classroom."

We will continue in the hopes that there will soon be peace for our children and children all around the world!\n\nDrawing Academy from Bini Games (ex-Bini Bambini) is a unique app where kids are inspired to learn by drawing. In our app, drawing gets children excited even for letters and numbers!\n\nIn preschoolers, drawing plays an important role in the development of the right side of the brain. As they draw, children process information in multiple ways, such as with their eyes and body, as well as emotionally. We created the Drawing Academy app with all this in mind.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n- 150 step-by step drawing tutorials in 10 thematic sets with different complexity levels for kids aged 2 to 6\n- “ABC\" and \"Numbers” packs to get children interested in learning letters and numbers through drawing with pictures they make themselves\n- a huge variety of tools, including pencils, crayons, stickers, patterns, and paints\n- tracing and free-drawing mechanics to help prepare your child’s hand for writing with step-by-step motor-skill refinement, from the moment they first scribble to their finalized masterpieces\n- activities that form a customized age-based learning program, taking your child’s interests into account\n- unique easy-to-follow tracing exercises that guide your child’s creativity without limitations and stimulating free drawing\n\nDrawing Academy isn’t just another coloring book!\n\nNote: only part of the content in the screenshots is available in the free version of the application. To gain access to the full version, you will need to make an in-app purchase.\n\nSubscription Details\n\nGet access to over 100 cute characters and drawings after subscribing to the Drawing Academy. Just download and go!\n\nA free 7-day trial period is available to you, or you can subscribe right after download.\n\nAfter your free trial, your subscription will automatically start unless you adjust your subscription settings at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.\n\nWe provide different subscription options for your convenience: monthly and annual subscription.\n\nIf you change your mind at any point, cancellation is easy through your iTunes settings.\n\nPayment for subscriptions will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\n\nYour subscription automatically renews unless you turn the renewal feature off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.\n\nYou will be charged for renewal within 24 hours of the end of the current period.\n\nYou can cancel your subscription anytime through your Account Settings without any cancellation fees.\n\nYou can use your subscription on any device registered with your Apple ID.\n\nABOUT BINI GAMES \n\nBini Games (ex-Bini Bambini) was started in 2012 by four parents with experience in children's education. And today, we are a 250-people team of dedicated designers, artists, animators, and educators. To date, we have more than 30 apps, with our user base having reached 98M.\n\nWe are inspired by the idea of bringing fun into early education and enhancing a child's natural love of learning through educational apps for kids.\n\nIf you need help, have questions or just want to say “hi!”, get in touch at feedback@bini.games\nhttps://binibambini.com/terms-of-use/\nhttps://binibambini.com/privacy-policy/\n\nAll our games are safe, and do not collect any personal information."

Graded entirely on your pronunciation, our app makes language learning fresh and fun.\n\nLearn to speak Spanish, French, German and English like a native speaker. Unlike traditional language learning apps, that teach you ‘classroom’ speak, Univoice teaches you to speak a new language as it’s spoken in the real world, including idioms and slang words.\n\nJust load up the app, select the language and genre of music that suits your mood and start singing along with the artist. As you sing or speak, you can see the translation of the lyrics back into your native language.\n\nWe’ll grade you on your pronunciation, not your pitch or tone, so you can see how well you’ve done and how you improve over time!\n\nLong gone are the days of memorizing long vocabulary lists, repeating the same keywords and phrases, or reading pages of grammar rules. Now you can learn through song – scientifically proven to be one of the most effective ways to learn how to speak a new language!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\nHow does the Univoice app work?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n**No singing skill required! We grade only on pronunciation**\n• Pick from Spanish, French, German, and English\n• Choose from a wide range of 30+ music genres\n• Sing (or speak) with the artist in the language you’re learning\n• Follow the translation into your native language as you speak\n• Familiarize yourself with idioms & slang words you won’t find in a textbook\n• Expand your vocabulary & learn new phrases the fun way... through music!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\nWhat motivates Univoicers to learn a new language?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n• Becoming a global citizen & raising globally-minded children\n• Connecting with others in a more meaningful, organic way\n• Staying tightly connected to heritage & strengthening family ties\n• Communicating more fluidly with coworkers, clients, patients\n• Learning to speak (and sing) a dream language like a native\n• Immersing oneself in the culture, while learning the language\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\nWhat subscription plans does Univoice offer?\n----------------------------------------------------------\nAll app users will receive 5 minutes / day, free of charge.\n\nOur auto-renewable premium plans feature unlimited song access, across the following term lengths:\n\n• Weekly: $2.99\n• Monthly: $8.99\n• 3 Months: $17.99 \n• 6 Months: $35.99\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nEntertain & educate yourself with Univoice.

      "label": "THE CUBE\nRubik’s cube was invented in 1974 by Hungarian sculptor and professor of architecture Ernő Rubik. Originally called the 'Magic Cube'.\n\nTHE METHOD\nReally easy to learn method for solving the Rubik’s cube taught in a fun and easy way even for a baby.\nThis method consists in 7 easy movements: White Cross, Middle Layer, Yellow Cross Position, Yellow Cross Orientation, Position Corners and Final Movement.\n\nThe method’s great advantage is its simplicity. As an example the Final Movement only needs 4 rotations and not the usual 10 or 12 that no one can remember.\n\nThe cube has 6 faces with 6 colors and 26 pieces:\nCenter: Pieces with 1 color located in each face’s center. It tells us the cube’s face’s color.\nCorner: Pieces with 3 colors located in the cube’s corners. There are 8 in total.\nBorder: Pieces with 2 colors located between cube corners. There are 12 in total.\n\nThe movement’s sequences are explained step by step. In each step you can see which face you have to rotate and a title. Try to remember these titles and the rotation comes alone.\n\nYour suggestions are more than welcome at info@fithx.com.\nSubject: Solve The Cube\nPlease tell us the case and the page number in the message."

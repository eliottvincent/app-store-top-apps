      "label": "** The most downloaded kegel app in the World ** - according to Sensor Tower analytics\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dr. Kegel app provides 5 exceptional features that form a powerful men’s health-boosting machine.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. KEGEL TRAINING PLAN - The core feature to improve performance\r\n\r\nKegel Training provides a step-by-step plan for strengthening Pelvic Floor (PF) muscles. PF muscles play a critical role in male intimate health. They help trap blood in the groin area & control male organs.\r\n\r\nWithout training, PF muscles lose tone. This can lead to weak rigidity (ED), “quick finishes'' (PE), & other male diseases.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut since the Pelvic Floor is a group of muscles, it means that you can strengthen them just like any other muscle in the body & boost men’s health. Dozens of the latest urological studies prove this can help last longer, get & stay up easier.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's SUPER EASY to work out with Kegel Training\r\n\r\n\r\n* The workouts take just 5 minutes a day. Which is perfect even for the busiest ones;\r\n* The workouts are simple. Just do PF exercises to the rhythm of your phone’s vibrations;\r\n* You don’t need any additional equipment to work out;\r\n* You can work out even laying on the couch. You don’t even have to move, literally;\r\n* No one will notice that you’re working out. This means that you can do it even in a crowded office.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. GROIN FITNESS - Special fitness that helps to boost men’s health faster\r\n\r\n\r\nGroin Fitness includes a set of specially selected exercises that are directly targeted at the groin area. It helps to achieve 2 goals at the same time:\r\n\r\n1. Increase blood flow to the groin;\r\n2. Strengthen the PF muscles in an extra way.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis multiplies the effect of Kegel Training and helps to achieve desired results faster.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Performing Groin Fitness requires no equipment;\r\n* The video & audio instructions from our professional coach will help you do exercises correctly;\r\n* And the workouts take just 2-5 minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis makes Groin Fitness perfect even for beginners.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. PROGRESS TRACKER - Monitor how workouts strengthen PF muscles\r\n\r\n\r\nProgress Tracker allows to take measurements & see how your PF muscles become stronger. \r\n\r\n\r\nIt provides daily, weekly, and monthly statistics overviews. So you can see the visible progress & increase the motivation to reach the goal.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. DAILY CHALLENGES - Everyday activities that boost men's health\r\n\r\n\r\n​​Besides the PF muscles, men's health also depends on eating behaviors, mental health, physical activity & social life.\r\n\r\n\r\nDaily Challenges provide a set of special activities that help to build healthy habits in those areas of life, that have the greatest impact on men's health.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. INSIGHTS - Summary of scientific facts about Health, Relationship, Nutrition & more.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Insights tab, you’ll find main highlights from the hundreds of latest scientific research made into 2-minute stories with juicy illustrations.\r\n\r\n\r\nIncorporate the tips from these stories into your daily life to become more productive or simply to amaze others with your knowledge.\r\n\r\nAS YOU CAN SEE DR. KEGEL PROVIDES A COMPLEX SOLUTION TO BOOST MALE INTIMATE HEALTH\r\n\r\n\r\nIt’s a revolutionary way to improve performance, last longer, get & stay up easier.

Simple will keep track of your eating habits to help you adjust your customized fasting program as needed. We will provide you with personalized insights on how to get the most out of intermittent fasting. \n\n- Customized tips and hacks delivered daily\n- Smart and flexible tracking.

Trainers are then able to review all members’ activities so they can help them improve performance, keep their weight under control, and enjoy a healthy and energetic lifestyle.\n\nThe app works with all chest and arm-based Uptivo heart rate sensors to provide accurate and engaging cardio frequency-based effort tracking and monitor individual training sessions. Real-time training monitoring makes workouts competitive and engaging and boosts members’ motivation while building a collaborative environment.\n\nMonitor your workouts\n\nThe Uptivo app provides real-time information on your workout and training session so that you can conveniently adjust your effort to suit your training goals, such as tracking your actual heart rate, HR training zone split, duration, or calories burned.\n\nRecord and upload your training to the cloud\n\nThe Uptivo app automatically synchronizes each new training session with your Uptivo account to provide a complete overview of your progress with daily and weekly reports as well as an accurate and detailed analysis of all your workouts.\n\nClub rankings\n\nAre you a competitive individual? Take a look at your Club rankings for sessions, calories, Uptivo Performance Points, and more! Find your friends and see how they are doing month by month.\n\nClub activities\n\nYou can browse through your Club activities to sign up or to get on the waiting list. Credits and subscriptions to attend to you Club activities can be purchased directly via the Uptivo app.\n\nIntegrations\n\nThe Uptivo app is available for Fitbit Ionic/Versa and for Apple Watch (watchOS 5 or greater). The Uptivo app receives heart rate data through Apple Health when using the Apple Watch.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

La App de IND facilita muchísimo el cumplimiento de tu planificación mostrándote:\n\n• La descripción de cada receta con su foto, ingredientes, cantidades, elaboración, indicadores nutricionales, etc.\n• Añadidos a cada comida: cafés, postres, acompañamientos, suplementos...\n• La lista de la compra con las cantidades exactas para realizar tu menú semanal\n• Entrenamientos que tienes cada día con el preentreno o postentreno planificados\n• Indicadores nutricionales de tu plan\n\nAdemás, ofrece una serie de funcionalidades que ayudan a alimentar tu perfil para que tus próximos menús sean cada vez más personalizados:\n\n• Marcación del cumplimiento de cada comida y cada entrenamiento\n• Marcación de tus recetas Favoritas\n• Cambio de recetas automático sin alterar ni 1 kcal tu arquitectura nutricional\n\nPero la nutrición no funciona de forma aislada, hay muchas variables en tu vida que influyen en ella y en tu rendimiento. Es por eso que en IND controlamos las 6 variables más importantes del deportista:\n\n1. Alimentación y Nutrición\n2. Composición Corporal\n3. Entrenamientos\n4. Descanso\n5. Biomarcadores\n6. Motivación\n\nEn esta aplicación podrás visualizar a través de intuitivos gráficos cuál está siendo tu evolución en cada una de estas 6 variables: cómo está evolucionando tu porcentaje de grasa, cuántas kcal estás comiendo en cada menú, cuánto estás cumpliendo, cómo estás entrenando, descansando y muchos más datos que compararán tu estado actual con tu estado inicial al comenzar el reto.\n\nPor último, pero no menos importante, desde la app tendrás contacto directo con tu nutricionista, pedirle una consulta online o solicitar cualquier duda sobre tu plan.\n\nTérminos de uso: www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/\nTérminos y condiciones: https://getindya.com/terminos-y-condiciones/"

      "label": "- WHAT IS LOÓNA?\nloóna is the first app that lets you quickly disconnect from a long stressful day and get in the right mood for sleep.\n\n- SO, IT'S ANOTHER SLEEP APP, RIGHT?\n Not exactly. loóna isn’t a list of direct go-to-sleep techniques, but rather a mood-altering app that helps you to stay calm during the day and prepares you emotionally for going to sleep in the evening.\n\n- WHY IS BEDTIME MOOD IMPORTANT?\nNegative emotions we accumulate during the day are processed and consolidated by our brain during sleep making them more difficult to disassociate from when faced again in the future. Moreover, feeling angry, anxious, down, or, the opposite, excited, and elated, is likely to affect latencies to sleep onset and REM-sleep. People mistake it for the symptoms of a sleep disorder, but in reality, they just may be in the wrong mood for sleep.\n\n- HOW DOES LOÓNA WORK?\nFrom the wake up and during the busy day Loóna will support your emotional states with playlists and immersive stories. Each night you’ll have a recommended sleepscape. A sleepscape is a guided session that combines activity-based relaxation, storytelling, and sounds in a unique way. Complete it to shut the frantic world out, reset your mind, and create the perfect mood for sleep.\n\nLoóna saves your sleepscape sessions to your Apple Health app.\n\nThe upgrade to loóna PLUS provides access to the entire collection of sleepscapes. Our subscription options are: 1-month subscription for $12.99, 1-year subscription with a 7 day trial for $39.99 (price may vary by location).\n\nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal. Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nTerms of service: http://loona.app/terms\nPrivacy policy: http://loona.app/privacy"

      "label": "ifeel: THERAPY FOR OUR TIMES \nifeel helps people overcome the challenges of everyday life with the support of licensed and specialised online psychologists. Something worrying you or creating feelings of anxiety or depression? Going through a tough time in your relationship? Is your self-esteem a bit low lately? Are your work or studies a source of stress? At ifeel you’ll find the help you need and deserve. We created ifeel so everyone can have access to the best personalised, professional, affordable and confidential psychological online therapy.\n\nGREAT PSYCHOLOGISTS, TINY PRICES\nPsychological support can be crucial during many periods of our life. For this reason at ifeel we want you to have access to professional help whenever you may need it: it’s a bit like having your licensed psychologist in your pocket. You’ll be able to talk to your dedicated psychologist through a chat or videocall - whatever works best for you - anytime and anywhere.\nOnline psychology allows connecting everyone with the professional that is best suited for their individual needs, increasing the possibility of a successful therapy process. At ifeel we think everyone deserves dedicated and customised attention. You can subscribe to our online therapy plans from € 24.99/week and start your therapy right away. Online therapy offers more convenience, higher flexibility and much more affordable prices. You won’t need to worry about scheduling a session, commuting or arranging your day around a face-to-face meeting with your psychologist.\n\nHOW IT WORKS\nAt ifeel we believe therapy should be an ongoing and seamless process. Once you are assigned your dedicated therapist, you will enter an online therapy “virtual room” created specifically for you. This room will be open 24 hours a day and is a completely private and confidential space, where only you and your personal psychologist will be able to communicate. This is the virtual space where you and your dedicated therapist will work together to achieve your objectives.\nAll the professionals on our platform are licensed psychologists with years of experience in online therapy. They undergo a rigorous selection process and receive periodical training. They also constantly attend supervision and follow-up sessions.\n\nHOW CAN ifeel HELP ME?\nOur online psychologists have helped our patients in these areas:\n- therapy to overcome depression without medication\n- therapy to learn how to deal with anxiety (e.g. social anxiety, phobias, panic attacks, etc.)\n- solve relationship issues with our couples therapy\n- relaxation techniques to manage and relieve stress\n- techniques to improve your social skills and effective communication\n- methods for self-improvement and many more…\n\nNOT READY FOR THERAPY YET?\nAsking for help takes courage. If you’re still not ready to take the step and need a little help you can start by using our free tools. We offer a vast array of free exercises to reduce stress, control anxiety, different relaxation techniques, a breathing assistant, relevant blog articles and mindfulness exercises. All the tools are designed by licensed, clinical psychologists with the aim of supporting you throughout the day-to-day challenges. All the tools are completely free and for you to use at your own convenience.\n\nCONTACT\nAny question or feedback? Please reach us at info@ifeelonline.com. We will always try to get back as quickly as possible."

      "label": "Music-making for everyone. From new musicians looking to get started to experienced producers, Medly has everything you need to unleash your musical spark.\n\nA Best of App Store 2016 winner, Medly’s simple interface is packed with advanced tools to create studio-quality productions. Get started for free with the Starter Pack of 17 instruments and over 100 loops and samples. You can also try Medly Member free for 7 days to unlock over 3000 instruments, loops, and exclusive features.\n\nCREATIVE CONTROL\nMusic-making can be intimidating. Medly makes it easy by breaking songs down into Sections. You can add notes, audio samples, and loops to your Sections, then copy, paste and rearrange them to build your song. At any time, use the History tool to quickly rewind and undo your changes.\n\nA MAGIC TOUCH TO NOTES\nFrom simply adding a note to complex multi-note editing, each interaction was carefully designed with touch in mind. And with over 300 instruments available to Members, you can quickly try out different sounds and find your style.\n\nAMPLIFIED AUDIO\nEdit, snap, and trim your audio clips to your liking. Record or import audio, or use a sample from Medly’s vast audio library. You can record audio up to 4 bars or become a Member and record and import audio up to 30 seconds. As a Member, bring your songs to the next level with professionally recorded vocals by Medly’s talented artists.\n\nPOINT PERFECT AUTOMATION\nAutomatically change volume, echo, and other effects to add fades and pitch bends to your sounds. Snap between points and beats to achieve point perfect precision and use the selection tool to edit multiple automation points together. Then open the effect picker to quickly see the automation graphs of all effects within a Section.\n\nSHARE AND PLAY\nQuickly upload your songs to SoundCloud, or share it as a video, audio, MIDI, or Medly file. You can also connect Medly to other apps using Inter-App Audio or play in time using Ableton Link.\n\nMADE IN CANADA\nWe’re a small team working relentlessly to make Medly possible. We’d love to know what you think about Medly, let us know on Facebook, Twitter, or email us at hi@medlylabs.com\n\n\n*iPad App of the Year: Japan and South Korea\n*iPhone App of the Year Runner-Up: China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan\n\nhttps://medlylabs.com/legal"

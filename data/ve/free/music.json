You can also hear your music performed with the most realistic playback possible, using real audio samples recorded by the London Symphony Orchestra at Abbey Road Studios.\n\nNotion Mobile is a native cross-platform app, meaning you can write anywhere on any device without requiring a constant Internet connection. And when you’re back online, you’ll be able to sync your work across multiple devices — either through your preferred cloud provider, or through the optional wireless transfer between PreSonus applications on any device. Start your work on one device and finish it on another. Once you are happy with your creation you can share the Notion file, or export as MIDI, MusicXML, PDF or as an audio file.\n\nCompose, edit, and play back your music performed with real piano and orchestral samples recorded by the London Symphony Orchestra at Abbey Road Studios — along with outstanding sampled guitar, bass, drums and other popular instruments.

You can optionally register (also for free!) to unlock an additional Soundset (containing Solo Strings, Classical Saxophones and Glockenspiel), the multivoice function that allows writing in up to 4 voices per staff, and access to the friendly Notion Mobile User Forum. Then for the full experience, either sign in with your PreSonus Sphere membership or purchase the Notion Feature Bundle. This unlocks Handwriting Recognition, all the Expansion Soundsets (including many auxiliary instruments and additional articulations and effects), additional audio export formats (m4a, OPUS, FLAC) and direct file transfer between any PreSonus application running on the same network (including Notion Mobile, Notion Desktop, and Studio One.)\n\nFree:\nUnlimited staves\nAll editing features\nCore Soundsets\nExport as MIDI, PDF, wav, mp3\n\nRegister for free:\nReward Soundset including Solo Strings, Glockenspiel, Classical Saxophones \nAccess to the new Notion Mobile User Forum\nAdditionally write for voices 3 and 4 in a single staff\nExport as MusicXML, Compressed MusicXML\n\nFeature Bundle (in-app purchase or sign in with PreSonus Sphere):\nHandwriting Recognition, powered by MyScript\nAvailable on iPhone, iPad and macOS (macOS with supporting graphics tablet or using Sidecar with compatible iPad)\nAutomatic pen vs. finger recognition to switch between handwriting and edit mode\nPressure-sensitive support for Apple Pencil\nAdjustable timer for Handwriting Recognition\nOverride handwriting timer by double tapping Apple Pencil (2nd Gen)\nAll Expansion Soundsets\nAdditional audio export formats (m4a, OPUS, FLAC)\nDirect file transfer between any PreSonus application running on the same network (including Notion Mobile, Notion Desktop, and Studio One)"

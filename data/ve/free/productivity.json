      "label": "Dropbox lets you upload, save, and transfer photos and files to the cloud. Back up and sync your pictures, videos, documents, and other files to cloud storage and access them from any device, anywhere. With advanced sharing features, it’s easy to share and send photos or files to family, friends, and co-workers.\n\nFeatures:\n• Automatically upload videos and photos from your camera roll to cloud photo storage—all in the background—for easy video sharing and photo sharing.\n• Access any file in your account—even offline—and preview over 175 different file types with no special software required.\n• Easily send large files by copying and pasting a link you can give to anyone, even if they don’t have a Dropbox account.\n• Scan documents, receipts, IDs, photos, and more using your mobile device and transform them into high-quality PDFs, so you can view and send anywhere.\n• Sync folders on your PC or Mac to Dropbox with computer backup, and recover older versions or restore deleted files with version history and file recovery.\n\nSign up now for your free Dropbox Plus trial. You’ll get 2 TB (2,000 GB) of storage space—that’s enough room to save files from all your linked devices. We’ve also introduced some new features as part of your Plus plan: Dropbox Passwords to store and sync passwords across all your devices and Dropbox Vault to secure and organize your most sensitive documents. And with Dropbox Rewind, you can roll back any file, folder, or your entire account, up to 30 days.\n\nExisting Plus customers can upgrade to Dropbox Professional. With 3 TB (3,000GB), you can store all your stuff—from work projects to personal photos—and have space to spare. You and your clients can comment on most file types without leaving Dropbox. And you can protect your work with a watermark, add shared link controls, or rewind your account up to 180 days.\n\nBefore starting a trial or completing payment, you’ll see the plan price. This amount will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase and on renewal and will vary by plan and country. Dropbox subscriptions renew monthly or yearly, depending on your plan. Your account will be charged for renewal 24 hours before the end of your current billing period. To avoid auto-renewal, turn it off in at least 24 hours before your subscription renews. You can turn off auto-renewal anytime from your iTunes account settings. You can manage and cancel your subscriptions by going to your account settings on the App Store after purchase.\n\nDropbox is a secure cloud solutions leader trusted by Fortune 500 companies for their most sensitive data. Over 14 million paid users choose Dropbox because they know they can count on a company that’s also dedicated to their security and privacy—no matter what they do or where they are. Let Dropbox be your all-in-one file storage, file organizer, file transfer, and file sharing solution for all your devices.\n\nWe’d love to hear from you!

      "label": "Use Microsoft Authenticator for easy, secure sign-ins for all your online accounts using multi-factor authentication, passwordless, or password autofill. You also have additional account management options for your Microsoft personal, work or school accounts.\n\nGetting started with multi-factor authentication\n\nMulti factor authentication (MFA)provides a second layer of security. When enabled, during login after entering your password, you’ll be asked for an additional way to prove it’s really you. Either approve the notification sent to the Microsoft Authenticator, or enter the one-time password (OTP) generated by the app. The OTP codes have a 30 second timer counting down. This timer is so you never have to use the same time-based one-time password (TOTP) twice and you don’t have to remember the number. The OTP doesn’t require you to be connected to a network, and it won’t drain your battery. You can add multiple accounts to your app, including non-Microsoft accounts like Facebook, Amazon, Dropbox, Google, LinkedIn, GitHub, and more.\n\nGetting started with passwordless\n\nUse your phone, not your password, to log into your Microsoft account. Just enter your username, then approve the notification sent to your phone. Your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN will provide a second layer of security in this two-step verification process. After you’ve signed in with two factor authentication (2FA), you’ll have access to all your Microsoft products and services, such as Outlook, OneDrive, Office, and more.\n\nGetting started with autofill\n\nMicrosoft Authenticator app can also autofill passwords for you. Sign-in on the Passwords tab inside the Authenticator app with your personal Microsoft account to start syncing passwords, including the passwords saved in Microsoft Edge. Make Microsoft Authenticator the default autofill provider and start autofilling passwords on apps and sites you visit on your mobile. Your passwords are protected with multi-factor authentication in the app. You will need to prove yourself with your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN to access and autofill passwords on your mobile. You can also import passwords from Google Chrome and other password managers.\n\nMicrosoft personal, work or school accounts\n\nSometimes your work or school might ask you to install the Microsoft Authenticator when accessing certain organization resources. You will need to register your device to your organization through the app and add your work or school account. Microsoft Authenticator supports cert-based authentication by issuing a certificate on your device. This will let your organization know that the sign-in request is coming from a trusted device and help you seamlessly and securely access additional Microsoft apps and services without needing to log into each."

You can get small-tasks such as asking the AI to rephrase text, generate essays, make meal plans, do logical calculations, translate text, etc.\n\n\nYou can also use it for research purposes such as fact checking, sentiment analysis, getting recipes, meal plans, learning about anything. Like said above, being based on OpenAI’s top-notch AI GPT3, the usage has no limits.\n\nSome Utilities people use it for:\n\n● Get instant replies to any queries (ANY MEANS ANYTHING)\n\n● Text Summarization: Don’t want to read long paragraphs? Just copy the paragraph text\nin it and ask the AI to translate it and you’ll be shocked.\n\n● Generate original Essays or Blog posts: Got an assignment? Don’t want to spend\ntime writing an essay, but want to pass Copyscape, turn-it-in tests? Well, just give AI the\ntopic using the command: Write an essay on “your topic” in 1500 words and it’ll do it/\n\n● Translate text into any language: Unlike other translation apps like Google Translate\nand Bing translate, ChatGPT actually understands the message you’ve written and its meaning and then translates it into a language of your choice. Besides, you can just write a             message like: Translate this “your text” in Italian, Spanish, Mexican, Hindi, Swedish, Chinese, Japanese, and it’ll give you the translation in all languages in less than a second.\n\n● Get answers to your questions: Whether you want to know “Who invented Bitcoin?” or want to know the length of the car you’re planning to purchase, ChatGPT AI (GPT3) can do it for you. For instance, a lot of use-cases of this app were generated using ChatGPT AI.\n\n● Get Recommendations (Whether you want to find a restaurant that serves good chinese, or want a playlist for your house party, or want to find a good product such as laptops, mobiles, cars, etc.)\n\n● Fact checking: Don’t believe anything you read, you can just paste your text and ask the AI if it’s true and the AI would get you valid information.\n\n● Recipe Creation: Give the list of ingredients you have at your house and ask the AI for what you can make from it, you’ll be surprised with the dishes you could make and it also has the step-by-step recipes.\n\n● Music Playlists: Ask the AI for songs similar to your favorite ones and you’ll get some nice recommendations that’ll make your day.\n\n● Learn about anything: Want to learn about anything? Just put in the query: Information about Burj Khalifa and you’ll be shocked.\nLike said above, there’s no limit to using this app. There are some use-cases that no one has talked about, but you’ll be able to do them. For instance, one of our beta users was able to generate a product description for his shopify products using this.\n\nThis application isn't created or published by OpenAI.\n\nPrivacy Policy : https://onlinebuilder.biz/magicChat/privacypolicy.php\n\nTerms of Use : https://onlinebuilder.biz/magicChat/termsofuse.php"

The app can also settle all Multiple Bets (e.g. Yankees, Lucky 31s) with up to 6 selections. \n\nThere's also a calculator for 'Dutching' and the option to purchase an Overround calculator.\n\nA Parlay (Accumulator) can be the route to a big payout for a small outlay. Selections can be entered in any number of the fields, so you can calculate anything from a single bet to a full twelvefold parlay (accumulator). As you enter odds, the returns and profit are calculated automatically. You can also select a Commission Rate to calculate the deduction that a bookmaker or betting exchange will make on your winnings.\n\nIt is possible to switch between Moneyline, Decimal and Fractional odds at any stage in the process - though it should be noted that an exact conversion may not be possible. \n\nMoneyline parlays let you concentrate on picking winners rather than worrying about the point spread. Remember, every team in the parlay must win for you to collect - if even one lets you down, you lose. So, they are not the bet for every occasion but if you've got some strong hunches they can be the most profitable way to go.\n\nThe app also features a 'Dutching' calculator. Dutching is the strategy of betting on more than one competitor in a race or event, with a staking plan that ensures that the potential returns (profit) are the same if any one of the chosen selections wins. It's ideal for betting on sports like golf where you might have a number of long priced fancies in a single tournament. Our calculator lets you make up to 8 selections and you can use either the total stake you wish to bet or the profit you wish to make as the basis of your calculation.\n\nYou can also purchase an 'Overround' Calculator - a very valuable tool if you wish to see if there is value in a particular market. Purchasing the Overround Calculator will permanently remove ALL the ads from the app."

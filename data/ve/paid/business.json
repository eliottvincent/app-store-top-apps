      "label": "SA Contacts is not only the best way to transfer contacts to and from your iPhone without iTunes---it's the only way!  No other app lets you so easily control your iPhone's most valuable data:\n\n1. Update, modify and maintain your contacts easily and conveniently on your computer using Excel, OpenOffice or any other Excel-compatible application.\n2. SA Contacts sends all of your contacts to you from your iPhone in a convenient zip file by email, USB, or through a webpage seen only on your local wifi network! Contact photos are sent, too!\n3. Never again rely on iTunes as your only local source of back up. Nor do you need to share your contacts with Yahoo or other websites in order to have a backup.  SA Contacts' zip file contains ALL of your contacts in a convenient, easy format.\n4. SA Contacts protects you from iTunes sync accidents which can delete your contacts if, for example, you no longer have access to an Exchange server.\n5. Restoring or changing contacts from the spreadsheet is as simple as uploading the file to your phone via USB, email or web. It couldn't be easier.\n6. You can print a hardcopy of your iPhone contacts. \n7. You can now export iPhone contacts to an Excel file which can then be imported to Outlook Contacts directly. \n8. You can also import contacts from an Excel file that has been exported from Outlook to your iPhone.\n9. You can now export/import iPhone contacts to/from a Gmail CSV-format file(UTF-8 encoded or Unicode encoded).\n10. You can upload export files over to Dropbox/GoogleDrive or download import files from Dropbox/GoogleDrive.\n11. You can password protect your export file.\n12. All Contact fields except Ringtones can be exported/imported.\n13. You can organise your contacts into groups easily on a spreadsheet and also assign a contact to multiple groups.\n14. You can remove all iPhone contacts or groups before importing your organized contacts. \n15. SA Contacts can support 30,000+ contact entries.\n16. All column headers and labels in the Excel file are localized.\n17. Export/Import contacts to/from a VCF file.\n18. Backup contacts before import.\n19. Manage groups easily. You can now create, edit, delete groups and add contacts to groups.\n20. Export an Excel file with all photos included - this makes the contacts in your spreadsheet look better.\n21. Import your own file by mapping column headers to contact fields.\n22. Specify your own column headers in export process.\n\nMore detail and up-to-date help guides are available in samapp.com."

In the US and Europe, there's a hotspot on almost every streetcorner. This app helps you find them quickly, using the built-in GPS of the iPhone. \n\nThe software leads you to the nearest of 100,000 wireless hotspots, in 15,000 cities and 132 countries, with the touch of a button. It's WiFi for Dummies. Get your mail and browse the web without being charged. The ideal WiFi-tool for frequent travellers and mobile professionals. \n\nThe app shows you the nearest free hotspot address, provides directions on Google Maps, and shows additional information, such as the hotspot provider, phone number and website. You can browse the full database manually by country and city, or choose to automatically show results based on your location.\n\nThe application doesn’t depend on WLAN scanning, which would limit the range to only 25 yards, but uses GPS to pinpoint all known hotspots up to 10 miles away. All the wireless accesspoints are locally stored on your iPhone, and GPS usage is also offline available, so no expensive data roaming is needed. When abroad, you save hundreds of dollars in roaming cost, because you will always find a broadband data connection for your laptop and iPhone.\n\nThis app will let you get your mail or surf the web as quickly as possible. Just run it and it'll connect you for to the internet. It doesn't get easier than this. \n\nPlease note: Does NOT work on iPod Touch because it has no GPS."

      "label": "5 Stars. “I can't tell you how often I use it, probably about as much as the phone app!\" \n- CharlieW, President. Waterman & Company (Real Estate Investment and Development)\n\n“This is the first 12C type calculator for the itouch that has actually made me put down my real 12C. One of the best features of this calculator is the register display where you can see what is in FV, I, PV, PMT, etc. That alone makes it worth the $14.95 price. Consider the many other features that it has over and above the real 12C and you have one sweet program here. Best of the 12C emulators out there - hands down! “\n- tsinvest\n\nIt started in early 2008 with a belief that:\n • there was one and only one insanely great financial calculator\n • the iPhone is the perfect platform to bring that calculator back to life\n • it's not good enough to just copy the old, you have to make it better\n • a financial calculator is a professional tool, not a game\n \nFrom this mindset came Calc-12E, the first 12C emulator on the App Store. It was expensive back then ($20-$25) and compared to a game it still is because, well, you usually get what you pay for. Specifically:\n\nForemost, if the math isn't right in the corner cases I can't trust the calculator. Calc-12E's algorithms were written for iOS by a (the?) key member of the original 12C development team who incorporated his solutions to the quirks in financial computation that historically tripped up lesser implementations. There are reasons the 12C was the absolute best, and Calc-12E draws directly on that heritage.\n \nWhile the original did what it could, 1980s technology made many features difficult, impractical or impossible to use. Calc-12E pioneered the following innovations to address shortcomings:\n    • you can always see what's in the financial registers (and stack if you choose) so you have instant assurance that you've entered your data correctly. This feature has been copied by nearly every emulator on the App Store, for good reason.\n    • visual cash flow editing radically eases how you deal with cash flows... believe it or not it is actually easy to manipulate cash flows with Calc-12E. There's a demo on YouTube, search for Calc12E.\n    • Investment mode allows you to simultaneously evaluate metrics on up to three cash flow scenarios at a time. You can compare cash flows side-by-side AND because of visual cash flow editing you can play what-if games\n    • the results of some calculations need to \"leave the phone\" to be useful. Amortization schedules, leasing terms, bond yields... everything can be sent via email using customizable templates\n    \nFinally, a professional tool receives continuing support and updates. It does not nag you to rate it, it does not invite you to pay to get more. It does not crash. Check out Calc-12E's version history and reviews of previous versions. This is a live, supported app with tens of thousands of long term customers and I have never charged for an upgrade or cloaked features behind ads or paywalls. It's not ethical at this level (in my humble opinion!).\n\nWhen you buy Calc-12E you get my best (and evolving!) rendition of the most popular handheld calculator ever made. It's core (the math) comes from the same mind as your trusty original and to that foundation you get usability advances that actually enhance the overall tool."

The stunning 3D robot can chat with you, answer detailed questions and can guide and help you. \n\nThe knowledge base behind the app contains 'Wolfram Alpha', which gives you an enormous amount of information in your pocket. \nWith Voice Answer, you have full and unlimited access to this knowledge. \n\nExamples of topics and specific questions and commands: \n\nText: 'Send text to George I will be late' \n\nEmail: 'Email John Let's get together this week.' \n\nCall: 'Call mom' \n\nTranslation: 'Translate I would like to go now into Spanish' \n\nPlay songs on your device: 'Play music by Adele' \n\nReminder: 'Set reminder to 5 pm' \n\nSocial media: 'Post to Facebook This is great', 'Tweet I am going home now' \n\nSearch: 'Google this','Wiki that' \n\nLocation: 'Where am I?' \n\nPlaces: 'Where is the nearest bank?' \n\nMathematics: 'Integrate sin x dx from x=0 to pi' \n\nUnits & Measures 'U.K. men's size 11 shoe in Japanese size' \n\nMoney & Finance 'What is the Apple stock price' \n\nDates & Times 'What is the current time in Tokyo?' \n\nCurrent Weather 'What will be the high temperature today?' \n\nHealth & Medicine 'What is the life expectancy of a U.S. female age 30?' \n\nPlaces & Geography 'Where is ZIP 60637?' \n\nSocioeconomic Data 'Compare the age pyramid of New York and Miami' \n\nPeople & History 'When did Gandhi die?' \n\nFood & Nutrition '2 slices of swiss cheese' \n\nPhysics: 'What is the speed of light?' \n\nMaterials: 'Show me Topaz' \n\nEducation: 'How many kids are repeating primary school in California?' \n\nCulture & Media: 'US constitution' \n\nOrganizations: 'New York University' \n\nAstronomy:'Star chart' \n\nTransportation: 'Compare total length of all roads in USA and China' \n\nWords & Linguistics: 'Show me words that rhyme with bear' \n\nEarth Sciences: 'When was the Jurassic Period?' \n\nLife Sciences:'Compare puma, lion, red fox' \n\nSports & Games:'San Francisco Giants' \n\nWeb & Computer Systems: 'What is the cheapest tablet?' \n\nColors: 'What do you get when you mix red and blue' \n\nThe answers are spoken out, and relevant images are given. \n\nYou can also just have a general chat with Eve. Test her witty personality or just ask her to tell a joke or two. \n\nCommon Questions and concerns: \n\nQ: Why do I get strange answers to my question? \nA: Voice Answer will first check it's knowledge servers, including Wikipedia and Wolfram Alpha's award winning service, for an answer. If these don't respond, either because the answer is unavailable or the servers are down, the chatbot will answer the question. These answers are generally more funny than useful. You can avoid strange answers by disabling the chatbot, and try your question later. We are further enhancing our current data sources with additional databases as these become available, as we want to offer our customers the very best. \n\nQ: What do I do when voice answer doesn't understand my voice? \nA: Voice Answer compares your voice against a database of spoken english words and sentences. It works better for some people than for others. In general it works better than the voice recognition used by many other apps, but it depends on your accent. Try to speak slow and use regular sentences. If this doesn't work, you can use the keyboard. As and when better voice recognition algorithms are developed and become available, we can and will plug these in. \n\nQ: The app crashes. What can I do? \nA: On some devices such as the iPad1 or 3GS, it may sometimes be required to do a hard reset to get it to work. If this fails, removing the app and installing it again will generally get it going. We are working on improving the stability on those devices. \n\nPlease contact us at support@sparklingapps.com for any questions or comments. If you have any problems with any of the functions of the app, we can assist you with it. We are proud of our product and want our customers to get the most out of it."

      "label": "SalesCalc is designed to help you to create irresistible deals\n- quickly \n- efficiently\n- accurately\nwithout having to remember formulas and equations\n\nAnyone can use it - it's really so simple.\nAll you need is an iPhone.\n\nIf you need to calculate:\n- Gross Margin\n- Markup %\n- Percent Change\n- Percent Total\nthen SalesCalc is the App for you. \n\n\nMost people in sales and purchasing rely on their favorite spreadsheets when they want to calculate margins, markups or discounts. Some folks have memorized the formulas and use a calculator for the task but we think that the iPhone presents an easier way to get the answers you need to close a deal quickly. Instead of having to remember formulas - you'll never make a mistake with SalesCalc.\n\nSalesCalc will deliver your answer in under a second, all you need to do is input numerical values into 2 of the 3 fields. To clear the fields, just shake the iPhone.\n\nSalesCalc puts a few of the most commonly used sales related calculations in the palm of your hand so the next time you are in deal making mode - reach out for SalesCalc and put together the best deal ever.\n\nHere's to your Sales Success... \n \n\nSome Definitions:\n- Gross Margin is the percentage of the selling price that can be applied toward covering your operating costs and profit. Basically, 20% gross profit margin means that for every dollar generated in sales, you have 20 cents left over to cover basic operating costs and profit. \nLarger gross margins are generally good for companies, with the exception of discount retailers which need to show that operation efficiency and financing allows them to operate with smaller margins. Since the Margin is the percentage of the price that is markup, it can never exceed 100%\n\n- Cost of Goods Sold includes variable and fixed costs directly linked to the product, such as material and labor. It does not include indirect fixed costs like office expenses, rent, administrative costs, etc.\n\n- Markup also known as Cost-Plus-Markup or Markup by Cost is the difference between the selling price and the cost divided by the cost of goods sold expressed as a percent. The initial markup of a retail product is also known as IMU. \n\n- Markdowns or Discounts are used to generate sales and or clear inventory and are usually expressed as a percentage of the Original Price.\n\n- Initial pricing is an extremely important step in merchandising. For retailers that use a traditional calculation, such as Keystoning, which is doubling cost to arrive at the selling price (100% IMU = 50% profit margin), this may or may not be adequate to be profitable, particularly after markdowns are taken. In reality, there are numerous examples of products that cannot be sold profitably, but need to be in the store to satisfy Customer needs. Therefore, other products need to be sold at higher MU%'s to cover the net losses of the products that lose money. SalesCalc gives you a few ways to price your products so that you can calculate your profitability using the method that best fits your business model."

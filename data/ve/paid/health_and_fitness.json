      "label": "Cardiograph is an application which measures your heart rate. You can save your results for future reference, keep track of multiple people with individual profiles, add notes and locations, and even print out your measurements for sharing or safe keeping.\n\nCardiograph uses your device's built-in camera to take pictures of your fingertip and calculate your heart's rhythm - the same approach used by professional medical equipment!\n\n\"I know you have the disclaimer on the screen but I don't care, Cardiograph saved my life. Your app was key to understanding what was going on and help the doctors understand too.\"\nBob Spadafora - *****\n\n\"Comparing heart rates with family over the holidays is fun.\"\nTxyak – ****\n\n\"Wanna impress a friend with a cool app. This is the one to get.\"\nMattyray – *****\n\n\"After having two heart valve replacements and a by-pass, I feel it is not only smart - but also necessary - to have such a reliable heart rate monitor with me everywhere I go.\"\nDantv – *****\n\n\"I am an EMT and it helps me actually see what is going on. It is by no means definitive like a monitor but it is a great indicator of problems I would not see otherwise.\"\nGranniem – ****\n\n\"I had a pulse oximeter on one hand, medical quality, and my iPhone app in the other and the app was dead-on accurate.\"\nLike it but hate it – *****\n\n\n=== See Cardiograph in action ===\nhttp://macropinch.com/cardiograph \nhttp://youtu.be/isIjcCFYEho\n\n\n• Measure your heart rate\n\nIt's never been easier to know what your heart rate is! Without any external hardware, just using the built-in camera of your smartphone or tablet, you can get accurate readings almost instantly.\n\nKnowing how fast your heart is beating can be very useful when exercising, if you're under stress, if you have a heart-related medical condition, or even just out of curiosity.\n\n\n• Track your results\n\nEvery measurement you take is saved to your personal history, so you can keep track over time. In addition to the date and time of the measurement, you can also save the location at which it was taken (and see them on a map), and even add a quick note to effortlessly organize your history.\n\n\n• Multiple profiles\n\nCardiograph is perfectly tailored to allow multiple people to use the app on a shared device. You can create profiles for each of your family members or friends, and each of them has their own individual measurement history.\n\n\n• Export & Print\n\nEach measurement can be exported in full detail to a portable format that you can later send via e-mail, upload on the web or even print right from the app itself (with an AirPrint™ compatible printer).\n\n\n• Clean and intuitive design\n \nInspired by real-life medical equipment, Cardiograph is a pleasure to use. The streamlined and clutter-free design makes it seem instantly familiar, so you can focus on using the app instead of navigating through series of confusing screens.\n\n\n• Built-in user guide\n\nIf you're having trouble with the app, or you want to make the most out of it, you can access the comprehensive help manual right from within the app itself.\n\n\n• Universal application with iCloud® sync\n\nCardiograph is an universal application - it runs on the iPhone, the iPad, and the iPod touch.\nInstall Cardiograph on multiple devices with iOS 5.0+, and all your profiles and measurements will be in sync! Manage your profiles and measurements on one device, and the changes are instantly reflected on all the others.\n\n\nPlease note: If your device doesn't have a built-in camera flash, you need to take your measurements in a well lit environment (bright sunlight or close to a light source).\n\n\nFollow the latest news:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/macropinch \nhttp://twitter.com/macropinch"

Supports music playback, so you can listen while you exercise.\n\nAdjustable sensitivity and automatic calibration allows for accuracy whether walking, jogging, or running, and multiple position settings ensure that your steps are counted whether you carry your iPhone in your pocket, belt, on your arm, or in your hand!\n\nKeeps a history of your daily totals and timed runs.\n\nAutomatic screen dimming saves battery life while continuing to count your steps, and our locking mechanism prevents accidental button pressing while in your pocket.\n\nSupports both English and Metric units.\n\nNow with GPS support for even better distance tracking! Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

      "label": "We believe that the term \"meditation\" is a result of differing sets of practices that are found across many cultures and traditions, different but all striving to achieve the same goal...which is temporary inner peace or escape.

I enjoy the various quality sounds and the ability to combine them to fit my mood. It's even good just to unwind with for a few minutes. Very soothing! \"\n \n\" I love this app! combining different sounds gives you an experience that you can't get from traditional, more expensive sound machine. also, I love that you can save your combinations! and, you can set a timer and then it just goes off. fan-friggin-tastic! buy this! \"\n\n\" This is a great little app. I especially like the ability to mix sounds, each with their own level control. I use it quite a bit because it's very good for masking noise at any time of the day. \"\n\nDownload Sleep Machine ® today, and change your life overnight with a deep restorative sleep!"

With over 220 exercises, 90+  movies and 20 calculators and hundreds of pages of reference material, Navy SEAL Fitness helps you to train like a Navy SEAL.\n\nTo train for these physically demanding tasks, the Navy created The Navy SEAL Physical Fitness Guide.   The authors of this comprehensive guide, physicians and physiologists, were chosen because of their special qualifications in the area of physical fitness and their knowledge of the SEAL community. Their expertise ensured the guide was written with a goal of expanding the individual Navy SEAL's knowledge of attaining and retaining a high level of fitness.\n\nBecause SEALs train for mission related performance, the objective for every workout is elite fitness, validated by the ability to perform every task at the level necessary to accomplish any mission – no matter what.  What does that mean?  It means that training must be comprised of broad and inclusive, constantly varied functional movements that are performed at high intensity in order to prepare for the unknown.\n\nThe Navy SEALS are an elite branch of the U.S. Special Forces whose reputation for outstanding physical fitness is unparalleled. Now everybody that wants to improve his or her health, strength and endurance can take advantage of this information.\n\nTopics Include:\n* Overview of physical fitness \n* Exercise physiology \n* Muscle structure and Function \n* Principles of physical training \n* Specificity of training\n* Determining your training heart rate\n* Energy systems used by exercising muscle\n* Lactic acid and ATP-CP system for anaerobic work\n* Methods of physical training\n* Cardiorespiratory conditioning\n* Determination of work rate\n* Active recovery\n* How to estimate your maximal aerobic capacity\n* Types of aerobic activities\n* Basic workouts \n* Running for fitness\n* Swimming for fitness \n* Strength training\n* Flexibility training\n* Calisthenics\n* Plyometrics\n* Sports related injuries\n* Physical fitness and training recommendations\n* Weight lifting techniques\n* Anatomical terms and diagrams\n\nBonus Nutritional Material!\nNavy Operational Fitness and Fueling Series (NOFFS) designed by the Navy for \"best in class\" fitness and nutrition performance.\n\nSpecial Operations Forces Nutrition Guide designed by the military to meet the physical and mental demands imposed by special operations training and missions."

Best 200 iPhone Apps: The Guide for Discriminating Downloaders: (O'Reilly, July 2009)\n\nRated 9/10 by AppCraver! - \"BreathPacer is a great app for anyone looking to relax or to get into the habit of breathing better for increased health.\" http://www.appcraver.com/breathpacer/\n\nFeatured in Men's Journal magazine issue on optimal performance: http://www.mensjournal.com/breathing\n\nBreathPacer is a powerful breathing guide that can help you reduce stress and experience deep relaxation. Andrew Weil, a leader in the integrative health field, states, “If I had to limit my advice on healthier living to just one tip, it would be simply to learn how to breathe correctly.” \n\nResearch has shown that practicing therapeutic breathing creates profound mental and physiological changes in the body.. Breathpacer is especially useful for those people who want to master the breathing techniques used in various forms of Yoga, Meditation, Qigong and other practices. Use BreathPacer for 10-20 minutes a day and see why therapeutic breathing has been shown to be a treatment and/or adjunctive treatment for depression, anxiety, asthma, COPD, hypertension and has also been found to improve cognitive functioning and sports performance! \n\nPracticing slow breathing is not as easy as it seems. BreathPacer helps you practice proper therapeutic breathing with the following features:  \n\n- Smoothly animated visual breathing cues.\n- Soothing rain sounds direct your in and exhales.\n- Flexibility in choosing your own inhale, exhale and hold pace.\n- Individualized therapeutic breathing algorithm based on your height.\n- Option to gradually reduce your breathing rate over the course of a session to your target therapeutic rate.\n- The ability to play your own music while using the program.\n- NEW: Breathing Timer. Set how long you want to breath for and the program will stop at the appropriate time.\n\nWARNING: If you have a medical condition which makes it difficult to breathe slowly, have difficulty breathing slowly or hyperventilate easily, consult your physician before purchasing BreathPacer. BreathPacer is a guide. It is not a medical device. The user is responsible for determining whether BreathPacer is right for them. Improper slow breathing can cause temporary dizziness or lightheadedness. If you feel any discomfort, stop using BreathPacer immediately. The company holds no fiscal responsibly for people who do not follow the instructions of BreathPacer."

      "label": "Join the hundreds of thousands of runners who have used Run 5k to go from a couch potato to a 5k (3.1 miles) runner. This app is great for beginner runners who have never run before or former runners who want to start up again. \n\nThe Run 5k app has been featured on CNN.com, Boston.com’s lifestyle-health section, and in Health Magazine. Get into shape using our 8-week beginner training plan, complete with an animated warmup and cooldown stretching program. This app has voice cues that guide you even when your screen is locked. The app tells you when to run and walk and gives audio cues for distance and pace when you use GPS. You can use this app outside, on a track, or in the gym.\n\nFEATURES\n• Apple Watch app—you can leave your phone at home while you work out with our Watch app, or continue to use our Watch app together with the iPhone app.\n• Speaks pace, distance, intervals, and halfway point. \n• Optionally uses GPS for pace and distance. (You can also use this app on a treadmill or indoor track without GPS.)\n• Animated warmup and cooldown stretching programs with timer and voice cues.\n• Tap out your heart rate on the heart icon.  \n• Supports Bluetooth heart rate monitors.\n• Integrates with the Health app. Set your weight in the Health app to calculate Calories burned, and to save your Active Calories for each workout.\n\nABOUT the WORKOUTS\n• 8-week training program perfect for beginners or former runners.\n• Each workout is about 30 minutes long.\n• Interval training alternates between jogging and walking.\n• Workout intervals gradually become more challenging.\n• 5-minute warmup and 5-minute cooldown, which are skippable.\n• Speaks each jog and walk interval, halfway mark, and 1-minute-left mark.\n• Optionally speaks pace and distance information every 1/2 mile or 1/2 km.\n• Automatically checks off each completed workout and records your date, pace and distance. \n\nAUDIO CUES and NOTIFICATIONS\nIf you’re not getting Notifications in the background, open the Settings app, select Notifications, then scroll down to find Run 5k in the list. Tap on Run 5k and turn on Notification Center, choose an alert style, and turn everything else on (Sound, Badge App Icon, Lock Screen). Check your volume and make sure your ringer switch is not set to silent/vibrate.\n\nHEALTH\nThis app can be integrated with the Health app. Your weight set in the Health app can be used to calculate Calories burned during a workout, and the total Active Calories burned can be saved to Health app after each workout. Sharing this information with the Health app is optional.\n\nGPS and LOCATION\nTo show distance and pace information, Run 10k can use GPS location tracking during a workout. For best results, use this app outside where you can see open sky. Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nLegal Disclaimer: This app and any information given by it or by Felt Tip Inc are for educational purposes only. They are not intended nor implied to be a substitute for professional medical advice.

For long-term health it is recommended that we take approx. 10,000 steps a day. For successful weight loss, daily steps should amount to 12,000-15,000.\n\nTo get started using iSteps, set up your personal profile by entering your height in cm or inches, your weight in lbs or kg, and choose how you want your results displayed, either in kcal or kJ and distance in miles or km. Then press the START button and you are ready to GO! \n\nWe recommend that you wear your iPhone or iPod touch by your waist or in your pocket, but you may need to experiment a bit to find the best location for optimal accuracy. \n\nPlease note: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. With the option to turn off “Daily Totals Tracking”, you can save battery when needed."

      "label": "Are you trying to quit smoking? If you are finding it hard to stop smoking, QuitNow is made for you.\r\n\r\nFirst things first: you know smoking is bad for your body. Even so, lots of people keep smoking. So why should you quit? When you quit smoking, you improve the quality and length of your life and the lives of the people around you. One way to prepare to successfully launch your smoke-free life is to power up your phone with QuitNow.\r\n\r\nQuitNow is a proven app that engages you to quit smoking. It aims to avoid tobacco just by giving you a picture of yourself. Quitting smoking is easier when you focus your effort on these four sections:\r\n\r\n- Your ex-smoker status: When you quit smoking, the focus has to be on you. Remember the day you quitted and get the maths: how many days are you free of smoke, how much money you saved, and how many cigarettes you avoided.\r\n\r\n- Achievements: your quit smoking motivations: As with all tasks in life, quitting smoking is easier when you divide the task into small and easy ones. So, QuitNow offers you 70 goals based on the cigarettes you avoided, the days since your last cigarette, and the money saved. So, you will start celebrating achievements from the first day.\r\n\r\n- Community: the ex-smokers chat: When you quit smoking, you need to stay within the non-smoking areas. QuitNow offers a chat full of people that, like you, said goodbye to tobacco. Spending time with nonsmokers will make your way easier.\r\n\r\n- Your ex-smoker health: QuitNow offers a list of health indicators to explain how your body improves day by day. They are based in the World Health Organization ones, and we update them as soon as the W.H.O. does.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition, there are more sections in the preferences screen that could help you in your way to quitting smoking.\r\n\r\n- Frequent Asked Questions: there are some tips to quit smoking, and honestly, we don’t know where to put them. Most quitters look for tips on the internet, and there are lots of fake tips there. We researched in the World Health Organization archives to find the investigations they made and the conclusions they had. In the Frequent Asked Questions, you will find all the answers to those questions you have about quitting smoking.\r\n\r\n- The QuitNow bot: sometimes, you have strange questions that don’t appear in the F.A.Q. In those cases, you can ask the bot: we train her to answer those strange ones. If she doesn’t have a good answer, she will contact the QuitNow crew and they will update their knowledge base, so she will learn the best answers to your questions. By the way, yes: all the bot answers are extracted from the W.H.O. archives, as the F.A.Q. tips.\r\n\r\n- Books to quit smoking: knowing some techniques about quitting smoking makes the task easier. There's always someone talking about books in the chat, so we made an investigation to know which are the most popular, and which ones can actually help you to quit smoking for good.\r\n\r\n\r\nDo you have any idea to make QuitNow even better? If so, please do write to us at ios@fewlaps.com\r\n\r\nTerms of Service: https://tos.quitnow.app/eula\r\nPrivacy Policy: https://tos.quitnow.app/privacypolicy"

BeatBurn Elliptical is the first Elliptical Trainer in the App Store, combining lolo's exclusive beat-sync technology with expert guidance from a personal trainer to put a whole new spin on your workout.\n\nbeat-sync analyzes the BPM (Beats Per Minute) of your music, selects the best songs from your iPod playlist to fit the intensity of your workout, then changes the beat on the fly, perfectly matching your pace.\n\n Why does this matter? How does it help you? Research shows that music distracts the brain during exercise and faster music causes people to accept and even prefer a greater degree of effort. This means:\n\n • You will work harder without trying (or without even feeling the difference), \n\n• You will get better results from the increased effort, \n\n• And most importantly, the time will fly by.\n\nFEATURES\n • beat-sync shifts the tempo of your music to match your pace.\n\n • Includes 24 tracks of high-energy music (2-CDs worth)! \n\n • A real voice guides and motivates you through your workouts – not a scary computer voice. \n\n• Fill out your profile and BeatBurn designs the perfect program. \n\n• Your program progresses, every day is a new challenge.\n\n• Set your pace by RPM or Strides per Minute. If your machine doesn't display either, don't worry, the beat of the music will set your pace for you. \n\n• Adjust your workout at anytime using the interactive graph. \n\n• Track your history and share your progress on Facebook or Twitter.\n\n• Retina Display support.\n\n• Bluetooth audio compatible.\n\n• Sync your workouts to the Health app.\n\n• Compatible with most bluetooth heart rate monitors.\n\nBEAT-SYNC\nThere's nothing quite like the feeling of moving to the beat of your favorite song. That Saturday Night Fever strut? (YouTube it, kids) We wanted to have that feeling during every workout, so we built BeatBurn to dynamically change the beat of YOUR music to perfectly match your pace. Trust us, your workouts will feel easier even though you're actually working harder and burning more calories.  \n\nSMART PLAYLIST\nBeatBurn continuously analyzes your workout and picks the best songs to drive you through a great workout.\n\nINTERACTIVE PERSONAL TRAINER\nBeatBurn features an interactive personal trainer whose voice guides you through each workout, giving you the tips you need to get the most out of your workout and the motivation to keep going no matter how tough it gets. BeatBurn gives you complete control as you move through your workout. Turn the intensity down a bit when you're struggling or crank it up when you're ready for more, and your trainer adjusts your workout - and your music - on the fly.\n\nDESIGNED AROUND YOU\nWhether you're a beginner or an athlete, BeatBurn will design the perfect program to match your schedule and fitness level.  \n\nCHALLENGING\nBeatBurn workouts change up the intensity frequently to keep it fun and exciting and most importantly, to challenge your body. Each program uses a combination of intervals and pyramid training to mix up the intensity.\n\n  TRACKING\nBeatBurn keeps track of your intensity and calories burned, so you always know if you're on track to hit your personal fitness goal.\n\nSOCIAL SHARING\nYour personal network is key to reaching your goals. Share your successes with them through Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, or Email.\n\nWorks with Health\n- Completed workouts sync to the Health app, including distance, calories burned and duration."

      "label": "Audio quality. That is what separates Thundergod from all the others. While many have tried to imitate our work, none have achieved the sonic supremacy of the Naturespace thunderstorm series Thundergod. The experience under headphones is unmatched. Our unique 3D recording techniques not only recreate the sound of real storms, but also the detailed spatial characteristics of their unique environments. Follow the trajectories of hundreds of individual rumbles and strikes above you. Feel the rain on the leaves and in the water as wind pushes through the trees. Get lost aboard a giant wooden vessel as she navigates the squall. Thundergod faithfully recreates the variety of storms that have been witnessed through all of history, striking fear and awe into the heart of mankind across the ages.\n\nCompletely remastered, these storms are now much longer and stronger and are accompanied by a beautiful new UI with synchronized, full screen lightning flashes. Thundergod puts the combined power of 6 years of storm recordings in your pocket.\n\nUnlike music, which can be distracting, listening to our storms while working or relaxing gives your mind the space to think and focus by immersing you into amazingly real 3D spaces with intricate and detailed storms that are so long that they never feel repetitive. Six storms are ordered by degree of intensity: the combative and aggressive Thor, the all-night rumbler Odin, the adventurous and fascinating journey of Aegir, and the magical and mystical forest of Loki, as well as two rain-only tracks that are perfect for a sleeping ambience. Thundergod contains an album's worth of audio, but it actually feels much longer due to the seamless and infinite looping that Naturespace is known for. Providing both entertainment and function, Thundergod is the Swiss army knife of thunderstorm apps. It's the one app you will keep coming back to because, in the end, it's all about the audio quality."

Then Get Running with the best Couch to 5k App!\n\nWith three enjoyable workouts a week, in nine weeks you will be running continuously for half an hour, even if getting off the couch is a struggle today!\n\nGet Running breaks through the “beginning barrier” with its enormously popular Couch to 5k running plan. In week one’s workouts you'll alternate one minute of running with 90 seconds of walking. With each new week, Get Running’s human voice coach gradually builds up your pace, until you’re running for a whole half-hour!\n\nGet Running is the only Couch to 5K App that:\n\n• Coaches like a human – with hundreds of studio-recorded progress and encouragement prompts.\n• Supports and encourages you – talk with fellow running rookies on the Get Running forum.\n• Lets you share (NEW!) – share Get Running with up to three other runners: you all get your own log and settings!\n• Helps you plan – rest days help you recover, and Get Running knows the best day for your next run.\n• Displays your next move – the unique Run Clock, customised for each workout, gives complete visibility and understanding.\n\nIn addition, Get Running:\n\n• Works with or without music. Or listen to podcasts and audio books.\n• Fits your schedule – just three workouts a week of 20 to 30 minutes.\n• Logs your achievements – with an illuminating visual record of your progress.\n\nThousands of people have changed their lives with Get Running and you will too! Whether you’re running for your health, training for a 5K, or building to conquer a marathon — Get Running!\n\nGet Running's users say:\n\n• Just finished week 9 run 3 and all I can say is this app changed my life. Great job.\n\n• I LOVE your app. I have tried several but Yours is the BEST for me. I am 60 years young this year & a cancer survivor. I have set the goal to run 5 K races. I use your program as my trainer, it is SUPER. Thank You. – Vickie Wheeler by email\n\n• I tried the top selling \"Couch to 5k\" App before I purchased this one, and this one is much nicer to use. The voice reminders are very helpful. I like how it pauses your music instead of talking over it. I highly recommend it over the others.\n\n• Thank you so much for this little gem of an app. I had a look at others like it but this wins hands down. It is so brilliantly simple with a great interface.\n\n• Thank you! This app has changed my life. I was unfit and didn't do any regular exercise. I always blamed my asthma for being the reason I couldn't run for longer than a minute, but now I know it's because I was unfit! I have signed up for a 5k race too! – @amyriddett on Twitter\n\n• Really great app. I'm actually looking forward to running. I listen to podcasts and this app is terrific at pausing the show to make it's announcements. I don't miss anything that was said. Outstanding."

B.iCycle is known for its stylish user interface combined with maximum ease of use. A new experience on the bike that is a real game changer!\n\n\n— MAXIMUM PRECISION - BIKE LIKE A PRO —\n\nBased on countless test drives and refinement we calculate speed, distance, altitude and calories with maximum precision of the built in GPS. No calibration needed! Units can be set to US or metric. GPS auto pause detection stops the timer for you during a standstill (e.g. when stopping at a traffic light).\n\n\n— ALWAYS AVAILABLE - NEVER LOSE ANY TRIP DATA —\n\nOur multi tasking support allows using the iPod player, texting or calling while recording a trip.\nB.iCycle is 100% compatible from iPhone 4 to iPhone 6+ and works with iOS 7 and iOS8.\nVery power efficient for up to 6 hours of recording with the display turned off.\n\n\n— THE BEST MAPS - TAILOR MADE FOR BIKERS —\n\nThe only biking app that provides the amazing map source OpenCycleMap with highlighted bike paths and contour lines.\nA community of more than 500.000 OpenStreetMap users are mapping roads and bike trails for you! OpenStreetMap constantly collects all bike lanes and trails around the world and is getting better each day!\nWatch your bike automatically move on the map while you bike and zoom in on your current (red line) or saved (blue line) trails.\nB.iCycle stores map data that has been loaded once. That saves battery on the ride and allows you to preload the map when you are biking in an area with no cellular connection or abroad. \n\n\n— IMPORT TRIPS AND SHARE YOURS WITH FRIENDS —\n\nAll trips will be stored and can be shared right after a trip or anytime later from the track history.\nShare your trips via email (KML and GPX e.g. to  watch a trip with Google Earth), Facebook, Twitter and 1-2-sports with other bikers.\nImport trips from the internet for free via the sports portal 1-2-sports.\n\n— FREE UPDATES - FOREVER —\n\nWe update our roadmap constantly based on the best feedback and most frequent requests from our huge community.\nWe have amazing new stuff in the pipeline and all future updates will be 100% free!\n\nB.iCycle - BIKING WILL NEVER BE THE SAME AGAIN!\n\n* For the full experience we recommend to use a bike mount. We love the solutions from Wicked Chili and Dahon. Check www.b-icycle.com for more information.\n\n* Please note: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

Import GPX files.\n\nRunner's Log makes it easy to record the results of a running session in a matter of seconds. You can also use Runner's Log to review your running history, and plan new routes for future running sessions.\n\nYou can simply use GPS if using an iPhone or, when you return from a run, use Runner's Log to record your session: The date, route, and shoes used are all automatically filled in based on defaults. The time spent on your last run for the route is also presented as the default. Simply adjust the minutes or seconds and you are done! Your pace will be shown to you.\n\nTo plan a new route to try in your neighborhood, go to the routes tab and bring up the map, which centers on your current location. Simply tap points on the map in order to create your route. When done, the route distance is automatically computed. If you run this route frequently, you can set it as the default.\n\nRunner's Log makes it a cinch to keep track of shoe mileage. Any unlogged mileage already on your shoes can be added to the total tracked. You can track each pair separately, and you can choose a pair of shoes to be the default for new running sessions. When a pair is ready to be retired, you can mark it as such.\n\nYou can view a calendar showing which days you ran recently. This makes it easy to decide if you are due for a run today, or should take a break. You can also view statistics and charts showing weekly, monthly, and yearly summaries of your distance, time and pace, as well as the accumulated mileage put on your shoes. You can focus on runs of a particular type by filtering by tags.\n\n“Runner’s Log is a fantastic application for keeping track of your runs.” —⁠makeuseof.com\n\n“Aesthetically, Runner's Log is really nice.

If the CNS Tap Test result is elevated it is suitable for a  maximum effort or a heavy lifting day. If the CNS Tap Test result is lower than average it may indicate CNS fatigue and impending sickness, injury or over-training.\n\nBoth hands should be tested on a regular basis in a consistent environment, typically every morning on waking. The procedure for testing is:\n\n - Rest hand palm down on the heel of the hand on a flat surface\n - Tapping is done with the index (pointing finger), and all other fingers remain on the flat surface\n - The timer starts with the first tap\n - When the timer expires no further taps will be accepted\n - The result can either be saved or discarded.\n\nMultiple samples can be saved per day.\n\nThe resulting data can be graphed, emailed or managed from within CNS Tap Test.\n\nUsing Swift Charts for improved accessibility and legibility."

      "label": "BeatBurn uses lolo's exclusive BEAT-SYNC technology, changing the beat of your music to perfectly match your pace! \n\nACCOLADES\n• Featured in Apple Stores on iPhone and iPod Touch display units\n• Featured by Apple as a Fitness Essential\n• Featured by Self Magazine\n• Featured by Fox News\n• Featured by U.S. News & World Report\n\nNo one else combines the expert guidance from a personal trainer in your ear with your favorite songs at the exact pace you need. This is why BeatBurn was featured by Apple in the US iTunes Store and in dozens of iTunes Stores around the world.\n\nBEAT-SYNC analyzes the BPM (Beats Per Minute) of your music, selects the best songs from your iPod playlist to fit the intensity of your workout, then changes the beat on the fly, perfectly matching the pace of your feet on the treadmill or road. \n\n• You will work harder without trying (or without even feeling the difference),\n• You will get better results from the increased effort,\n• And most importantly, the time will fly by!\n\nREAL RESULTS! \n\"Your apps have helped me lose almost 70 pounds. Thanks so much!\" —Joe\n\n“I use my lolo apps for the treadmill and elliptical EVERY day..one or the other....or BOTH!! I am a fanatic! They helped me lose 55 lbs!!” —Wendy\n\n“384lbs to 209lbs...Yes, an entire person (or more) worth of weight.” —Jim \n\n“Started at 241. Now at 205!!!! If I can do it with lolo burn so can others.” —Tom \n\n\"This is the best app I have on my phone. I use it daily and lost 50 pounds last year in 6 months. Excellent.\" —ChasMsnia\n\nFEATURES\n• BEAT-SYNC shifts the tempo of your music to perfectly match the pace of your feet.\n• Includes 24 tracks of high-energy music (2-CDs worth)!  \n• Use it on a treadmill or take it outside. Walk, walk-jog or run. \n• A real voice guides and motivates you through your workouts – not a scary computer voice. \n• Fill out your profile and BeatBurn designs the perfect program. \n• Your program progresses, every day is a new challenge. \n• Adjust your workout at anytime using the interactive graph. \n• Sync your workouts to the Health app.\n• Compatible with most bluetooth heart rate monitors.\n• Track your history and share your progress on Facebook or Twitter.  \n\nBEAT-SYNC \nThere's nothing quite like the feeling of moving to the beat of your favorite song. That Saturday Night Fever strut? (YouTube it, kids) We wanted to have that feeling during every workout, so we built BeatBurn to dynamically change the beat of YOUR music to perfectly match your pace. Trust us, your workouts will feel easier even though you're actually working harder and burning more calories.  \n\nINTERACTIVE PERSONAL TRAINER \nBeatBurn features an interactive personal trainer whose voice guides you through each workout, giving you the tips you need to get the most out of your workout and the motivation to keep going no matter how tough it gets. BeatBurn gives you complete control as you move through your workout. Turn the intensity down a bit when you're struggling or crank it up when you're ready for more, and your trainer adjusts your workout - and your music - on the fly.\n\nDESIGNED AROUND YOU \nWhether you're a beginner or an athlete, BeatBurn will design the perfect program to match your schedule and fitness level.  \n\nCHALLENGING \nBeatBurn workouts change up the intensity frequently to keep it fun and exciting and most importantly, to challenge your body. Each program uses a combination of intervals and pyramid training to mix up the intensity.  \n\nTRACKING \nIndoors or outdoors, BeatBurn keeps track of your speed and calories burned, so you always know if you're on track to hit your personal fitness goal.\n\nMULTITASKING \nBeatBurn runs perfectly in the background on supported devices.\n\nWorks with Health\n- Completed workouts sync to the Health app, including distance, calories burned and duration."

The perfect iPhone app for running, cycling, hiking, walking or simply tracking where you go.\n\n.........................................................................\n\n\" I swore by CycleTracker until I found this. That's not to disparage CycleTracker at all, which still does the job nicely. But Kinetic is by far simpler, cleaner, more intuitive, and has all the same features in a much easier to use design. It also syncs with Daily Mile, which is likewise a much smarter and simpler fitness tracker than CycleTracker has with Training Peaks. \" - Customer review by JDob\n\n.........................................................................\n\nJust tap Start\nKinetic records everything for you: Time, distance, speed, pace, altitude (Google assisted), calories burned, heading, compass, live mapping and more.\n\nRoll your own Kinetic\nKinetic's unique modules allow you to build your own app. Out-of-the-box Kinetic is ready to go but you can also add as many different modules as you want, arrange them in any order and change the settings to your heart's content. You can even change the app style to suite your outfit. The possibilities are endless.\n\nLog-book\nAll your workout data is automatically saved into a comprehensive training history. You can review and share (or show-off!) your best runs with family and friends: Dailymile, Facebook, Twitter and Email.\n\nSharing\nYou can review and share (show-off!) your best runs with family and friends: Dailymile, Facebook, Twitter, Email and now Runkeeper!\n\nPersonal trainer\nKinetic comes included with running training plans: 5k, 10k, half-marathon, for all levels. Developed by a former London Marathon winner, Kinetic’s training plans harness the expertise of some of the UK's most experienced runners and coaches. More training plans to come.\n\nChallenge yourself\nSet and measure your own personal targets and track your achievements as you progress through your goals. Kinetic will keep you informed on your progress.\n\nDon't miss a beat\nMonitor your heart rate in real-time. Plug-in your Wahoo Fitness key and wear your ANT+ rate monitor. Displays current, average and target range.\n\nA word in your ear\nGet audio feedback as you workout, when and how you want it. Listen to music as you train, in-flight iPod controls included.\n\nReady, Steady, Wait!…\nRemember to warm-up first. Use the countdown timer for a delayed start to set your own custom warm-up times.\n\nRed lights!\nAs hard as we tried we could not make the traffic lights change green for you. But we did the next best thing and added Auto pause. Perfect for cyclists or urban-runners.\n\nNot just running\nChoose from a range of Activities or add your own, and create and edit your own personal outdoor sessions. No sweat, use Kinetic just for fun. keep track of you go.\n\n.........................................................................\n\nStill not sure, try Kinetic GPS Lite for free.\n\n.........................................................................\n\nREQUIREMENTS: Kinetic App is compatible with iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4 running iOS 6.0 or later. Some features such as sharing, Google assisted altitude data require a wireless network for full functionality. Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

      "label": "This professional tool called Clinometer is the most precise (all you can get with some calculations) slope measurement tool for the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad using all sides of the device plus the camera. It can be used for simple applications like aligning a frame as well as for more sophisticated fields of applications where an arbitrary slope needs to be measured exactly. Read the reviews (and write your own) for all the applications you find! Thank for all your positive feedback! Please use our support link if you have questions and suggestions, we don't read the iTunes reviews every day!\n\nWith this tool, the slope can be measured by all edges of the device and through the camera. The current features include:\n\n◆ 3 Modes (incl. auto switching): Clinometer mode (auto when holding upright), Camera mode (any direction, manual activation) and Bubble level (smoothly fading in when holding flat).\n\n◆ Relative angles: Besides measuring absolute angles, for every mode you can measure the relative angle between device positions\n\n◆ Advanced two way calibration on all sides: For every 4 sides plus the bubble mode you can calibrate in two steps, which allows you to calibrate exactly even on non-level surfaces. Each direction can be calibrated individually to achieve the optimal precision. \n\n◆ Speech synthesis: The device will speak the current reading, so you don't have to watch the display while measuring/aligning your object.\n\n◆ Five different unit modes: The device can display the slope in degrees (rounded or in tenth of degrees), percentage, rise over run (common for roof slope measurement in :12) and 1V:H (common in engineering)\n\n◆ Dial Rotation: You can smoothly rotate the background dial and thus define which side of the device represents 0° and 90° degrees. \n\n◆ Motion-sensitive Lock feature: Besides the common instant simple tap hold mechanism you can activate the motion-sensitive lock. If activated the device waits for the final lock until you hold your device steady enough for at least 2 seconds. You can set the lock sensitivity between 0.1° and 1.0° degrees. \n\n◆ Peer Mode: Use two devices to measure angles: One as a display, the other as the measurement device that can be attached to the hardware you want to align. \n\n◆ Fullscreen Mode: The full screen mode can be toggled by tapping the center of the screen and by the upper and lower arrows in the center. This prevents you from erroneous inputs while measuring.\n\n◆ Different color schemes: Press the S/C Button to instantly switch the color. The color can be selected differently for the bubble and the clinometer mode. The predefined color sets include day and night color schemes (Black on White, White on Black and Red). \n\n◆ Adjustable Auto-Lock: You can prevent the device from turning into the sleep mode. \n\nAccording to wikipedia: An inclinometer or clinometer is an instrument for measuring angles of slope (or tilt), elevation or inclination of an object with respect to gravity. It is also known as a tilt meter, tilt indicator, slope alert, slope gauge, gradient meter, gradiometer, level gauge, level meter, declinometer, and pitch & roll indicator. \n\nFor recreational use only. After the calibration it CAN (!) be very accurate especially for the main axis after calibration. The measurement is performed as well as possible (we try our best) by using the three inbuilt accelerometers. \n\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT! \n\nWe will improve the application long-term. This was the first application of this kind shortly after the opening of the App Store. Since then it is continuously updated and enriched with new features."

      "label": "Rowmote lets you seamlessly control audio, video, and presentation applications on your Mac from your iOS device.\n\nYou love the remote control which came with your Mac - so simple yet elegant, with easy control of Front Row, iTunes, Quicktime, DVD Player, Keynote, and more.\n\nOr, your Mac didn’t come with a remote control or doesn’t even have an infrared port. Buying a remote control, from Apple or a third party, would carry a significant cost!\n\nYou carry your iPhone or iPod Touch wherever you go... so why should you carry a second device just to control your computer?  Furthermore, why should you need line-of-sight to do so?\n\nEnter Rowmote!  Rowmote is like your Mac’s remote control, but over the wireless network and even better! By tapping the Apps button, you get bonus abilities, switching between controlled programs, toggling the iTunes Visualizer, and more. Rowmote will even wake sleeping Macs.\n\nFEATURES\n\n - Control your Mac over a wireless network. No line of sight necessary.\n\n - Functions just like the hardware Apple Remote Control in:\n• Adobe Lightroom\n• Airfoil Video\n• Amarra\n• Aperture\n• BBC iPlayer\n• Beamer\n• Boxee\n• Decibel\n• DVD Player\n• Ecoute\n• eyeTV 3.x\n• Firefox\n• Front Row\n• Hulu Desktop\n• iPhoto\n• iTunes\n• Keynote ‘08 & later\n• kJams Pro\n• Kodi\n• Last.fm\n• Logic\n• Microsoft Powerpoint ‘04 & later\n• mPlayer\n• Movist\n• OpenOffice Impress\n• Preview\n• PandoraBoy\n• PandoraJam\n• PandoraOne Desktop\n• Photos\n• Plex, Plex Home Theater, & Plex Media Player\n• Quicktime\n• Rdio\n• Safari\n• Skim\n• Songbird\n• Spotify\n• Squire\n• The Tube\n• VLC\n• xbmc (Xbox Media Center)\n\n- SWITCH: Access your Mac’s Dock, launching & switch between all controllable applications on the Mac, toggle the iTunes visualizer, and more. Order & display customizable.\n\n - Click-and-hold works just like on the physical remote in applications; for example, holding the right button fast-forwards, while a single click is ‘next’. This is a feature no other iPhone remote control I know of does properly!\n\n- Sleep on demand; wake the Mac automatically\n- Pause the music or video automatically when you answer a call on your iPhone\n- Proximity sensor support to automatically turn the screen off if the device is face-down\n- Secure authentication\n- Optional dark interface\n- Connect via WiFi or Bluetooth (Bluetooth requires Personal Hotspot Bluetooth tethering)\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n\n • Mac OS X 10.4.0 or later.\n • Mac: The free Rowmote Helper program must be running on the Mac to be controlled. Download at www.rowmote.com. Some features require later versions of Mac OS X.\n\nRowmote is a steal! Couple it with Apple’s free Remote app to turn your iPhone or iPod Touch into the ultimate controller for home stereo, mobile presentation, or casual video viewing.\n\nThe artwork of Rowmote was designed by Rik Schennink."

See the ratings and reviews for yourself. \n\nOther apps simply blow up the video preview without active stabilization resulting in terrible picture quality. Binoculars actually processes the full resolution photo sensor as fast as possible and then crops in on that full resolution photo image resulting in a much higher quality enlargement and a much more useful image. \n\nWhy pack binoculars when they can now be a part of your phone? Zoom in up to 32x (on latest iOS devices with Telephoto Lens) and up to 16x on older devices. For a closer look at nature, sporting events, or someone in the distance use our digital binoculars for high-resolution photo or video while in extreme zoom mode.\n\nFrom i4software, creators of Vizzywig, Flashlight and Fast Camera!\n\n• Binoculars incorporates GPS technology and displays your location on the map, shows your latitude and longitude coordinates, and remembers the exact location of your pictures. \n\n• Binoculars’ simple user-interface makes it fast and easy to use for all ages.\n\n• Includes Google Cardboard mode in landscape orientation."

      "label": "With SatFinder you can adjust your satellite antenna in a few seconds and with 4 simple steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - CHOOSE YOUR ANTENNA\nChoose one of the four different antenna designs: \n - Offset antennas (the most common, is slightly oval, the LNB is not in the center).\n - Special design (e.g. Oblong shaped Offset antenna, Multifeed antenna)  \n - Parabolic antenna (LNB is located in the center of the reflector, usually larger than 100cm)\n - Flat or planar antenna (small, camping antennas)\n\nIf you have an offset antenna, enter the height and width of the antenna. If your antenna has a special shape, enter the offset angle and the size of the satellite antenna. You can find the offset angle in the manual of your satellite antenna. For parabolic antennas it is sufficient to enter the antenna diameter. With a flat antenna you do not have to set anything. If you know the exact antenna name, check if your antenna is already in the database.\n\nTip: Press the wizard button to measure the size of the satellite antenna using the iPhone camera and LiDAR scanner. \n\nSTEP 2 - CHOOSE YOUR SATELLITE\nTo quickly and easily select a suitable satellite, simply press the \"AUTO\" button. The SatFinder will now automatically search for satellites that are in your reception area and that offer TV or radio stations in your language (the language setting of your iPhone will be selected). The stars (1-10) shown in the table result from the number of radio and TV channels offered and the reception strength at your location.  \n\nIf you want to receive a special satellite, switch off \"AUTO\": Now you can simply scroll through the table and select the satellite. Faster is the search function - just enter the name of the satellite, the channel or the orbit position. You can also reduce the number of table entries by hiding satellites that are not available at your location or do not broadcast in your language. With the button \"Channel Info\" you can check which channels the selected satellite is currently broadcasting - including all channel parameters for your satellite receiver.  \n\nSTEP 3 - CHECK OBSTACLES\nFor a smooth satellite reception, there must not be any obstacles between the satellite and your satellite antenna. You can check this with the \"View\" function. Simply aim at the satellite and watch the signs (GREEN - no obstacle, RED - caution, free view may not be given).\n\nTip: Press the button for the assistant to activate the voice output.\n\nSTEP 4 - ADJUST ANTENNA\nIn the menu item \"Align\" different graphics appear depending on the selected antenna type. If you use an offset antenna, you have to adjust the azimuth and elevation separately. With planar or parabolic antennas the adjustment of the angles is done together. Before you press the \"Start\" button, a video clip shows how to position your iPhone at the antenna. \n\nTip: Press the button for the assistant to activate the voice output.\n\nSTEP 5 - FINE TUNING \nIf necessary, you can optimize the reception of your satellite system. The SatFinder provides you with the function \"FineTuning\". To use this function, you need a second iOS device. One device serves as a camera; the second device as a monitor. Simply place an iPhone in front of your reception screen and observe changes in picture quality while slightly rotating or tilting your satellite antenna. With the FineTuning feature, you'll have visual contact with your TV even when you're out of sight. \n\nTHAT'S IT. YOU SHOULD NOW BE ABLE TO ENJOY INTERFERENCE-FREE SATELLITE RECEPTION... \nNote: Satellite antenna tuning is only available on iOS devices with LiDAR sensor (e.g. iPhone 12 Pro)."

      "label": "=================================== \n   Keep your private life private™ \n=================================== \n\nFINALLY!! At long last, iDiscrete 3.0 is ready for download. This new version is fully functional on all new iPhones and the latest version of iOS. It is now optimized for the larger screen sizes of the newest iOS devices. We are still ironing out some small bugs, but we're 95% of the way there...\nThanks for supporting our pet project iDiscrete. We will continue updating the app as long as there are still users out there that are enthusiastic about it. THANK YOU!!\n\niDiscrete has a very simple Mission Statement: \n\n\"To securely store our user's private content (videos, images, notes, et al.) on their iOS devices, and to do so in the most discreet way possible.\" \n\nYou can think of iDiscrete as a digital safe, where you can securely store all your private pictures, videos, notes and more. Rather than requiring a suspicious looking password or PIN to enter the app, iDiscrete uses its patented Touch Sequence Protection™. This works by bringing up a fake \"Loading\" screen upon entry to the application. An unauthorized user will think the app is really loading, but the device owner knows that this is actually the password screen.  A series of taps in the correct places (the \"Touch Sequence\") will open up the app. Doing nothing will boot to a dummy app. \n\nThis unique feature, combined with an application icon and name that do not give away its functionality, mean that an unauthorized user would NEVER suspect the true nature of the app.\n\nKeep your private life private with iDiscrete!\n\n=================================== \n\niDiscrete distinguishes itself from the competition in a number of important ways: \n\n► PRICE ◄ \niDiscrete is half the price of its nearest legitimate competition. DO YOUR HOMEWORK AND READ OUR REVIEWS, AND YOU WILL FIND THAT iDISCRETE IS BY FAR THE BEST VALUE, NOT TO MENTION A SUPERIOR APP. \n\n► SUPPORTED FILE TYPES ◄ \niDiscrete has a massive list of file formats it supports, and here is it:\nJPG, PNG, BMP, GIF, 3GP, ASF, AVI, DIVX, DV, FLV, GXF, M2P, M2TS, M2V, M4V, MKV, MOOV, MOV, MP4, MPEG, MPEG1, MPEG2, MPEG4, MPG, MPV, MT2S, MTS, MXF, OGM, OGV, PS, QT, RM, RMVB, TS, VOB, WEBM, WM, WMV, TXT, DOC, DOCX, RTF, XLS, XLSX, PPT, PPTX, PDF and MP3. Whew! (And we are adding more all the time…)\n\n► UPDATES ◄ \nWe have a number of future upgrades planned that will add even more functionality to iDiscrete, many of which were taken directly from real end-user suggestions. Other apps do not offer the exceptional customer support and updates that we do. \n\n► WIFI HARD DRIVE ◄ \nUsing our innovative iDiscrete File Manager, you can get your content onto your iOS device using any computer with a web browser and a WiFi connection. In addition, YOU CAN PULL CONTENT OFF THE DEVICE IN THE SAME WAY. iDiscrete allows you to upload any file type (unsupported formats go into a \"Misc.\" folder) so in this way it doubles as a mass storage device. Stand alone apps that do this often cost more than iDiscrete! \n\n► It's right in the name: DISCREET! ◄ \nOther apps simply password protect your content, but to prying eyes this can still look very suspicious. Thus, iDiscrete not only hides the sensitive content and effectively password protects it, but it conceals the very fact that an app with this functionality exists on the user's device. It avoids a situation where an unauthorized user may inadvertently click on the app, see a password, and ask you \"Hey, what's this??\" \n\nIT NEVER LOOKS LIKE YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO HIDE WITH iDISCRETE."

The Apple Remote would cost a significant amount. Add ANOTHER hit to your wallet for a wireless control like a keyboard, mouse, or the Apple Magic Trackpad!\n\nYou carry your iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad wherever you go… so why should you carry a second device just to control your computer? Furthermore, why should you need line-of-sight to do so?\n\nEnter Rowmote Pro! Rowmote Pro is like your Mac’s remote control, but over the wireless network and even better! Trackpad and keyboard give you complete control over your computer, and you can control, launch, and quit apps, toggle the Music Visualizer, and more without ever having to squint at your screen. Rowmote is Mac-like from the ground up.\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Control your Mac completely over a wireless network. No line of sight necessary.\n\n- Works like the hardware Apple Remote Control in:\n• Adobe Lightroom\n• Airfoil Video\n• Amarra\n• Aperture\n• BBC iPlayer\n• Beamer\n• Boxee\n• Decibel\n• DVD Player\n• Ecoute\n• eyeTV 3.x\n• Firefox\n• Front Row\n• Hulu Desktop\n• iPhoto\n• iTunes\n• Keynote ‘08 & later\n• kJams Pro\n• Kodi\n• Last.fm\n• Logic\n• Microsoft Powerpoint ‘04 & later\n• mPlayer\n• Movist\n• Music\n• OpenOffice Impress\n• Preview\n• PandoraBoy\n• PandoraJam\n• PandoraOne Desktop\n• Photos\n• Plex, Plex Home Theater, & Plex Media Player\n• Quicktime\n• Rdio\n• Safari\n• Skim\n• Songbird\n• Spotify\n• Squire\n• The Tube\n• VLC\n• xbmc (Xbox Media Center)\n\nPRO CONTROL: A single tap switches to the keyboard & trackpad mode.\n- True multitouch: Scroll with two fingers, right click, drag, pinch to zoom, and swipe with 3 or 4 fingers.\n- Tap anywhere or use the virtual button\n- Keyboard includes extended characters, modifier keys, function keys, numeric pad, brightness control, and more\n- Multiple monitor support\n\n- SWITCH: Access your Mac’s Dock; launch & switch between all controllable applications on the Mac; toggle the iTunes visualizer; and more.\n\n- Sleep & wake as needed\n- Pause the music or video automatically when you answer a call on your iPhone\n- Proximity sensor support to automatically turn the screen off if the device is face-down\n- Secure authentication\n- Connect via WiFi or Bluetooth (Bluetooth requires Personal Hotspot Bluetooth tethering)\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n\n • The free Rowmote Helper program must be running on the Mac. Download at www.rowmote.com.\n • Apple TV: 1st gen/2nd gen only may see www.rowmote.com/atv for potential compatibility.\n\nRowmote Pro is the only app you need to control your computer.

      "label": "This tool shows you the ultimate precise time of day. To achieve this, it uses a special internet time protocol to fetch the time from an atomic time server.\n\nWe are proud to offer version 5 of the Gorgy Timing Atomic Clock. The program is one of the classic applications since the early days of the Apple App Store and has been continually improved based on user feedback.\n\nThe Gorgy Timing Atomic Clock shows the precise time of day. To achieve this, it uses a special internet time protocol to fetch the ultimate precise time from cesium atomic clocks available on the internet, or any other time server you like.\n\nThe graphical display mimics the clock display of the legendary Gorgy Timing clocks, which are used in professional radio and television studios, and we spent much effort to bring the original feeling of these wickedly expensive clocks to your iPhone. This app is used by BBC studios, astronomers, concert promoters, etc. \n\nVersion 5 contains the following functions:\n\n* Universal support for all iPhone, iPad and iPod touch devices running iOS 8 or higher (including iPhone 11, 11 Pro, 11 Pro Max, and all of the latest iPads and iPads Pro)\n* Optimized for iOS 13 and watchOS 6, full 64 bit support\n* Alarm function with snooze (touch anywhere on the screen), volume fade-in, based on weekdays\n* Alarm time based on seconds (not minutes)\n* Local time / UTC time mode\n* Alarm notification window instead of normal alarm sound, if app is not running or in the background\n* Use playlists or a manual picker selection from your own music library as alarm sounds\n* The alarm sound is also playing when the device is muted, or the display is switched off, and also works in AirPlay environments\n* Customizable time server sources\n* Colors: green, red, blue, yellow, white, dark green, violet, pink, orange, turquoise and hidden, with a separate color option for digits, seconds and segments\n* Alternative visual display of fractional seconds (1/60th sec. resolution)\n* 12/24 hours display\n* Optional second tick sound\n* Full landscape support (including settings dialog)\n* Touching the display lets the buttons and status bar fade out\n* Touching the display again will add the current date (in all orientations)\n* Disabled screen auto-lock\n* Options \"sync at startup\", \"hourly\", \"daily\", or a sync button for manual syncing\n* The last known time delta is used when started without sync\n* \"Night mode\", which dims the display using a slider, shows the seconds with only one dot (to prevent a hard brightness switch between second 59 and second 0), switches off the tick sound, and reduces screen updates to save battery\n* To minimize burn-in effects (especially on the iPhone X OLED display), the clock is doing micro movements when running longer than 5 minutes\n* VoiceOver support\n\nAnswers to common questions:\n\n* An application can not set your device's system time, so a time sync between the atomic time and the device time is not possible.\n* If you want to wakeup with music, please do not exit the app before going to sleep (which would result in a local notification dialog without music in the morning), and do not lock your device. Be aware that running an application all the time, even without display, consumes battery, so please make sure that your iPhone is fully charged before you go to bed, connect it to your charger, or use the app's Night mode, which is much more energy-saving."

      "label": "iCab Mobile is a web browser for the iOS. It provides many unique and useful features you won't find in other iPhone browsers.\n\nAPPLE WATCH:\nThe Watch App is a remote control for iCab Mobile, so you can navigate, zoom, scroll, open bookmarks, links, the homepage, switch tabs or sitch on/off the fullscreen mode. Since watchOS 6.2 you can also open web pages and browse the Web directly on the Apple Watch. But there are still limitations: there are no navigation buttons (back/forward) available.\n\nFILE UPLOADS:\niCab Mobile can upload any files on web pages.\n\nSEARCHING:\niCab Mobile comes with several default search engines you can choose from. You can easily add new search engines. \n\nFILLING OUT FORMS:\niCab Mobile can save web forms and restore the form content later (manually or automatically). The saved forms data can be password protected. Supports many third-party Password Manager Apps as well.\n\nFILTERS:\nThere’s a built-in fully customizable filter feature. It allows to block resources, ads, banners, user tracking scripts, cookies etc. Supports AdBlock Plus/EasyList filters as well.\n\nTABS:\niCab Mobile supports Tabs, so you can open multiple web pages at the same time. Links can be opened in Tabs (in the foreground or background) manually or automatically. \n\nBOOKMARKS:\nBookmarks can be organized in folders. You can import/export the bookmarks from/to your PC/Mac browser. \n\nFULLSCREEN MODE:\niCab Mobile provides a fullscreen mode where the whole screen is used to display the web page. No screen space is wasted for toolbars. \n\nDOWNLOADS:\niCab Mobile has a built-in Download Manager so you can download almost all files from the internet. The downloads can be easily transfered to a Mac/PC/Linux computer but also to other Apps on the device which can open these files\n\nMULTIUSER SUPPORT\nYou can create multiple user accounts, each user has its own private bookmarks, filters, settings, etc.\n\nDROPBOX\niCab Mobile supports Dropbox. Export/Import bookmarks; transfer downloads, images, files, web pages to your Dropbox account.\n\nTWIN BROWSER:\nIn this mode, you can have two browsers side by side on the iPad. This is especially useful on the large iPad Pro.\n\nVOICEOVER\nThe App is also accessible for visually impaired and blind users. If VoiceOver is enabled, the App plays soft ticks while a page is loading, so blind users are able to identify when the page load has finished. \n\nOTHER FEATURE:\n- Configurable multi-touch gestures\n- QuickStarter feature\n- AirPrint support \n- Browser ID (UserAgent) is configurable\n- iCab Mobile fully supports international domain names\n- Cookie Manager\n- Private Browsing (no history and no cookies are stored)\n- Privacy settings allows to delete all kinds of private data (history, cookies, databases, saved forms, passwords etc.)\n- URL autocompletion \n- Simple built-in RSS reader\n- Save images, whole web pages, PDF files\n- Kiosk Mode - a restricted variation of the fullscreen mode for Kiosk environments. \n- History\n- Addressbook support lets you access the web pages from the addressbook. \n- When launching iCab can either open an empty page, the homepage or restore the Tabs which were open the last time\n- There are different color schemes and designs\n- Document Sharing lets you pass downloads and files to other Apps in the device\n\n\n\nThe App includes a store providing several InApp purchases. These are meant as a tip jar. The InApp purchases are available for different prices, so you can pick the amount for the tip yourself. Doing so will unlock a few cool features as a reward, these are always the same, regardless of the amount of the tip. Users who have purchased the App within the last 12 months do get all these features for free, no need to buy one of the InApp purchases. Though they can nevertheless give me a tip, if they want to... ;-)"

We have more updates coming soon!\n\nBluetooth Photo Share Pro does not display any Advertisements.  Other than that is basically the same as the free version right now, except that we are working on new \"pro-only\" features that will be coming soon!  Please support us and buy now!\n\n-------------------------\n\nTransfer photos and/or contacts between two iPhones and/or iPod Touches over bluetooth.  Requires iPhone 3G or later or 2nd generation iPod Touch or later (Bluetooth data transfer cannot be supported on the original iPhone or original iPod Touch due to hardware limitations).  Does not require any 3G or WiFi connection.\n\nThis is the best bluetooth photo sharing app out there!!\n\nHere are some features that make this app stand out:\n- Unlike some other photo sharing apps, Bluetooth Photo Share does not scale down or do any lossy compression of your photos before transferring.  In other words, the receiver gets the exact image that was in the sender's photo library.\n- Allows you to transfer contacts from your address book.\n- The receiver transfer screen includes a thumbnail preview of the photo AS IT IS BEING TRANSFERRED and a cancel button so that you can cancel the transfer if you decide you do not want it.\n- Shows a scrollable list of thumbnails and file sizes for all of the images that you've received.\n- Allows you to view your photo albums that your photos were saved in.\n- Select Multiple Photos\n\nWe are also working on some great new features that we hope you'll really like.  We have a website: http://iphonemart.net.  Also check us out on twitter at http://www.twitter.com/iphonemart\n\n-------------------------\n\nMost of the time, the app works great.  However, when people experience problems, 99% of the time it is related to connecting with bluetooth, which would be the same for any bluetooth App.  If you have any trouble connecting, please check our support webpage for troubleshooting information.\n\nNote that if you are trying to transfer photos from your old phone or to/from your computer, there is no way to do that on the iPhone with bluetooth."

In detailed mode, the text being encoded is scrolling through the decoding process. \n\nTap some morse code onto the screen and the program will translate it into some text. \nDifferent input types are handled : Novice, Straight key, Memory Paddle, Iambic Paddle (A and B), Microphone. Left and right handed modes supported. \nTest and improve your skills : are you good enough to be understood? \n\nCreate audio files containing Morse code in a dynamic way or from a given text.\nUse those files as you wish : listen to them to train your decoding skills or use them as ringtones for your phone.\n\nExclusive feature allowing to decode, in real time, the Morse code recorded from the microphone into Text (the sound must be quite clear/loud and without much noise). \nSome automatic calibration is performed, allowing adaptation to speed, tone and volume changes. \n\nThe full Morse alphabet can also be consulted and the associated Morse code can be played. \nTapped and decoded text can be edited and exported to the clipboard, the In-app email and SMS. \nA special screen allows textual conversion of morse code and text. Exchange encoded messages with your friends. \n\nWikipedia and Visual Mnemonic screens allowing to get informations and mnemonics regarding morse code.\nYou can also add your own web sites for an in-app consultation.\nAll the application is highly configurable (Frequency, WPM, tone type, color, morse characters, variables ...) \n\n!!! As seen on TV !!!

You can also switch the light amplification mode to exposure mode for better quality. With an exposure time of up to one second you will be able to view the smallest details. It's ideal for twilight situations.\n\nThe luminance histogram shows you the brightness level in real-time.\n\nZoom in inconspicuously using the 10x digital Live Zoom - and shoot your photos.\n\nYou've naturally got many different color filters to choose from.\n\nThe most important functions are:\n\n- Three amplification modes\n- Up to 1 second * exposure time\n- Residual light amplification\n- True low light enhancement\n- Real-time luminance histogram\n- Volume Up (+) Photo Capture\n- 10x digital live zoom\n- Tap to focus\n- Color filters: green, red, blue, b/w, sepia, etc.\n- Take HD photos\n- Landscape and portrait modes\n- Supports the front & back cameras\n- Supports LED lights\n- Supports EXIF-data\n\n*) only on supported devices\n\nA good camera and a powerful processor are required, to get the maximum picture quality.\n\nAll the screenshots listed were taken with an iPhone and iPad and are genuine!\n\nPlease note that this app does not provide true night vision functionality. The iPhone, iPad and iPod touch have no infrared amplifier, as a result no pictures can be taken in total darkness; a minimal level of light is still required, which can be ascertained by the camera's sensors. The preview will also be delayed in exposure mode. In addition the camera must be held stable for exposure time.\n\n---------------------------- \n\nFollow us: http://twitter.com/CLIDOapps \nVisit us: http://www.clidoapps.com"

This will help avoid damage to your speakers if the volume is too loud.\n\nNext, if using a cable to connect, plug one end of your audio cable into the 3.5mm headphone output of the iOS device, or Lightning to 3.5mm headphone adapter, then connect the other end of the cable to your audio hardware.\n\nCables are available with many different options to connect to powered speakers, home stereos, audio mixers, etc. Click below to shop for cables.\n\nIf using Bluetooth or AirPlay, tap the AirPlay icon to select your output device. Please note that if you are using AirPlay you will see a significant delay between the microphone and the speaker.\n\nFinally, turn Microphone Pro on by pressing the large On/Off button on the display. Adjust the volume by using the volume slider on the display and/or the volume buttons of your iOS device.\n\nImportant note:\niOS devices use Omnidirectional microphones which can be prone to feedback. Make sure that your device is not in front of any speakers that will be projecting your voice. You can also reduce feedback issues by using the Apple wired headset or purchasing a professional lavalier microphone to use in conjuntfion with Microphone Pro.\n\nUsing the On/Off button:\n* Tapping the On/Off button turns the mic on.\n* Tapping the On/Off button again turns the mic off.\n* When Microphone Pro is off, pressing and holding the On/Off button will turn on the mic until you release the On/Off button. This is known as Push-To-Talk or PTT.\n* When Microphone Pro is on, pressing and holding the On/Off button will mute the mic until you release the On/Off button. This is known as Push-To-Cough (PTC) or Push-To-Mute (PTM)."

      "label": "With Group SMS you can send an SMS text message to a group of contacts. Group SMS is the perfect app to send your Christmas and New Year greetings to your loved ones and friends.\n\nThese groups can be small or very large (Bulk SMS) and send to tens, hundreds or thousands of contacts. You can also send email to groups. Group SMS is ideal when you need to send the same message to any number of contacts.\n\nGroup SMS will show you the groups that are already defined in the Contacts app of your iPhone. It also allows you to create new groups as well as modify your existing groups and contacts.\n\nUsing the built-in Templates feature, you can reuse often-used text messages or emails that you need to send to groups.\n\nYou can also add attachments to your messages, like photos or PDFs.\n\nGroup SMS will send the SMS using the built-in Messages app OR you can use the special SMS gateway of Group SMS.\n\nThe costs of the SMSs will be charged by your mobile operator or you can buy SMS from within the app itself. If a group contains 12 contacts, you will be charged 12 SMS.\n\nWhen you have a very large group (more than 50 contacts), you can choose to bypass your own mobile provider and select to use the SMS gateway of Group SMS instead. This will allow you to send your Group SMS with less cost and with more control. This feature is also ideal for marketing campaigns. You can import a large set of numbers via a .CSV file.\n\nGroup Mail is always without costs. You can also forward email attachments to groups.\n\nFEATURES\n\n√ Text message a group (SMS)\n√ Text message very large groups (Bulk SMS)\n√ Email a group and forward email attachments to groups\n√ Text message to a CSV file of mobile numbers\n√ Text message with attachments (photo, PDF)\n\n√ Create groups\n√ Delete groups\n√ Rename groups\n\n√ Add contact to group\n√ Delete contact from group\n√ Edit contact information\n\n√ Templates\n\n√ Supports your built-in contacts and groups\n√ Supports your iCloud contacts and groups\n\n√ Uses built-in Messages app ór Bulk SMS Gateway\n√ Replies are received in Messages\n\n√ Uses built-in Mail app\n√ Forward attachments of any type\n\n√ Built-in video tutorials\n\nGroup SMS requires iOS 6 or higher and is localized in English, German, French, Italian, Spanish and Dutch.\n\nVideo tutorials are available on the web site (see link below) and in the app itself.\n\nREVIEWS\n\n\"Works Perfectly\" - USA\n\n\"This app does what it says it can, and does it very well.\" - United Kingdom\n\n\"WELTKLASSE.

Therefore, iTopography can calculate the area of any surface, whether this surface is a garden, the living room, a field or even a geometrical shape for a homework class.\n\niTopography uses the GPS device to obtain the longitude and latitude of the current position.  In the case of a weak signal (e.g., inside the house), the user is asked to give the distance and angle between two adjacent points. \n\nIn order for iTopography to compute the area of a surface, the user must move along the borders of the surface in a clockwise or counter-clockwise direction. When the user inserts a point, iTopography will connect the adjacent points with a straight line, draw the surface, and calculate the area of the surface along with its perimeter."

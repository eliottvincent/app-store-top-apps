      "label": "- WHAT IS LOÓNA?\nloóna is the first app that lets you quickly disconnect from a long stressful day and get in the right mood for sleep.\n\n- SO, IT'S ANOTHER SLEEP APP, RIGHT?\n Not exactly. loóna isn’t a list of direct go-to-sleep techniques, but rather a mood-altering app that helps you to stay calm during the day and prepares you emotionally for going to sleep in the evening.\n\n- WHY IS BEDTIME MOOD IMPORTANT?\nNegative emotions we accumulate during the day are processed and consolidated by our brain during sleep making them more difficult to disassociate from when faced again in the future. Moreover, feeling angry, anxious, down, or, the opposite, excited, and elated, is likely to affect latencies to sleep onset and REM-sleep. People mistake it for the symptoms of a sleep disorder, but in reality, they just may be in the wrong mood for sleep.\n\n- HOW DOES LOÓNA WORK?\nFrom the wake up and during the busy day Loóna will support your emotional states with playlists and immersive stories. Each night you’ll have a recommended sleepscape. A sleepscape is a guided session that combines activity-based relaxation, storytelling, and sounds in a unique way. Complete it to shut the frantic world out, reset your mind, and create the perfect mood for sleep.\n\nLoóna saves your sleepscape sessions to your Apple Health app.\n\nThe upgrade to loóna PLUS provides access to the entire collection of sleepscapes. Our subscription options are: 1-month subscription for $12.99, 1-year subscription with a 7 day trial for $39.99 (price may vary by location).\n\nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal. Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nTerms of service: http://loona.app/terms\nPrivacy policy: http://loona.app/privacy"

      "label": "ABOUT THE APP:\nKeeping track of what you eat has been shown to help prevent and stop over-eating.\n\nThis app helps you control your diet and eat healthier, by making it easy to track what you eat. The design is optimized to make entry as quick as possible, with 1 click entry, and recent food suggestions. The built in database already has thousands of food items and if yours are not known, adding them is easy.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: \nThis app is free to download, and supported by advertisements. You can use it for free as long as you like. It is possible to remove the advertisement for a fee, which will also enable additional features.\n\nFEATURES:\n1. A simple and powerful design: The app opens directly on the entry screen, on the most recent meal, because that is what you'll use most. The design makes adding entries as simple and intuitive as possible.\n2. One tap entry with personalized suggestions: The most common food items can immediately be selected. Starting on the second day, your recent items are suggested because you may eat the same food frequently.\n3. Logging in is not needed: No personal data or contact information is required.\n4. Thousands of items already in the database: Most food items have accurate information about common serving sizes, calories, carbohydrates, protein and fat. \n5. Full off-line support: No need to be connected to the internet. \n6. Precise entry is also easy: You can accurately enter the precise amount using a slider.\n7. Daily reports: Using the menu, you can directly open the diary, which shows a summary of your day. Here you can switch between calories, protein and carbohydrates by pressing on little triangle.\n8. Track your goals: After entering your personal goals, you can use the week report to see your trends. \n9. Personal reminders help you stay on target: They are a convenient way to make sure you fill out your diary, after each meal, or at the end of the day.\n\nIt is a good idea to verify the information in the database is the same as the information on your food packaging; food nutrition fluctuates with brands and over time.\n\nMake sure to discuss your goals with your doctor or nutrition specialist.\n\nPREMIUM FEATURES:\n1. No more advertisement.\n2. A much larger food database.\n3. The ability to e-mail yourself a copy of the diary.\n4. More configuration options, including the ability to enter up to 8 separate meals a day.\n\nSUBSCRIPTION PRICING & TERMS\nThe app is free to download and use. Should you choose to upgrade, we offer a one time payment option, and an auto-renewing subscription option: Renews every three months\nPayment will be charged to your credit card through your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription renews automatically unless cancelled at least 24 hours prior to the end of the subscription period. There is no increase in price when renewing.\nAny unused portion of the free trial period will be forfeited when you purchase a subscription.\nSubscriptions can be managed and auto-renewal turned off in Account Settings in iTunes after purchase. Once purchased, refunds will not be provided for any unused portion of the term.\n\nRead our full Terms of Service at http://www.ieatbetter.com/terms.html"

      "label": "Fasting: It's time to get healthy together!\n\nHave you thought about trying IF intermittent fasting to achieve the healthiest you possible? The fasting method is scientifically proven to boost your health by facilitating your weight-loss goals and controlling your sleep cycle. Fasting: Get healthy together guides you with a tailored intermittent fasting tracker, a playful water tracker, a personalized meal plan as well as a hands-on recipe book.\n\nWhy IF Intermittent Fasting?\n1. Eat whatever you want\nThe beauty of intermittent fasting is that you can eat whatever you desire and still improve your personal health. You do not need a calorie counter or calorie tracker to reach your weight-loss and health goals. The fasting method only relies on you adhering to your fasting windows. With the Fasting app, you may choose the classic 16:8 fasting window or individually adapt your window from 12:12 to 23:1.    \n2. Lose weight sustainably  \nThe fasting method allows you to achieve your dream body in the most natural way. The simple Fasting app accompanies you and helps with an intuitive fasting tracker and water tracker. Thus, you will automatically eat less and drink more water for improved body recovery. No yo-yo effect risk will interfere with your integrated weight-loss tracker.\n3. Boost your sleep\nIF allows your body to find the needed rest from your daily stress. The sleep enhancement will come naturally without a need of a sleep tracker. You will be able to sleep through each sleep cycle and feel fully recovered in the morning. For better understanding of the sleep science, you may study the body academy in your intermittent fasting app.\n4. Recover automatically \nFasting for a large portion of the day will trigger ketosis and autophagy in your body. Ketosis means that your stored body fats are used as primary energy source. Autophagy is your body's natural method to repair damaged cells. The provided resting period for your stomach by not eating may lead to a healthy immune system. Likewise, your skin may improve and your allergy exposure may diminish. In the long run, IF intermittent fasting may support your anti-aging efforts and boost longevity. \n5. Enhance your mindfulness\nIntermittent fasting introduces a new angle on your body and soul. Your body to mind connection will prosper and help you stay calm in stressful situations and make decisions easier. Falling asleep smoothly, finding time to exercise, taking time to resonate - fasting boosts the healthiest you!\n\nWhy Fasting: Get healthy together?\nThe intermittent fasting app is a health tracker that allows you to reach your goals faster. It is your health mate with a water tracker, personalized meal plan, recipe book and weight-loss tracker. If you open the vast recipe book, you will quickly realize the beauty of IF intermittent fasting. You may eat whatever you like.

      "label": "You don’t need any special medical equipment to get your pulse and to keep track of your health state, just your phone camera! Most accurate, fast and easy to use heart rate app.\n \nAPPLIED METHOD:\n\nOur app is based on photoplethysmography (PPG), non-invasive optical technique. Each heart beat transmits the amount of blood to the tissues in your fingers, while the blood absorbs your camera’s light, it illuminates the skin and captures microvascular blood volume changes such as ebb and flow. That allows you to measure the pulse easily, accurately and efficiently.\n \nHOW TO USE:\n\nCover the camera lens and flashlight with your fingertip completely. Do not press too intensively in order to avoid reducing blood flow. Hold your phone steady and keep still. Make sure your fingers are not cold. Press the button and get your results.\n \nTRACK YOUR MEASUREMENTS:\n\nGet visual display of the data at the given period of time. Personal dashboard with your measurement history.\n \nHEALTH KIT INTEGRATION:\n\nSupport for sharing heart rate results with Apple Health App.\n \nREMINDER:\n\nReceive notifications in order to have your finger on the pulse. Staying healthy and fit is a systematic process.\n \nIMPROVE YOUR PERFORMANCE:\nTrack your workout effectiveness to get in shape, improve your endurance and general wellness.\n \nNEVER MISS A BEAT!\n \nSUBSCRIPTION INFO:\n \nYearly subscription with 3-day free trial period will give you full access to \n* Unlimited measurements per day, \n* Monthly statistics,\n* Health insights, \n* No ads.\n \nDisclaimer: App measurements are just recommendations and can’t be used for diagnostics or medical purpose. Always seek a doctor's advice before making any medical decisions.\n\nPlease note that the app doesn't measure blood pressure, oxygen levels and body temperature, you can only record and keep measurement indexs! You need a thermometer, a tonometer and a pulse oximeter to measure values. Save your measurements in \"Heart Rate\".\n \nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\nSubscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period.\n \nSubscriptions may be managed by you and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to iTunes Account Settings. For more information please visit the link https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202039. No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during the active subscription period. Unused portion of a free-trial period will be forfeited when a user decides to subscribe.\n \nTerms: http://codabrasoft.com/Terms.html\nPrivacy Policy: http://codabrasoft.com/Privacy.html"

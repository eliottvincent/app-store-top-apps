Whichever path you choose to take, you won't be able to escape the zombie hordes - your only choice is to smash through them!\n\nBUILD A ZOMBIE-SLAUGHTERING MACHINE\nUnlock and upgrade 10 different vehicles, including a sports car, a fire truck, and even an ice-cream van. Each vehicle can be equipped with a range of upgrades, such as armored frames, roof-mounted guns, boosters and more. Those zombies will stand no chance.\n\nDESTRUCTIBLE VEHICLES\nVehicles are now fully destructible. Hang on for your life as your vehicle gets smashed to smithereens if you aren't too careful.\n\nMORE ZOMBIES. MORE DESTRUCTION. MORE MAYHEM.\nWhat are you waiting for? That rescue ship isn't going to wait forever! Prepare yourself for a wild ride - and seriously, there is nothing like smashing through zombie-filled factories!"

      "label": "\"Unruly Heroes” is a 2D action-adventure mobile game developed by the indie team at Magic Design Studios and published by Perfect World. The story is inspired by China’s first mythological novel \"Journey to the West” and strives to bring players an innovative experience through a fantastical art style and hilarious plot.\nSince the dawn of time, Buddhist scripture held the balance between Heaven, Earth, and the myriad creatures. However, as Evil’s wickedness began to grow, this delicate balance was thrown into chaos when the divine scripture was torn to pieces and scattered across the land. Those creatures that have encountered the mythical power of the fragments inherited unprecedented power. In doing so, this newfound strength kindled their heart’s innermost wickedness, turning them into horrifying monsters. With a world in chaos, a master and his three disciples accept Guan Yin’s decree and set out to reunite the fragments into a new scripture.\nThe game follows the journey of a master and his three disciples as they fight, solve puzzles, collect loot, parkour, platform and more on their mystical demon-slaying adventure. You must capitalize on their special attacks and holy relics in a battle of wit and bravery against demons to complete their pilgrimage in reuniting the scripture.\nFollowing its release on Steam and consoles, the mobile edition of “Unruly Heroes” is now available!\nHighlights:\nFantastic hand-drawn art style—Rich and in-depth level design illustrates a vivid sense of realism.\nSwitch between the master and disciples—Effortlessly switch between the four characters both in and out of combat to overcome puzzles and obstacles.\nRich and varied gameplay—Over ten different gameplay elements including: fighting, puzzle solving, loot collecting, parkour, platforming and more.\n\nAwards\n“Unruly Heroes” won the 47th Annie Award for best game character animation.\n\nFacebook: @UnrulyHeroesGame\nDeveloper Info: Magic Design Studios\nOfficial website: www.magicdesignstudios.com"

It may not be the most challenging part,  but it is the most essential section in the game since you need to keep advancing through it to unlock further sections of  the game.\r\n\r\nOnce you have passed a certain dungeon level, you can unlock  “Altar of the Darkness” , “Boss Mode” and “Clock Tower of Challenges”. Those are where the true test of skill and power happens. For our shadow hunters to overcome those challenges, mastering the fighting technique is a must, understanding the characteristics of each demon and preparing a suitable strategy is needed and strengthening the shadow equipment is a huge plus. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, shadow hunters can not only liberate the mortal world from those dark demons but also can test their skills and mastery against other fellows of the shadow. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMULTIPLE CHARACTERS TO PLAY AND ROLL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlayers will get to play as multiple different characters, each has its own unique skills, gameplay and assets. Each character is going to be a distinct way to play the game, a distinct  approach to the strategy and the combat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKEY FEATURES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIntense hack and slash combat.\r\n\r\nEpic Boss Fights.\r\n\r\nMultiple characters to play.\r\n\r\nHundreds of equipment and weapons to loot and upgrade.\r\n\r\n4+ PVE modes and PVP.\r\n\r\nPlay anytime, anywhere even when offline.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVisit Here to Learn More About Shadow Hunter:\r\n\r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/SHLostWorld\r\n\r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/shlostworld"

      "label": "\"Did you know that “Schadenfreude” is a German word defined as the concept of finding joy in someone else’s misfortune? It is also the main idea on which Neighbours back From Hell is built. A whole TV show based on playing increasingly outrageous pranks on your grumpy neighbor to keep the audience entertained, and viewership numbers high. It’s good to be bad in this early 2000s trash TV-inspired slapstick extravaganza! \n\nAs Woody, the vengeful star protagonist of Neighbours back From Hell, you will prank your way through Seasons 1 and 2 of the fictitious, but aptly named TV show. Take the mischief from your nasty neighbor’s flat all the way to China, India, and Mexico where you will make sure his holiday is a living hell. While you’re at it, why limit targeting your antics at your neighbor, when you can involve his mother and fellow travelers? Whatever you decide to do, your trusty camera crew will be right there and keep a keen eye on all the action. You can let your crooked creativity flow freely and watch the neighbor rage in desperation. Just be mindful not to get caught by him or his companions, or they will whoop you good and your TV show will be taken off the air. If you perform well on the other hand, by creating more and more disarray and chaos in the neighbor’s life, ratings will increase, and you could win prestigious awards. \"\n\nNeighbours From Hell 1 & 2 Remastered in one package: 28 episodes set in the neighbor’s home, on a cruise liner, and in several different holiday locations around the world \n\n- All graphics newly rendered in Full HD \n- Framerate of all animations doubled for a smoother experience  \n- Use stealth, skill, and style to perform the perfect ambush \n- Easy to use interface and controls \n- Superb cartoon-style graphics \n- Big band soundtrack \n- Game Center support\r\n- Full controller support\n\n© HandyGames"

However, in the ensuing age of peace, the Night Chasers were no longer needed, and were forced to disband. Years later, four young people - Zack, Lucien, Sid, and Odelia - decided to carry on their legacy, forming the new Night Chasers.\n\nOne day, Zack and his party save an Elven girl named Dolores. Suffering from amnesia, Dolores cannot remember why she has ventured so far from the Elven Kingdom – only that she has been sent on an urgent quest. Concerned for her well-being, the Night Chasers take her into their fold, leading them to discover an ancient and terrible threat to the kingdom...\n\n** Recommend to use iPhone 6/iPad min4/iPad Air2/iPad 5th Gen./iPad Pro or later devices for better experiences.**"

      "label": "Build and serve sundaes on the go with this brand-new version of Papa's Freezeria, with gameplay and controls reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch!\r\n\r\nYou've just started a relaxing summer job at an oceanfront ice cream shop, but things get hectic when all of Papa Louie's customers arrive on the island!  You'll need to whip up delicious Freezer sundaes by pouring ice cream, adding mixables and syrups, blending sundaes, adding whipped cream and toppings, and don't forget the cherry on top for a perfect summertime treat!\r\n\r\nYou'll need to multitask between each area of the restaurant, with new controls designed to work just right in the palm of your hand.  Head to the Order Station to watch for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Build Station to combine ice cream and mixables for each sundae.  Jump to the Mix Station to mix sundaes until they're blended just right.  Hop to the Top Station to pour whipped cream and toppings before serving the sundae to your picky customers.  Each Station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the sundae-building process.\r\n\r\nKeep your customers happy to earn points and level up.  As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings for the shop, and new customers will start to visit the Freezeria!  A well-crafted sundae also earns you tips, which you can spend on upgrades and decorations for the lobby!\r\n\r\n** NEW FOR PAPA'S FREEZERIA TO GO**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers won't get in the way of the action!\r\n\r\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  You can also use buttons in the top corners to quickly switch Order Tickets, and you can view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.\r\n\r\nBUILD STATION - We've completely redesigned the Build Station for smaller screens.  The Pour Button and Bonus Meter are moved to the side and sized just right for your thumb, so you can watch the meter and tap at the right time without any fingers blocking your view.  When it's time to choose a mixable or a syrup, the entire screen is filled with large buttons so you can easily tap the correct item.\r\n\r\nMIX STATION - We've fine-tuned the Mix Station upgrades to work even better on small touch screens.  Once you purchase the Blend Alarm upgrades, you can drag these large alarms and snap them onto any blender.  Booster Buttons are also large and easy to press, and you can even use multi-touch to boost multiple blenders at once!\r\n\r\nTOP STATION - The Topping Bin carousel from \"Papa's Burgeria To Go!\" is back, which lets you top sundaes in a brand-new way!  Swipe the carousel of Topping Bins to choose the item you want to use, then grab the sundae cup to start pouring toppings evenly across the sundae.  You can also tap a button to switch to placeable items like cherries and cookies.  And with full multi-touch support, you can keep one finger sliding the bins and another tapping on the cup below, so you'll have those sundaes finished in no time!\r\n\r\nNEW INGREDIENTS - We've added a ton of new ingredients that can't be found in the classic or HD versions of the game, including mixables, syrups, whipped cream flavors, and other toppings that you'll unlock as you play the game.  There's over 70 unique ingredients for you to discover!\r\n\r\n**GAME FEATURES**\r\n\r\n- Hands-on ice cream shop in the Papa Louie universe\r\n- All new controls and gameplay designed for smaller screens\r\n- Multi-task between building, mixing, and topping\r\n- Shop to buy upgrades using your in-game tips\r\n- 85 customers to unlock with unique orders\r\n- Challenging Closers and Food Critic\r\n- 120 in-game achievements to earn\r\n\r\n**NOTE FOR iPAD USERS**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is designed especially for smaller screens.  If you're looking for large-screen gameplay, check out \"Papa's Freezeria HD\" for iPad!"

      "label": "In a land far, far away there once was a vast continent called Milton. It was a land where the power of rule came by the sword and the arcane, where Men who devoted themselves to the blade or to magecraft, could become the finest warriors, wisest wizards or the greatest adventurers. In this land, there are several kingdoms divided by borders but united through history. Countless stories of alliances, upheaval, and moments of peace bedeck this tapestry, but that is a tale for another day. \n\nOur story begins in a remote kingdom to the north, Iblis, an obscure and oft-forgotten place. It is a wild and barren land, a place where its people scrape a living from the earth, mining minerals for the lords of the south. On occasion, adventurers would stop by for the night but never linger. Until one day, a fledgling adventurer lost his way and stumbled into a hole. The story might have ended then had he not come back, but return he did, with sacks of gold and glittering treasure. \n\nLike a fierce gale from the north, news of his fame and fortune fanned across the kingdoms overnight, and kings sent their bravest warriors and adventurers to clear the cavern of monsters in search of treasure. Even peasants wanting a part of this newfound wealth partook in these expeditions. In no time at all, a bustling town had sprung up in this forgotten place. People set up camps, and formed their own groups to explore the cave. Clever merchants not missing this opportunity, built taverns and shops near the cave, selling equipment and potions to eager adventurers. At first, everything seemed fine. As explorers delved into the caves, they encountered new creatures and discovered new treasures. Mysteries continued to pour forth from the cave, yet nobody knew where the source of the secrets lay. However, as the explorations continued, the balance of wealth beyond the cave began to waver, and cracks appeared among those adventurers who had previously worked arm-in-arm. The latecomers or weak, limited to wandering the upper levels of the cave, could only watch as the veteran adventurers brought treasure after treasure from the deep. They began harboring dark thoughts as they watched the veteran adventurers grow arrogant from their largesse, ordering people around, hoarding secrets from the rest. The place became a festering pool of suspicions and greed, mired in a jealous rage. \n\nIt started with an adventurer disappearing in the cave. Rumors circulated he had found some legendary treasure and hoarded it for himself. Others said he had been guided to another world by some mysterious magic force in the cave. Still, the unspoken belief was that he had been murdered by a rival party and was buried somewhere beneath the caverns. Nobody knows exactly what happened, but people have continued to disappear ever since. As more people have gone missing, some adventurers have called it quits, others cling to hope, and a few continue to wait and see. Which brings us to you, an ordinary young man, coming into this extraordinary circumstance with purposes unknown to others. May you find what you seek in ...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\nIn \" The Greedy Cave\", you are a brave adventurer tasked with exploring a mysterious cave and battling all kinds of monsters.\n\nUse your wits to defeat them, learn different skills, gain mighty equipment, challenge evil monster bosses, and decipher the mystery surrounding this cave...\n\nGame Features\n·Randomly generated cave levels provide a different game experience every time!                     \n·Hundreds of monsters to defeat!\n·Hundreds of equipment to collect!\n·Hundreds of quests and achievements to conquer!\n·Enchant/Reform/Level up/Gold collecting, and more abundant systems to explore!\n\nContact us\ncs.thegreedycave@avalongames.com\nhttps://www.facebook.com/greedycave/"

They are kid-friendly, updated with the latest in facial recognition technology, tied into local criminal databases, and promise to put on a safe and entertaining show for kids and grown-ups alike!\n\nWhat could go wrong?\n\nAs the new security guard working nights, your job is to monitor cameras and make sure nothing goes wrong after-hours. The previous guard has complained about the characters trying to get into the office (he has since been moved to day-shift). So to make your job easier, you've been provided with your very own empty Freddy Fazbear head, which should fool the animatronic characters into leaving you alone if they should accidentally enter your office.\n\nAs always, Fazbear Entertainment is not responsible for death or dismemberment.\n\nNOTE: Interface and audio in English.

The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman.\n\nFrom your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if Freddybear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed!\n\nCan you survive five nights at Freddy's?\n\n\"For all the simplicity of the game’s controls and premise, Five Nights at Freddy‘s is frightening. It’s a fantastic example of how cleverness in design and subtlety can be used to make an experience terrifying. Simple still images and proper character design steal the show in this game, and show that Scott Cawthon knows quite a lot about the secret fears people feel when looking at creepy dolls and toys. It’s elegant in how it sows fear, and is a must-own for anyone who likes scary games.\" -Joel Couture IndieGameMag.com\n\nNOTE: Interface and audio in English. Subtitles in English, French, German, Dutch, Spanish (Latin America), Italian, Portuguese (Brazil), Russian, Japanese, Chinese (Simplified), Korean.\n\n#MadeWithFusion"

      "label": "You are the owner of an aquarium where there are not only lovely colorful fish but they can also generate money for you. But life isn't all rosy, one fine day your beautiful aquarium caught the attention of hordes of evil aliens. They are determined to find ways to invade your aquarium. This is the moment when the player shows his \"master control\". Let your love fish teach the aliens a life-long lesson, kick them out of the territory and never dared to come in again.\n\nI. Style play\nTendFish has an unfussy and complicated gameplay, suitable for all ages, especially young gamers. You have to protect and develop your fishes against the attack of monsters who are trying to eat the poor fish. In particular, to repay the favor, your fish after a certain time will release a coin to help you earn income to expand your aquarium.\nTo feed the fish, you just need to touch the place where you want to drop food for them. When facing dangerous sea monsters, use laser guns to intercept and attack first to win. There are a total of 5 tanks, each with 5 rounds, the 5th tank has only one round because this is the round with the boss monster of the game.\n\nII. Mission\nYour main task is to feed your fish at the right time, at the right time, protect them from the dangers of evil fish and monsters. You have to destroy evil fish and collect eggshells to earn money, when you have enough 3 eggshells, you will be through the door and can own more effective assistants. Also be a wise investor, use your funds to buy more fish, unlock secret pets and upgrade your aquarium.\n\nIII. Game mode\nThe game has 4 different game modes including: Bonus Adventure, Time Trial, Challenge and Virtual Tank, each with different missions and gameplay.\n\n- Adventure: In this mode, at each round the player will be given a few guppies, raised to grow so that they spawn coins or diamonds. To finish a round, we must buy 3 pieces of an egg. The egg will hatch a special creature, which can help the player in later rounds. Players also have to fight monsters to protect the fish by using lasers and shooting them in the head.\n- Challenge: This is the hardest level of the 4 modes. The gameplay is similar to Adventure mode, collect all 3 pieces of the egg to pass the round. But the difficulty here is that every 4 seconds, the price of the items will increase by 1%. In this mode, the longer you play, the more monsters will appear, the amount of items will increase, the difficulty will be higher.\n- Time Trial: The task in this mode is that the player must earn as much money as possible in a certain period of time (5 minutes in the first lake and 10 minutes in the other 3 pools). By completing the quest in each tank in Adventure mode, the player will unlock the corresponding tank in the Time Trial.\n- Virtual Tank: This is the easiest mode. Players just need to feed the fish, collect coins, diamonds ..., use that money to buy more fish from the store. The special thing is that the fish in Virtual Tank never die.\n\nTendFish possesses a variety of eye-catching graphics but still retains something very similar to reality. The image of the fish as well as the boss's image is extremely cute and close to children. The shimmering scene of the aquarium makes many hearts melt.\n\nEspecially the game is only purchased once and contains no ads.\nHave fun playing the game!"

It may not be the most challenging part,  but it is the most essential section in the game since you need to keep advancing through it to unlock further sections of  the game.\r\n\r\nOnce you have passed a certain dungeon level, you can unlock  “Altar of the Darkness” , “Boss Mode” and “Clock Tower of Challenges”. Those are where the true test of skill and power happens. For our shadow hunters to overcome those challenges, mastering the fighting technique is a must, understanding the characteristics of each demon and preparing a suitable strategy is needed and strengthening the shadow equipment is a huge plus. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, shadow hunters can not only liberate the mortal world from those dark demons but also can test their skills and mastery against other fellows of the shadow. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMULTIPLE CHARACTERS TO PLAY AND ROLL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlayers will get to play as multiple different characters, each has its own unique skills, gameplay and assets. Each character is going to be a distinct way to play the game, a distinct  approach to the strategy and the combat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKEY FEATURES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIntense hack and slash combat.\r\n\r\nEpic Boss Fights.\r\n\r\nMultiple characters to play.\r\n\r\nHundreds of equipment and weapons to loot and upgrade.\r\n\r\n4+ PVE modes and PVP.\r\n\r\nPlay anytime, anywhere even when offline.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVisit Here to Learn More About Shadow Hunter:\r\n\r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/SHLostWorld\r\n\r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/shlostworld"

      "label": "\"Unruly Heroes” is a 2D action-adventure mobile game developed by the indie team at Magic Design Studios and published by Perfect World. The story is inspired by China’s first mythological novel \"Journey to the West” and strives to bring players an innovative experience through a fantastical art style and hilarious plot.\nSince the dawn of time, Buddhist scripture held the balance between Heaven, Earth, and the myriad creatures. However, as Evil’s wickedness began to grow, this delicate balance was thrown into chaos when the divine scripture was torn to pieces and scattered across the land. Those creatures that have encountered the mythical power of the fragments inherited unprecedented power. In doing so, this newfound strength kindled their heart’s innermost wickedness, turning them into horrifying monsters. With a world in chaos, a master and his three disciples accept Guan Yin’s decree and set out to reunite the fragments into a new scripture.\nThe game follows the journey of a master and his three disciples as they fight, solve puzzles, collect loot, parkour, platform and more on their mystical demon-slaying adventure. You must capitalize on their special attacks and holy relics in a battle of wit and bravery against demons to complete their pilgrimage in reuniting the scripture.\nFollowing its release on Steam and consoles, the mobile edition of “Unruly Heroes” is now available!\nHighlights:\nFantastic hand-drawn art style—Rich and in-depth level design illustrates a vivid sense of realism.\nSwitch between the master and disciples—Effortlessly switch between the four characters both in and out of combat to overcome puzzles and obstacles.\nRich and varied gameplay—Over ten different gameplay elements including: fighting, puzzle solving, loot collecting, parkour, platforming and more.\n\nAwards\n“Unruly Heroes” won the 47th Annie Award for best game character animation.\n\nFacebook: @UnrulyHeroesGame\nDeveloper Info: Magic Design Studios\nOfficial website: www.magicdesignstudios.com"

      "label": "Bad North DOES NOT support: iPhone 5S, 6, 6 Plus, iPad Air/Mini 2, 3/iPod Touch 6th gen and lower\n\nYour home is under attack. The king is dead at the hands of Viking invaders. Hope is a distant glimmer in the fog, fading fast with every passing moment. As you rise to take your father’s place as ruler, it will fall to you to stage your defenses. But make no mistake – this is no fight for victory, but a desperate grasp for survival. \n\nBad North is a charming but brutal real-time tactics roguelite. Defend your idyllic island kingdom against a horde of Viking invaders, as you lead the desperate exodus of your people. Command your loyal subjects to take full tactical advantage of the unique shape of each island. Everything is at stake: fail, and watch the blood of your subjects stain the ground red.\n\nIt’s charmingly brutal, with beautiful procedurally-generated islands and adorable soldiers juxtaposed against the blood-stained realities of war. You control the broad strokes of the battle, giving high level commands to your soldiers who try their best to carry them out in the heat of the moment. It’s accessibly deep, with simple player inputs masking a dynamic combat simulation that make it inviting to new players while challenging veterans.\nKeep fighting, warriors. Not for power or riches or glory, but for hope of peace to come once again in the harsh lands of the Bad North.\n\nKey Features\n\nREAL-TIME TACTICS ROGUELITE:  Position and relocate your troops to fend off the Vikings, who each have their own counters to the threats you pose. Pick your battles and plan your evacuations carefully! Lose a commander and they’re gone forever; lose everything, and it’s game over! \n\nINTELLIGENT UNIT CONTROLS: You command the broad strokes of your defenses and monitor positioning — your soldiers do the rest, navigating and engaging intuitively in response to the situation at hand.\n\nPROCEDURALLY-GENERATED ISLANDS: Each island is both stylistically charming and unique in its layout. Plan your strategies around every nook and cranny, for you only get one chance to save them from the enemy invasion.\n\nUNLOCKABLE UPGRADES: A stronger, smarter defense leads to greater rewards. Use these to develop your subjects from a ragtag militia into seasoned warriors."

      "label": "Build and serve sundaes on the go with this brand-new version of Papa's Freezeria, with gameplay and controls reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch!\r\n\r\nYou've just started a relaxing summer job at an oceanfront ice cream shop, but things get hectic when all of Papa Louie's customers arrive on the island!  You'll need to whip up delicious Freezer sundaes by pouring ice cream, adding mixables and syrups, blending sundaes, adding whipped cream and toppings, and don't forget the cherry on top for a perfect summertime treat!\r\n\r\nYou'll need to multitask between each area of the restaurant, with new controls designed to work just right in the palm of your hand.  Head to the Order Station to watch for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Build Station to combine ice cream and mixables for each sundae.  Jump to the Mix Station to mix sundaes until they're blended just right.  Hop to the Top Station to pour whipped cream and toppings before serving the sundae to your picky customers.  Each Station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the sundae-building process.\r\n\r\nKeep your customers happy to earn points and level up.  As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings for the shop, and new customers will start to visit the Freezeria!  A well-crafted sundae also earns you tips, which you can spend on upgrades and decorations for the lobby!\r\n\r\n** NEW FOR PAPA'S FREEZERIA TO GO**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers won't get in the way of the action!\r\n\r\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  You can also use buttons in the top corners to quickly switch Order Tickets, and you can view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.\r\n\r\nBUILD STATION - We've completely redesigned the Build Station for smaller screens.  The Pour Button and Bonus Meter are moved to the side and sized just right for your thumb, so you can watch the meter and tap at the right time without any fingers blocking your view.  When it's time to choose a mixable or a syrup, the entire screen is filled with large buttons so you can easily tap the correct item.\r\n\r\nMIX STATION - We've fine-tuned the Mix Station upgrades to work even better on small touch screens.  Once you purchase the Blend Alarm upgrades, you can drag these large alarms and snap them onto any blender.  Booster Buttons are also large and easy to press, and you can even use multi-touch to boost multiple blenders at once!\r\n\r\nTOP STATION - The Topping Bin carousel from \"Papa's Burgeria To Go!\" is back, which lets you top sundaes in a brand-new way!  Swipe the carousel of Topping Bins to choose the item you want to use, then grab the sundae cup to start pouring toppings evenly across the sundae.  You can also tap a button to switch to placeable items like cherries and cookies.  And with full multi-touch support, you can keep one finger sliding the bins and another tapping on the cup below, so you'll have those sundaes finished in no time!\r\n\r\nNEW INGREDIENTS - We've added a ton of new ingredients that can't be found in the classic or HD versions of the game, including mixables, syrups, whipped cream flavors, and other toppings that you'll unlock as you play the game.  There's over 70 unique ingredients for you to discover!\r\n\r\n**GAME FEATURES**\r\n\r\n- Hands-on ice cream shop in the Papa Louie universe\r\n- All new controls and gameplay designed for smaller screens\r\n- Multi-task between building, mixing, and topping\r\n- Shop to buy upgrades using your in-game tips\r\n- 85 customers to unlock with unique orders\r\n- Challenging Closers and Food Critic\r\n- 120 in-game achievements to earn\r\n\r\n**NOTE FOR iPAD USERS**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is designed especially for smaller screens.

      "label": "NOTE: Remastered version from the PC version. A device with at least 2 GB of RAM is required for this game to run properly.\n\nWelcome to your new summer job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, where kids and parents alike come for entertainment and food as far as the eye can see! The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman.\n\nFrom your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if Freddybear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed!\n\nCan you survive five nights at Freddy's?\n\n\"For all the simplicity of the game’s controls and premise, Five Nights at Freddy‘s is frightening. It’s a fantastic example of how cleverness in design and subtlety can be used to make an experience terrifying. Simple still images and proper character design steal the show in this game, and show that Scott Cawthon knows quite a lot about the secret fears people feel when looking at creepy dolls and toys. It’s elegant in how it sows fear, and is a must-own for anyone who likes scary games.\" -Joel Couture IndieGameMag.com\n\nNOTE: Interface and audio in English. Subtitles in English, French, German, Dutch, Spanish (Latin America), Italian, Portuguese (Brazil), Russian, Japanese, Chinese (Simplified), Korean.\n\n#MadeWithFusion"

Under the watchful eye of the documentary crew, you'll be brewing espresso, steaming and frothing milk, and crafting eye-catching layered drinks for your picky customers.  Work your way through the holidays as you serve seasonal coffee and cannoli, unlock new ingredients, and earn Daily Specials with delicious latte and macchiato recipes.\n\n-- GAME FEATURES --\n\nBREW ESPRESSO AND LAYER DRINKS - Use the Brew Machines to make freshly-brewed shots of espresso, and to steam and froth milk for the customers' drinks.

Complete the drink with toppings, whips, and drizzles for that finishing touch.\n\nCRAFTING CANNOLI - Customers will order a custom-made cannoli along with their Papaccino drinks.

      "label": "Thank you for visiting the page of \"The Heroic Legend of Eagarlnia\", it's a premium game with no in-app-purchase which you can play offline!\n\nThis is a light-weight \"grand strategy\" game with a unique original story background made by an indie team of 5. Although the gameplay is not exactly innovative, it represents our game producer's passion and understanding of the classic strategic games. With Eagarlnia, we hope to bring you an enjoyable single-player strategy game experience that you don't have to rush to make the better decision, but would be able to play wherever and whenever you are. \n\nThe game first launched an early access PC version last October. After nearly a year of tuning, we finally achieved a 30-day rating of 90%+ positive feedback, and finally we felt comfortable to bring Eagarlnia to you on mobile consoles. \n\nYou will enter a world of Swords & Magic, where there are countries with different characteristics and potential relationships, and you can choose to become the monarch of any country. Through wise management of your own territory, you will grow your economic and military strengths, and eventually conquer other countries and become the overlord of Eagarlnia.\n\nIn addition to the rich and colorful heroic paintings and pixel-style fighting scenes,  you will experience these 3 key features: \n\n1. A story-rich fantasy world with 5 living races  \nEvery existence in the world of Eagarlnia has its own story where rivals could have been sworn brothers. You will gradually discover unknown relationships between the heroes, and along the way you will establish your own exclusive network, eventually conquering them all. \n\n2. A customized gaming experience with more than 350+ heroes\nFrom the very beginning of the game, you will be able to customize the original settings of your country, the management of your wealth, the configuration of the AIs, etc. \nThere are more than 350 heroes in the game, where you can have them join your force through visiting, lobbying and capturing. Some of them are incomparable in intelligence, some are brave, some are insidious and cunning, and some are despicable. Use them wisely to become a qualified ruler. Some special heroes even have their own special artifacts, which need to be unlocked by completing specific missions.\n\n3. A game for creating your own epic story \nYou can choose from 19 forces of different advantages and skills. You can grow your force through internal affairs management, development on wealth and strength, manipulating others through diplomatic tactics, acquiring talents from battlefield, dungeon adventure and many other ways awaiting your discovery. The game is also designed to have more than a hundred kinds of troops, of which reasonable matching and deployment is key to your vicotry. In addition, there are also hidden troops with powerful abilities packed with the mysterious powers for you to unlock.\n\nFinally, we are eager to know your feedback on the game through email to thloe@pixmain.com or chat with us on Discord.\n\nIf you like the game, it's much appreciated that you would leave us a good review and rating, which would really help and support our development team in future updates and optimization! Thank you!"

Players control members of the Night Chasers, a group of heroic warriors, as they embark on an adventure to save their lands from an evil threat.\n\n[Game Features]\n◆ Thrilling match-3 battle experiences\nMatch three Emblems to clear them from the board and make your heroes attack. Clear four or more to generate Magic Emblems, allowing your heroes to unleash powerful skills. Perform combos to launch even more powerful attacks and vanquish your enemies!\n\n◆ Traditional Japanese-style RPG experience\nIn a world of magic and swordplay, players will control members of the Night Chasers as they embark on an adventure together. Enter deep caves, explore ancient ruins, unlock treasure chests, fight against ferocious monsters, upgrade your equipment in town, and gain new information from villagers in the local taverns. A exciting RPG experience is waiting for you in Hero Emblems II!\n\n◆ Substitute Heroes\nEach Hero possesses their own unique skills and backstory. There's Zack, the Human Warrior; Lucien, the Marten Knight; Sid, the Felinian Black Mage; Abner the Bard, and many more!

To fight against these tough opponents, you will need to choose your Heroes'  weapons and armor carefully, and make good use of accessories to resist enemy debuffs and boost your Heroes' abilities!\n\n◆One-time payment, IAP-free, and ad-free\n\n\nA New Chapter in the Night Chasers' History\nA long time ago, there was a mercenary group known as the Night Chasers. Instead of making money, these heroic warriors went around helping those in need. During the war, they helped a great many people who were suffering under tyranny and injustice. However, in the ensuing age of peace, the Night Chasers were no longer needed, and were forced to disband. Years later, four young people - Zack, Lucien, Sid, and Odelia - decided to carry on their legacy, forming the new Night Chasers.\n\nOne day, Zack and his party save an Elven girl named Dolores. Suffering from amnesia, Dolores cannot remember why she has ventured so far from the Elven Kingdom – only that she has been sent on an urgent quest. Concerned for her well-being, the Night Chasers take her into their fold, leading them to discover an ancient and terrible threat to the kingdom...\n\n** Recommend to use iPhone 6/iPad min4/iPad Air2/iPad 5th Gen./iPad Pro or later devices for better experiences.**"

It began with the tipping of the food-chain, which forced the humans to establish an outpost and begin an investigation in the region where the first species of mutated plants was discovered. The military has prepared a vast number of powerful weapons, with you leading the vanguard forces to wage this long war.\n\nSubverted Order\n“Many years later, when the humans watch as the plants climb up to the top of the food chain, they will be reminded of their own naivety and arrogance…”\nOnly when all the plants started to evolve into animals, growing limbs and becoming sentient, did the humans realize the threat of those photosynthetic-lifeforms. No one knows how they achieved the state of evolution that took animal lifeforms millions of years to reach in such a short amount of time, and no one knows their ultimate objective. The only thing known for sure is that the humans now face the greatest challenge since they climbed up to the top of the food chain.\n\nGameplay\nAs the first explorers of this unknown region, you must strive to venture deep into the enemy hive, defeat all kinds of fruits and arm yourself with various equipment, as well as upgrade yourself with the resources you find in your way.\n\nGame Features\n-Rougelite elements such as random terrains, loot drops, and monsters\n-Hundreds of special and bizarre weapons and items\n-Loads of unique mod enemies and bosses\n-10 characters in the roster with unique skills and abilities\n-Unique artstyle with rich details\n\nTwitter: /@JuicyRealm\nFacebook: @JuicyRealm\nPress contact: juicyrealm@spacecangames.com\n\n[Minimum Requirements]\r\n\r\nPlease make sure you are using devices matching the following requirements.

      "label": "Town Construction\n\nAs the local land god, your primary task is to watch over and guide your people as you build the town from scratch. Collect natural resources, build production and living facilities, and produce essential supplies to bring peace and prosperity to your people.\n\n\n\nResidents and Life\n\nThe residents have their own preferences and emotions. They are happy when they have nice houses to live in, and will become distressed if they don't have any entertainment. Try to observe them and build housing, arrange jobs, and provide education and necessary leisure and entertainment. Make their wishes come true to earn their worship and trust.\n\n\n\nGods and Magic\n\nAs a local land god, you have access to some basic magic like changing the location of things in town. If you want to use stronger magic, you'll have to use the offerings of your people to meet other gods that can lend you their power and help develop your town. For example, the Moon Elder can greatly increase your people's willingness to get married and have kids, while the Weather Master can help you control the weather...\n\nBuildings and Decoration\n\nYou can build and upgrade dozens of different buildings to provide your people with a better living and working environment. In addition, this game also provides hundreds of unique decorations, each with its own style. As you decorate your town, you'll find that some decorations have unique combination effects. Try out different combinations to trigger effects that will make your town more beautiful and prosperous.\n\n\n\nMonsters and Puppets\n\nThe town isn't always a peaceful place. Prosperous towns attract monsters that will come to destroy your buildings and take away your resources. You can build city walls and towers to delay monster attacks, and can also use spells as you lead your residents in battle to repel the monsters with the help of battle puppets.\nSystem Requirements\n\nEquipment support:\n- iOS 12 or later\n- iPhoneX and above\n- iPad models with more than 2 GB of ram"

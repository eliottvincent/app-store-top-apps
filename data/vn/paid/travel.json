In map view, you can tap any wifi icon where wireless information is available, and use the button to copy the password to the clipboard. The map is available offline so you don’t need an Internet connection to use WiFox when you’re traveling.\n\n*Click Copy to easily paste passwords into wireless network settings.\n\n*Users can also add passwords they find from airports around the world. Those passwords are then sent to foXnoMad for verification and approval before they are added to the map.\n\n*In ‘List View’ you can update passwords for airports already added (when you’ve noticed some changes). As you travel you can also rate the wireless hotspot information to let us know if the details worked for you or not. Based on traveler feedback, the connection information is updated, verified, or removed.\n\n*WiFox icons indicate how fresh, reliable, and highly rated a given airport wireless network’s information is.\n\n*WiFox is updated continuously with information travelers, pilots, and other users send through the WiFox app, foXnoMad website, and foXnoMad Facebook and Twitter accounts. WiFox currently has wireless Internet information for over 700 airports around the world.\n\n*The map is updated automatically upon opening the app (when you have Internet access) or by clicking the ‘Update’ button on the map or refresh icon on the List View.\n\n*WiFox also protects users on free (open) wifi networks by telling you the proper network name, so you don't unintentionally connect to a rogue or malicious access point.\n\nWiFox Premium subscriptions unlock the following features:\n\n* Automatic notifications of the highest rated password, with network connection information, as soon as you land. WiFox Premium detects the airport you're at and displays the most relevant wifi network name and password so you can get online as soon as you step off the plane.\n\n* View password ratings to see which passwords work best throughout an airport so you can connect to the strongest and most reliable connection.\n\n* Be able to add your own password ratings within WiFox. Premium user priority ratings ensure the best wifi passwords are always displayed.\n\nAfter a 30-day free trial period a $24.99/year purchase will be applied to your iTunes account following confirmation of a Premium upgrade. Subscriptions will automatically renew unless canceled within 24-hours before the end of the current period. You can cancel anytime with your iTunes account settings. Any unused portion of a free trial will be forfeited if you purchase a subscription.

      "label": "eCurrency is far more than an easy to use currency converter and handy calculator. It supports over 200 popular currencies; works without active internet connection and even supports custom rates. eCurrency offers rich graphical charts for all exchange rates and supports calculations with historical exchange rates, making this the perfect tool for business, overseas travel and for anyone interested in currency trading.\n\neCurrency offers the following features:\n\n► Easy-to-use appealing interface\n► One screen for all major functionalities\n► Designated keypad for fast number entry; plus a handy built-in math’s calculator\n► Configures up to 8 converters; swipe through as on the iPhone‘s home screen\n► Supports over 200 currencies (for a full list see: http://bit.ly/knBkeS)\n► Detailed graphical charts for all exchange rates (1-week, 1-month, 3-months, 6-months, 1-year, 2-years, and 5-years)\n► Automatic setting of home currency and number formatting \n► Reliable functionality: No active internet connection required\n► Exchange rates automatically updated on startup (Automatic update can be deactivated to avoid roaming costs)\n► Supports custom exchange rate entry\n► One touch reverse currency conversion\n► Special ‘shake to inverse calculation’ feature\n► Select and create a list of preferred currencies for fast access\n\n\n==Easy to use interface==\neCurrency interface is designed for ease of use. Just start the application and type in the amount you want to convert and eCurrency converts instantly. Tap on one of the flags to change the currency you want to convert to. A built-in calculator allows for math calculations. The current exchange rate and rate change compared to the previous day is conveniently displayed in the main interface.\n\n==Favorites Support==\neCurrency supports over 200 currencies. The “Favorites” functionality allows you to define the currency pairs you use as favorites. To create a new favorite go into the “Settings” and touch the “+” Button. You can swipe through all your favorites on the main calculation interface just as you swipe the pages on the iPhone’s home screen.\n\n== Charts and Historic Rates==\neCurrency provides detailed historical charts for all exchange rates.

The application obtains its exchange rates from our self-developed Currency-Provider-engine that aggregates rates data from multiple sources to secure the reliability of exchange rate updates.\n\n== Tutorial & Support==\nOn the first startup a short self-running demo is displayed to introduce you to the app. We appreciate any reviews or comments you may have on eCurrency in iTunes. If you have any questions please contact us directly, as we are unable to respond to your enquiries via iTunes."

      "label": "A simple and easy to use odometer. GPS Odometer only does one thing, and does it well: measure distance traveled. Includes run in background capability. Ideal for almost anything that requires measuring outdoor distance traveled such as walking, running, driving, boating, or hiking.  Note that GPS does not work well under a roof.  For best results, use outdoors.\n\nBenefits of the paid version:\n- Landscape and splitscreen support.\n- Ability to have multiple trips.  Each trip can be stopped and started independently.\n- Receive notifications while the application is closed at distance intervals of your choosing.\n- Custom units readout.  For example, you want to know how many calories you have burned.  You can customize this to include anything that has a linear relationship with distance traveled.  This can be different for each trip.\n- No advertisements.\n- Export trips via email and optionally restore later.\n\nDisplays:\n- Distance\n- Time elapsed\n- Speed (average or current)\n- Displacement (straight line distance from your starting point) This can be hidden.\n\nDistance units include:\n- Kilometers\n- Miles\n- Nautical miles\n- Meters\n- Feet\n\nSpeed units include:\n- Kilometers per hour\n- Miles per hour\n- Nautical miles per hour\n- Meters per second\n- Feet per second\n\nOther features:\n- Large font adjustable display.\n- Accurate to within 1 percent when compared to most car odometers under normal driving conditions.\n- Includes a lock to help prevent accidental reset of your trip. After unlocked, it locks back in a few seconds, or you can lock it yourself.\n- Approximates distance traveled in some GPS dead spots such as driving through a tunnel by adding the as-a-bird flies distance to your trip.\n\nPlease also note:\n- GPS Odometer does run in the background if you leave it running.  Be sure to pause the trip when you are finished or battery life will be negatively affected.  The timer stops when the trip is paused.\n- To change the display, tap the unlock button and notice the three green boxes that temporarily appear. Each button adjusts a different part of the display.\n- You can change the language to English in the application settings.\n\nPlease visit the web page for more details."

Boarding Pass Scanner helps you to decode it quickly and easily.  \n\nSimply launch the application, click on \"Scan Barcode,\" and point your camera at the 2D barcode on your airplane boarding pass.  All the hidden details will be displayed in an easy-to-read format.  Boarding Pass Scanner interprets the data so you can quickly see what's there.  Other barcode scanning applications simply present the encoded text, requiring you to hunt through to find the information.\n\nFeatures:\n• Display the data from any standard airline boarding pass in an easy-to-read manner\n• Easily track your flight status with no typing required\n• Ensure your frequent-flier number is encoded so you get your miles\n• Quickly share your flight information with friends and family via email\n• Validate that your TSA Pre√ access is properly encoded in your boarding pass\n\nIf you are a frequent flier, you will find that this application comes in handy, especially during irregular operations, when your flight can change at a moment's notice.  Scan the boarding pass and email it to colleagues, family, or friends so they have your updated flight information.\n\nNote that although most airlines follow the barcoded boarding pass standard (we have successfully tested dozens of airlines, around the world), some airlines don't exactly follow the standard.  As we identify them them, we continue update the app to support them.  If you find a Boarding pass that doesn't properly decode, contact our support with a clear photo of your boarding pass, and we will add support for that airline.\n\n-- Please note that this app does not change a paper boarding pass to a mobile boarding pass.  Not all airlines support mobile boarding passes at all stations; please refer to your airline for more information on obtaining mobile boarding passes.  This application presents the information encoded in a barcoded boarding pass for your inspection. --"

They are NOT computer generated rides like in many other apps.\n\nVirtual reality and the Oktoberfest\nYour certainly know the world famous Oktoberfest in Munich, Germany.\nMaybe you even visited there.\nIf so, you must have seen the Olympic roller coaster there.\nIt is not only the greatest roller coaster but the greatest attraction of the Oktoberfest altogether. Other than the beer \nJust looking at it makes many people feel sick. You can hardly imagine how it feels to ride through the five huge Olympic rings, head over heels, one after another with up to 100 kilmeters an hour.\nWith VR glasses and this app you can enjoy this breath taking ride, safely and comfortably.\nYou get the real riding experience of the full 1200 meter route of the Olympia roller coaster and the other roller coasters of the Oktoberfest.\nDuring the ride you can move your Head into every direction, even up and down. If you are sitting on a revolving chair, you can also turn around 360  degrees. This is a lot of fun and would be virtually impossible during a real roller coaster ride.\nAnd it is totally cool that you can take the ride as often as you want to - again and again! No additional costs \n\nOther than the Olympia roller coaster there are more rides included!: The Wilde Maus (Wild Mouse), that is famous for its sudden changes of direction and the Alpina roller coaster, another fast ride in virtual reality.\n\nStart the app and slip your iPhone into one of the many available Goggle VR glasses. With the help of the split screen each eye is assigned its own view.  The gyro-sensor in the iPhone, and that is special, moves the picture in front of your eyes according to how you move an bow your head. \nThis gives the impression of having a look around in a real room or environment. \n\nMany VR goggles you can use, for example ($2-$200),\n\n- Google Cardboard\n- ZEISS VR ONE\n- Homido\n- Durovis Dive\n- DODOcase\n- Andoer\n- Stooksy\n- VRB60.3D\n- Archos\n- visusVR\n- Refugio 3D\n- ColorCross VR\n- VIGICA Virtual Reality Headset\n- SUNNYPEAK®\n- SimpleVR®\n- A24 Colorcross\n- JoyGeek Google Cardboard\n- TechIntheBox ColorCross\n- EightOnes VR Kit\n- AGPtek®\n- Soyan 2015\n- NewSilkRoad Google Cardboard\n- KKmoon CST-01\n- Konsait Google Cardboard\n- FIVESUNG®\n- DESTEK®\n- Ematic EVR410\n- JoyGeek Google Cardboard\n- Neomark®\n- AFUNTA Universal VR\n- RiTech Virtual Reality\n- Yosoo®\n- ZwTech Google Cardboard\n- Google Cardboard Valencia\n- Virtual Reality VR TRID Screen Headset D601\n- Angelia DIY Google Cardboard\n- HLPB Google Cardboard\n- EUG Google Cardboard\n- KKmoon New Arrival DIY\n- FAVOLCANO®\n- Mi3D Virtual Reality\n- VR Envy Velocity\n- Kollea Version Google 3D\n- Valuetom®\n\n... and so much more.\n\n\nVR setup: With VR cardboard scan you can scan the QR code for your vr headset for right settings.\n\n\niPhone 4s, 5C, 5, 5S, 6, 6 Plus, 6S, 6S Plus, iPod touch\n\nSystem requirements:  iOS 8.1, iPhone, iPod touch or iPad.\nImportant: Please make sure that you have a VR glass for iPhone and/or iPad in order to see the app in VR View."

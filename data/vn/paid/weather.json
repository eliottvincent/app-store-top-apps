      "label": "*** AeroWeather: for pilots, aviation enthusiasts, and everyone who is serious about the weather!\n*** Current and precise weather conditions (METAR) and forecasts (TAF).\n\nAeroWeather Pro provides quick and intuitive access to METAR and TAF for airports worldwide. Data can be shown in its original (raw) format or as fully decoded and easy understandable texts. AeroWeather Pro is helpful for weather preflight-briefings, but also to just get very precise weather. All weather data is cached for offline access. \n\nIn addition to weather data, AeroWeather Pro integrates also airport NOTAMs (provided by US FAA), webcam images around airports (provided by windy.com), FlightService access (US only), and US ATC delay information (provided by US FAA). AeroWeather Pro also offers built-in groups for earthquakes, nearby stations, and today widget (pre iOS14), which can be individually enabled on the top level view. Besides creating user groups it’s also possible to put stations on the same level user groups (e.g. home base). Depending on your needs, groups can be shown or hidden in the main list view. User groups can also be synchronized via Cloud Kit*. \n\nThe app features a built-in airport database, which includes airport data like runways, sunrise/sunset, twilight times, moon times, timezones etc. \n\nMETAR alert notifications** is another new and helpful feature to stay up-to-date. Define multiple alerts for each station with criteria like: flight rule (US NOAA), wind speed, temperature, pressure, present weather, visibility etc. Notifications will be sent to your device if the criteria is met (e.g., when flight rule becomes IFR).\n\nDedicated METAR/TAF** access is optionally available. METAR/TAF data will come primarily from a certified ANSP (air navigation service provider) and is provided reliably and fast from our dedicated, redundant servers (indicated by blue checkmark underneath METAR/TAF).\n\nThe AeroPix feature offers users the possibility to take quickly picture(s) of the weather at their current location. \n\nAeroWeather Pro comes with an Apple Watch app, which shows either a list of stations as defined in the Apple Watch group or all nearby stations based on the current location. METAR and TAF are displayed for each station. In addition, you can put AeroWeather as a complication in your watch face to stay up-to-date. \n\nAn iMessage app is also included which lets you easily send METAR/TAF of any airport to other users.\n\nPlease consult our web-site for a full description of all features. \n\n* Additional functionality which needs to be unlocked (one-time purchase). These purchases are not transferable between Lite, Pro, and Mac.\n\n** SUBSCRIPTIONS\nAdditional features which generate recurring operation costs for us will be offered within a subscription. The following features are enabled while 'First' subscription is active:\n - Dedicated METAR/TAF data source\n - Meteograms\n - Alert push notifications\n - D-ATIS (bigger US airports only)\n - Area Forecast Discussions (currently US only)\n - Home Screen Widgets for METAR, Plot, Meteogram (iOS 14 or higher)\n - Imagery and Charts (requires 'Captain' subscription)\n - SIGMETs (requires 'Captain' subscription)\n\nAdditional features are also enabled when using AeroWeather Lite.\n\nThe subscription varies in time periods (1 month, 12 months). The subscription is valid in both AeroWeather Lite and Pro. Cross app subscription support is only available if iCloud (with the same Apple ID) is enabled. Previously purchased unlock features are not affected and will work with or without subscription.\n\nAuto-renewal may be turned off at any time by going to your account settings. A payment will be charged to your iTunes account at the end of the free trial period. Your iTunes account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. No commitment - you can cancel any time.\n\nPleas read the full “Subscription Terms of Use” at:\nhttps://www.lakehorn.com/subscription-terms-of-use/"

It also displays the current temperature and humidity.\n• Display barometric pressure (sensor value) or mean sea level pressure (MSLP - value used in weather forecast services or stations).\n• Units support for pressure: mb, inHg, kPa, atm, Torr, psi, hPa, mmHg. Units for altitude: meter, feet.\n• Calibrate the barometer using altitude/location from the GPS. Calibrate the altimeter using the nearest airport information/METAR, or manually enter the QNH of the nearest airport. Offset sensor output value.\n• Measure the height (building/mountain/hiked/climbed) using the \"Relative Altitude\" feature (can be enabled in the app's Settings).\n• Notification about pressure change. \"Notification custom rule\" for you to define how and when the app sends notifications.\nNotify when air pressure changes indicate that extreme or worse weather may occur.\n• \"Pressure Tracking\" and \"History Graph\" require \"Background App Refresh\" or \"Always Location Service\" with \"Exact update interval\" enabled.\n• \"My Area\" allows you to define your frequent stay places, and the app tracks air pressure with location data.\n• Export history to CSV format and Today widget.\n• This app is the digital version compared with an aneroid or mercury barometer and can be adjusted to MSLP with additional features.\n\nCUSTOMIZABLE:\nYou can change your barometer/altimeter appearance with:\n• Seven different housing colors.\n• Black, white or blue disk background.\n• Four different app backgrounds.\n• Three different types of needles.\n• Marker needle for easily monitor.\n• Dark or light Today widget theme.\n\nNOTES:\n• App only works on devices with a barometer sensor, such as iPhone 6/6s/7/8/X/11/12/13 (including Plus models), iPad Mini 4/Air 2/Pro, or later.\n• Weather icons on the dial: This only shows the air pressure trend like in an analog barometer.\n• Each time your device reboots, open the app for tracking with the \"Exact update interval\" feature work.\n• You may take the phone/tablet far away from computers, cables, and other magnetic sources to get accurate results.\n• This app is Pro / Premium version of the \"Barometer Plus - Altimeter\" app, only difference is all feature unlocked and no ads.

Tidal information is essential for navigating a shallow waterway or placing your boat at anchor.  The success or failure of a voyage can depend on the height or depth of a tide, while knowledge of current information can save fuel and make passage into a river or channel safer. \n\nTides PRO goes further than the tables provided by the NOAA. The app automatically accounts for correction factors and provides instant information without requesting that you account for time lags, daylight savings conventions, or height differences between the reference stations and the locations you are seeking. \n\nSince the tidal information that is published in this app is not subjected to the use of the voyage, please do not use for navigation."

To achieve the best results consider the following:\n1)  Easy calibration (only the first time): click on the calibration button (for details read the user guide accessible from the calibration page)\n2) avoid measurement in presence of loud noises (heavy traffic, motorbikes, trucks, loud talking, shots)\n3) keep your fingers away from the microphone and keep it in a vertical position\n4) orient the front of the iphone in the direction of the wind without interfering with your body\n5) click on one of the function buttons (Dynamic, Average, Spectrum)\n6) A click on the PLAY button starts the measurement\n7) A click on the RESET button clears the current measurement\n8) HINT: for long observation periods (> 1s) read the AVG value, for medium observation periods (1s) use the Average mode, for short observation periods (gusts) use the Dynamic mode.\n\nThis application is not meant to be used in place of scientific instrumentation, but with a good calibration it can come close to a real anemometer device.\n\nRead the embedded User Guide (reachable from any setting button): for any info or troubleshooting you can contact us at support@gaiacons.com."

With Sol, you can check times and get reminders of solar events, at home or while traveling! Great for everyone looking to plan activities based on sunlight. Use it to remind you to walk the dog before dark, get up with the sun, or find golden hour time for that perfect photo.\n\nSol: Sun Clock is the Swiss-army knife of sunlight tools with a design inspired by the simplicity of the sundial. Use it to plan your day, guide natural sleep cycles, get the best light for outdoor photography, make sure animals or kids are safe inside before dark, or to map out the best times to go running or fishing. \n\n* Be in tune: Sol will tell you when the golden hour is, how much sunlight you have left in the day or what time the next sunrise occurs.\n\n* Look to the future, travel around the world: Sol lets you find sunlight information for any date, anywhere on earth. \n \n* Find solar midnight and solar noon, and all three twilight (dawn and dusk) periods: astronomical twilight, nautical twilight, and civil twilight. Keep tabs on the next solstice and equinox.\n \n* Reminders and Alarms: Use Sol as a natural alarm clock that you can set to any event (like sunset, golden hour or solar noon), and the alarm or reminder time will adjust gradually as the days change with the seasons.\n \n* Automatic Location: Sol not only calculates the amount of daylight and sunrise and sunset times, but does so for any location in the world (both Northern and Southern hemispheres) by using your device's GPS... no network connection required. \n\n* Other locations: Optionally, use the built-in map to choose any location in the world by moving the pin, or search using the name of any city.\n \n* Optional location-aware alarms. Sol knows when you change with your location; and as you travel it will adjust any alarms you set relative to sunrise and sunset times.  Create alarms for multiple locations around the world.\n\n* Detailed almanac information: Useful information about the day's length, sun's azimuth and elevation, equinoxes and solstices, and a friendly glossary that explains all the terms. \n\nNote: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. However, GPS runs in the background ONLY if you have set location-aware alarms."

Use Radar HD to see what weather is coming your way!  \n\nRadar shows areas of current precipitation or future simulated radar prediction!. A weather radar is used to locate precipitation, calculate its motion, estimate its type (rain, snow, hail, etc.), and forecast its future position and intensity.  Precipitation type is indicated by the color. Green color indicates lesser precipitation while the yellow color code indicates intense precipitations. The color code red is indicative of the most intense precipitations. Blue color indicates snow.\n\nUsing the data from Storm Prediction Center and Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System (SPC & GDAC) Radar HD provides information about tropical storms and hurricanes for locations worldwide, areas affected by storms and severe weather, coordinates and wind speed, storm tracks & path projections.\n\nSatellite images provide an excellent view on the clouds in the sky and an indication of the weather over the United states, Europe, Japan, Australia and Indonesia.\nSatellite images come from satellites which remain above a fixed point on the Earth (i.e. they are “geostationary”). Lighter areas of cloud show where the cloud tops are cooler and therefore where weather features like fronts and shower clouds are.\n\nThe app also allows you to check the weather on your favorite places on maps. Interactive map includes live international weather conditions, local weather and time, ten-day forecasts and sunrise/sunset times for multiple places. You can add placemarks on the map to represent your favorite places or the places you’d like to visit.

While stressing about it constantly isn't necessarily helpful, the goal of the Breathable widget is to provide a quick, glanceable answer to a new daily question: Is it safe to go outside?\n\nBreathable can use AQI data from two services: IQAir.com and, optionally, AirNow.gov (in the USA). Both of these services offer free accounts and API access for personal use. Breathable uses the United States Air Quality Index for all values world-wide.\n\nAQI is based on latitude and longitude coordinates and Breathable makes it simple to find coordinates for any area using device's current location, or by selecting a place on the world map. You can also search by postal code, place name, or partial or full address. Coordinates are only used to request AQI data and are never shared with Karbon or any other third-parties.\n\nCustomize how your widgets look by changing fonts, showing or hiding various bits of information, or by using Breathable's Emoji Scale to soften the reality of the smoky air around you. Customize Emoji Scale using one of our provided sets or choose your own emoji for each scale value!\n\nSimply create your free API account, set your location, configure your widget, and add it to your device. Optionally, sync your API keys to iCloud to enable one-time API setup across all of your devices.\n\nWe wish Breathable didn't need to exist. Climate change is real and devastating, and we don't have much time left to stop it from becoming irreversible. Read. Get involved. Let's protect our planet and ourselves.\n\nRead more about how Breathable is trying to help make a difference in the global fight against climate change → breathable.app/impact"

This app is for you! Easy and intuitive, it shows you the times of the golden and the blue hours.\n\nDo you have to plan your own photo session or a trip? You can change your GPS location and date within the app so you know exactly when the best time is for your photos.\n\nFeatures:\n - easy user interface\n - multiple locations management\n - event reminder by notifications\n - customizable notifications alert\n - no data connection required (weather excluded)\n - iOS 13+ dark mode support\n - weather forecasts\n - moon phases\n\nIMPORTANT: No location data is stored outside the app or shared with third parties for tracking or advertising purposes.\n\nThe Golden hour, also known as magic hour corresponds to a special and sought after condition of natural sunlight with a high diffusion, warm temperature, low incidence and limited energy. In photography the golden hour translates into soft light, warm colors, shadows so long that they tend to disappear and a good level of contrast despite the reduced dynamics. Its opposite is the Blue hour that identifies a specific condition of the solar light characterized by a colder temperature and a low energy, which, in practical terms, results in subjects with numerous penumbra, de-saturated and colder colors and intense blue sky. The golden hour occurs when the sun is very low on the horizon and therefore in the moments after sunrise and before sunset, the blue hour instead at sunset or sunrise, in twilight situation, when the sun it's below the horizon. The time, duration and intensity of these \"magical hours\" change according to the seasons, latitudes and weather conditions and therefore this app will help you to identify them perfectly.\n\n2.8 - Feb 12, 2020\n- Following the suggestion of many users the use of gps is no longer mandatory and it is now possible to use the app without being automatic located.

This includes weather information like clear sky days, hourly angle of the sun throughout the year and more.\n\nIt doesn’t stop there, though. The app generates information on the size of system you’ll need and how many panels would be in it. It also calculates what the size a battery backup would have to be for a proposed system. The app also includes a guide and a glossary where users can get more information.\n\nBasically, it’s like having a solar engineer at your fingertips.\" --cleanenergyauthority.com\n******\nThis is an application for professionals of the photovoltaic/solar panel industry. PV Master is essential to any person in the field who needs relevant information always available. \nWeather you’re a construction company/panel installer or serious DIY enthusiast this app will satisfy all your needs and requirements when it comes to setting up a green energy system. The sun is the future and with this app you can make it happen yourself. \n\nThe application is divided into 5 sections: \nData \nHere you have all the indeces you will ever need * explicitly for your current coordinates * (such as number of clear sky days, insolation incident, hourly solar angle relative to horizon, battery sizing and deficits, frequency of near-overcast skies, frost days average, average wind direction and speed, average monthly precipitation and pressure and much much more). \n\nGuide \nIf you’re a DIY look for home improvement or simply “getting started” in this field, here you will find a general guide with the necessary steps and considerations to be made when setting up a photovoltaic panel system. \n\nPannel Calc \nThe most frequently asked questions we face when looking into the feasability of sun as energy is “how many panels will I need?”. Thanks to this app the big question is easily answered. Gather the data from the first section and your current electricity bills, input the values and you’re done. Then it’s up to you to decide weather you wish to do it or not... \n\nBattery Calc \nIf you’re serious about going green then you definitely have to account for everything. The sun is always there but we all know there are many variables that might disrupt our “fuel”. For this reason we need to also account for batteries and surplus storage to evoid wasting potential energy and also not be “stuck” when during the colder season. Again, just gather data, insert it in the easy fields and you’re down. You know everything about kind, capacity and quantity of batteries you need. \n\nGlossary \nThis is another great section essential for any starter (although even experts will surely learn something form it). A collection of A-Z terms related to this this topic. You can jump to a certain letter if you wish to find something out otherwise just scrolling through it to educate yourself is a great way of spending time. \n\nAdditional Info \nOn startup, the app requests your location and fetches the specific data for the entire first section. This is on actual coordinates, not just state or city...pinpoint! \nEvery successful data fetch gets stored locally (no need to worry about privacy) so that if the next time you open the app there is no internet connection (perhaps you’re “on-site”) you will still have the everything available."

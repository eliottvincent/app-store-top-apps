Kindle books you have purchased on Amazon will automatically appear in your app. Kindle Unlimited and Amazon Prime members can select and download Kindle books directly in the app.\n\nFIND YOUR NEXT GREAT READ\n• Read the books you buy on Amazon in the Kindle app. Choose from over six million Kindle books (including those with Audible narration), magazines, and comics and start reading in seconds. Explore Amazon Charts best sellers and titles across genres like romance, science fiction, children’s books, self-help, religion, nonfiction, and more—and try any book with a free sample straight from the Kindle app.\n\n• Kindle Unlimited members can enjoy unlimited reading and listening, with the freedom to explore over 1 million titles, thousands of audiobooks, and current magazines. \n\n• Over 1,000 books, magazines, comics, and more included with Amazon Prime.\n\n• Kindle Vella brings you stories released one short episode at a time.

Read comfortably day and night with adjustable brightness and background colors. Go to the Aa menu in your book to get started.\n\n• Look up words, people, and places while you read. Breeze through words you don’t know and characters you can’t remember with the built-in dictionary, X-Ray, Wikipedia lookup, instant translations, and search within your book. Simply tap and hold a word to view its definition, or use the Google and Wikipedia links to get more information.\n\n• Track your reading progress. See what percent of the book you’ve read, real page numbers (for most top titles), and how much time you have left in the chapter or book based on your actual reading speed. \n\n• Bookmark places you want to revisit, and make highlights and take notes throughout your book. Open My Notebook to see all your notes in the same place.\n\n• Hop, skim, and jump with Page Flip. Flip between pages or get a bird’s-eye view of your book with Page Flip—don’t worry, we’ll save your place.\n\n• Zoom in on high-definition color images in Kindle books, magazines, comics, and manga.\n\n• Sync your books across devices. When you’re reading a book, the Kindle app will automatically sync where you left off—along with any bookmarks, highlights, or notes—so you can start reading on one device and pick up where you left off on another.\n\n• When you can’t read, listen. Switch seamlessly from reading your Kindle book to listening to the Audible book, all within the Kindle app.\n\n• Get notified when authors you love have new releases.\n\nBy using this app, you agree to Amazon’s Conditions of Use (www.amazon.com/conditionsofuse) and Privacy Notice (www.amazon.com/privacy)."

I am not saying that 'Alif, Laam, Meem' (a combination of letters frequently mentioned in the Holy Quran) is a letter, rather I am saying that ‘Alif’ is a letter, ‘Laam’ is a letter and ‘Meem’ is a letter.” [At-Tirmithi] We hope this app will help you increase your recitation of the Quran and increase your blessings in this world and the hereafter. \n\n\nمن صناع Quran.com يأتي تطبيق القرآن للأجهزة المحمولة، تطبيق للمصحف ذو صفحات جميلة خالي تماما من الاعلانات.\n\nلقد أصبح من السهل قراءة القرآن بالشارع، وحفظه، والاستماع إلى قارئك المفضل.\n\nهذا هو مجرد بداية لتطبيق القرآن. سنعمل على تحديث التطبيق بشكل منتظم إن شاء الله، ونحب أن نسمع رأيك ومتطلبتك. يمكنك الوصول إلينا عن طريق البريد الإلكتروني ios@quran.com\n\nعَنْ ابْنِ مَسْعُودٍ قَالَ : قَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ { مَنْ قَرَأَ حَرْفًا مِنْ كِتَابِ اللَّهِ فَلَهُ حَسَنَةٌ وَالْحَسَنَةُ بِعَشْرِ أَمْثَالِهَا, لَا أَقُولُ الم حَرْفٌ, وَلَكِنْ أَلِفٌ حَرْفٌ, وَلَامٌ حَرْفٌ,وَمِيمٌ حَرْفٌ }. رَوَاهُ التِّرْمِذِيُّ. ونحن نأمل أن يساعدك هذا التطبيق على زيادة قراءتك للقرآن وزيادة حسناتك في الدنيا والآخرة."

      "label": "Unlike other techniques, you do not need to \"reprogram\" your brain with various Schulte tables, memory training, vocabulary development, memorizing numbers, etc. Reading speed increases due to the lack of eye movement and focusing of vision in one place. You will see how much you are absorbed in the content of the text, when you realize all the advantages of not having to move your eyes while reading in unnatural directions.\n\nThe speed reading technique, in our book reader Bookva, will help increase the speed reading technique from the standard 250 words per minute, the average person, to 600-700 words per minute, and even more.\n\nReading in Bookva should not create discomfort; if so, then you are using this technology incorrectly. Don't rush to speed up. You will understand when you need to read faster - when you feel that the current speed has become too slow for you. Your increasing speed is the perfect test of reading technique.\n\nThe key to space reading technique and speed is regular practice. Practice every day according to our speed reading method and you will see the first results in a week. Just remember that reading should be fun. And we will take care of \"feeding\" the words to your brain in the form in which it expects to see them.\n\nSupported book formats:\n- epub.\n\nFormats Coming Soon:\n- txt, FB2, RTF, PDF, DJVU, MOBI, AZW3, CBR, CBZ, CBT.\n\nDownload a reader to increase speed reading - Bookva.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.app-privacy-policy.com/live.php?token=BHGpgjxohI3M8jzvtkteI0bNFCI9haax\n\nTerms of use: https://www.app-privacy-policy.com/live.php?token=5gAD833X4nHh7g1vOIEGgVDsQMq10ZJ9"

First printed by the King's Printer Robert Barker, this was the third translation into English to be approved by the English Church authorities. The first was the Great Bible commissioned in the reign of King Henry VIII, and the second was the Bishops' Bible of 1568. In January 1604, King James I convened the Hampton Court Conference where a new English version was conceived in response to the perceived problems of the earlier translations as detected by the Puritans, a faction within the Church of England.\nJames gave the translators instructions intended to guarantee that the new version would conform to the ecclesiology and reflect the episcopal structure of the Church of England and its belief in an ordained clergy. The translation was done by 47 scholars, all of whom were members of the Church of England. In common with most other translations of the period, the New Testament was translated from Greek, the Old Testament was translated from Hebrew text, while the Apocrypha were translated from the Greek and Latin. In the Book of Common Prayer (1662), the text of the Authorized Version replaced the text of the Great Bible – for Epistle and Gospel readings – and as such was authorized by Act of Parliament. By the first half of the 18th century, the Authorized Version was effectively unchallenged as the English translation used in Anglican and Protestant churches. Over the course of the 18th century, the Authorized Version supplanted the Latin Vulgate as the standard version of scripture for English speaking scholars. Today, the most used edition of the King James Bible, and often identified as plainly the King James Version, especially in the United States, closely follows the standard text of 1769, edited by Benjamin Blayney at Oxford."

      "label": "Bible en français Louis Segond (Traduction King James Version - KJV) Ancien Testament et du Nouveau Testament.\nAussi je vous recommande \"Concordance Biblique\" - vous trouver dans mes applications.\nAprès la mort de Segond, la Société biblique britannique et étrangère révise la traduction, en 1910, en choisissant d'autres termes doctrinaux plus conformes à la pensée protestante orthodoxe (par exemple : « sacrificateurs » à la place de « prêtres », « foi » à la place de « fidélité »)6. Cette version 1910 deviendra la traduction protestante la plus lue au cours du xxe siècle.\nJusqu'au 19ème siècle, le protestantisme francophone a pour l'essentiel utilisé la traduction de la Bible réalisée par Olivétan, un cousin de Jean Calvin.\nLa Compagnie des pasteurs de Genève demande au docteur en théologie Louis Segond de réaliser une nouvelle traduction. Celui-ci traduit les textes à partir de l'hébreu, de l'araméen et du grec, langues \"originelles\", et non plus d'après la Vulgate latine, comme cela se faisait jusqu'alors. L'Ancien Testament ne comprend pas les textes appelés deutérocanoniques par la tradition catholique.\nLa version Segond paraît en 1880. Elle connaîtra une très grande diffusion et sera adoptée par l'ensemble du protestantisme francophone. En 1910 parait le texte de la 3ème édition, remanié et révisé. Il laisse mieux apparaître la divinité de Jésus Christ, selon les textes originaux."

      "label": "\"Learning a language is hard. Studying a foreign language requires hundreds of hours in a time-starved world. Prismatext meets you where you are, and offers an effortless method for learning a language: recreational reading!\n\nUsing an innovative method called \"\"diglot weave,\"\" Prismatext books blend foreign words and phrases into classic literature for context-based language learning.\n\nAt the start of a Prismatext book, you'll be reading in English. Very shortly thereafter, you'll be reading in English and a little bit of your target language. Prismatext will begin replacing words and phrases with their translations—not too many, of course, but enough for you to notice. If you get stuck, give the words a tap to bring up their footnote: you'll find their meaning there, as well as a way to hear those same words spoken.\n\nThe more you read, the more new words you'll discover. Prismatext introduces new words incrementally, allowing you to grow your vocabulary gradually. As you go, you may find yourself using the footnotes less and less. You'll be introduced to—and learn—hundreds of new words and phrases. By the end of the book, you may not even need the footnotes. And if you do, that's fine. Every great journey needs footnotes.\n\n==========\n\nPRISMATEXT WORKS\n• Numerous peer-reviewed studies from around the world agree: diglot weave is one of the most effective learning methods for foreign language vocabulary retention\n• Beginners welcome! The Prismatext experience is seamless and effortless\n\n==========\n\nLEARN 15 LANGUAGES\nArabic, Chinese (simplified), Dutch, French, German, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swedish\n\nYOUR PACE\nRead at exactly the same speed you would a standard book\n\nUSEFUL VOCABULARY\nPrismatext analyzes each book individually, and selects useful words and phrases from each one\n\nHEAR IT SPOKEN\nIn-app audio pronunciations keep you from guessing how words sound\n\nSAVE IMPORTANT WORDS\nHang on to notable translations and their context in the book, or share them with friends\n\nREGULAR UPDATES\nPrismatext books improve with time. Your bookshelf can only get better!\n\nOFFLINE READING\nOnce a book is downloaded, it can be read offline.\n\n==========\n\nYou will need to purchase books from the Prismatext bookstore.\""

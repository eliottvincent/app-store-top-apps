Now, operating in South Africa, Namibia and Botswana, Infinity rewards customers with CashBack on designated products at multiple stores. We believe this is the future of loyalty rewards because customers want a simple, easy to understand reward and program with options of where to earn and spend rewards. Loyalty program members are increasingly looking for their programs to show up where they happen to be, not the other way around. \nThe customer experience is also improved by a seamless process of registration, collection and redemption of rewards. Good customer service backed by sound technology will help to smooth this process. \nIncorporating this simple rewards process with added features like integrated competitions, gift cards, bank your change and discount to cardholders only, Infinity stands out above the rest as the all in one rewards card."

The dynamic between the “normal” web-based version of Shopify, and the mobile app, is amazing, with little to no changes (Except the size being scaled down of course.)“\n(Source: https://ecommercenewshq.com/the-complete-shopify-mobile-app-review/)\n\nReview from David B via g2.com\n“Shopify [..] allows me to do important things for my store from anywhere. That is because it gives me advantages in managing the store from a mobile device.”\n(Source: https://www.g2.com/products/shopify/reviews/shopify-review-2822877)\n\nABOUT SHOPIFY\nShopify’s ecommerce app can keep your business moving quickly.

Now, operating in South Africa, Namibia and Botswana, Infinity rewards customers with CashBack on designated products at multiple stores, including OK Stores. We believe this is the future of loyalty rewards because customers want a simple, easy to understand reward and program with options of where to earn and spend rewards. Loyalty program members are increasingly looking for their programs to show up where they happen to be, not the other way around. \nThe customer experience is also improved by a seamless process of registration, collection and redemption of rewards. Good customer service backed by sound technology will help to smooth this process. \nIncorporating this simple rewards process with added features like integrated competitions, gift cards, bank your change and discount to cardholders only, Infinity stands out above the rest as the all in one rewards card."

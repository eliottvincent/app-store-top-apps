The dynamic between the “normal” web-based version of Shopify, and the mobile app, is amazing, with little to no changes (Except the size being scaled down of course.)“\n(Source: https://ecommercenewshq.com/the-complete-shopify-mobile-app-review/)\n\nReview from David B via g2.com\n“Shopify [..] allows me to do important things for my store from anywhere. That is because it gives me advantages in managing the store from a mobile device.”\n(Source: https://www.g2.com/products/shopify/reviews/shopify-review-2822877)\n\nABOUT SHOPIFY\nShopify’s ecommerce app can keep your business moving quickly. In the fast-paced world of ecommerce, that speed can be the difference between a sale for you or for your competitor.  \n\nShopify has everything you need to start selling online, for any ecommerce business. Start your business today on the one platform with the ecommerce and point of sale features to start, run, and grow your business."

      "label": "The tenth edition of our biennial Valuation Methodology Survey, now available as a mobile app.\n\nOur survey continues to focus on the technical inputs required to perform valuations and provides valuable insights from our subject matter experts as they contribute to the collective data available to valuation practitioners in Africa.\n\nThis new tech-enabled delivery of the survey demonstrates our commitment to digital transformation, and we trust that the survey will continue to be of benefit to readers and contribute to the development of valuation practices across Africa, and globally.\n\nSubject areas include the Income Approach, Market Approach and Discounts and Premiums. Explore market insights ranging from risk-free rates, equity market risk premiums, small stock premiums, minority discounts, marketability discounts, control premiums and more. The app displays the results of the survey as interactive graphs and includes commentary provided by PwC.\n\nFeatures include:\n\n· News feed: Highlighting the latest PwC news and insights from our local and global experts.\n· Offline reference: Our in-app bookmarking and read later features allow you to tailor content and read it offline on your mobile device.\n· Search functionality for optimised and faster results: This feature allows you to quickly find what you are looking for.\n· Social integration: Register and login using single sign-on from your existing social media accounts.\n\nSneak peek:\n\nDid you know that the market risk premium is the single most debated input in a cost of capital calculation? We asked survey respondent what range of equity market risk premiums they applied when using the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) and the results are in. The market risk premium ranges from 4% to 15%, with the average used in South Africa ranging between 5.3% and 7.2%. Interestingly, a wider range was used by respondents than observed previously.\n\nTo discover more insights like the above, download the PwC Valuation Methodology Survey app."

We’ll even suggest frequented locations nearby, so you simply select the one you visited.\n - When returning to the same place the app automatically finds previous locations nearby - which saves you time.\n - Do you need to keep a mileage log for multiple vehicles or report mileage to more than one employer? No problem! You can easily split your trips and reports for different vehicles and workplaces.\n\n\n▶ 3. REPORT: Easily submit your tax compliant logbook\n\n - Your mileage documentation is ready when you are. You’re only one click away from detailed reports available on your phone or desktop. Download as a PDF or Excel file, ready to hand over to your employer or accountant at your convenience.\n - We create a complete, detailed report that can be given to your local tax authority (e.g. IRS) as documentation for reimbursement claims or tax deductions.\n - Do you need to log your car’s odometer? We’ve got you covered. You decide how often you log your odometer and we do all the math between trips. You can set the app to remind you daily, weekly or monthly.\n\n\n▶ COUNTRY SUPPORT & MILEAGE RATES\n\n - We primarily support the following countries: USA (IRS), Canada (CRA), Australia (ATO), United Kingdom (HMRC), Denmark, Sweden, and Finland. But our system is used in more than 50 countries.\n - Driversnote automatically calculates reimbursements based on the current mileage rates from your local tax authority (that we make sure to keep up-to-date).\n - You can set your own custom reimbursement rates or opt-out of calculating reimbursements altogether.\n\n\n▶ YOUR ONLINE ACCOUNT\n\n - All your data is secured on your online account and is always available even if you lose your phone.\n - You can easily manage everything from our website. From here you can access your trips, manage your locations etc. and print reports or download them as PDF or Excel.\n\n\n▶ AUTO TRACKING WITH IBEACON\n\n - Place a Driversnote iBeacon in your car and the app will automatically record all your trips in the background. You will never forget to log a trip again.\n - When you sign up for the annual basic subscription we’ll send you an iBeacon for free. \n - Your phone connects to the iBeacon when you enter the vehicle, and starts recording as you begin your drive. \n - The app stops recording when you exit your vehicle, and you’ll get a notification that the trip was logged.\n\n\n▶ SUPPORT\n\n - If you have questions or feedback please contact us at tel. (+45) 71 99 37 54 or support@driversnote.com.\n - We do use the GPS in the background when logging a trip, and continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\n\nHappy tracking!"

From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

First printed by the King's Printer Robert Barker, this was the third translation into English to be approved by the English Church authorities. The first was the Great Bible commissioned in the reign of King Henry VIII, and the second was the Bishops' Bible of 1568. In January 1604, King James I convened the Hampton Court Conference where a new English version was conceived in response to the perceived problems of the earlier translations as detected by the Puritans, a faction within the Church of England.\nJames gave the translators instructions intended to guarantee that the new version would conform to the ecclesiology and reflect the episcopal structure of the Church of England and its belief in an ordained clergy. The translation was done by 47 scholars, all of whom were members of the Church of England. In common with most other translations of the period, the New Testament was translated from Greek, the Old Testament was translated from Hebrew text, while the Apocrypha were translated from the Greek and Latin. In the Book of Common Prayer (1662), the text of the Authorized Version replaced the text of the Great Bible – for Epistle and Gospel readings – and as such was authorized by Act of Parliament. By the first half of the 18th century, the Authorized Version was effectively unchallenged as the English translation used in Anglican and Protestant churches. Over the course of the 18th century, the Authorized Version supplanted the Latin Vulgate as the standard version of scripture for English speaking scholars. Today, the most used edition of the King James Bible, and often identified as plainly the King James Version, especially in the United States, closely follows the standard text of 1769, edited by Benjamin Blayney at Oxford."

Edana is a new range of mobile and web-based applications that Ed-admin is migrating to, over the course of the next year.\n\nThis mobile application is an extension of Ed-admin, a browser-based software application that streamlines and simplifies education management, by integrating administrative, teaching and learning tasks into one user-friendly, custom-designed database that meets the needs of all educational establishments. Ed-admin was designed and developed by a core team of specialists in education, along with education managers and software developers, to provide a versatile system that is flexible and customised to develop with an institution’s growing needs, able to integrate into a corporate environment and suit a range of education establishments.\n\nVia the mobile application, you can view and edit information related to your classes, studentsâ€™ profiles, etc., and includes:  \n\t•\tClasses: list of subjects being taught in the current term or cycle, past and upcoming.\n\t•\tMarksbook: view the Gradebook, and enter marks.\n\t•\tAttendance: view and update attendance, both daily and by subject.\n\t•\tLearner Behaviour Management: enter relevant merits, demerits, notes, and observations for students you teach.\n\t•\tNews: access news items, information, and articles of interest that the institution deems pertinent to the well-being of the students.\n\t•\tNotifications: receive Mobile App Notifications from your institution, with easy access to past notifications, thereby being kept in the loop on events and activities happening at the institution.\n\t•\tDocumentation: access documentation published by your institution; \n\t•\tCalendar: view your daily schedule of classes, extra-curricular activities, and other institution events and \n\t•\tDirectory: view the contact information of other staff members and parents of students you teach.\n\nThis world-class mobile application is able to integrate seamlessly with the web version of Ed-admin and the Admin Portal, thereby ensuring that you have easy mobile access to the essential data you need.\n\nThe mobile application synchronises live with the institutionâ€™s web-based interface and updates the information in real-time, thus allowing for a truly mobile experience.\n\nBy releasing this powerful Staff Portal App, Ed-admin is thus living up to its name of being powerful and intuitive, and delivering an outstanding all-in-one system for educational institutions.

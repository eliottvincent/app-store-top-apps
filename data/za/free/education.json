First printed by the King's Printer Robert Barker, this was the third translation into English to be approved by the English Church authorities. The first was the Great Bible commissioned in the reign of King Henry VIII, and the second was the Bishops' Bible of 1568. In January 1604, King James I convened the Hampton Court Conference where a new English version was conceived in response to the perceived problems of the earlier translations as detected by the Puritans, a faction within the Church of England.\nJames gave the translators instructions intended to guarantee that the new version would conform to the ecclesiology and reflect the episcopal structure of the Church of England and its belief in an ordained clergy. The translation was done by 47 scholars, all of whom were members of the Church of England. In common with most other translations of the period, the New Testament was translated from Greek, the Old Testament was translated from Hebrew text, while the Apocrypha were translated from the Greek and Latin. In the Book of Common Prayer (1662), the text of the Authorized Version replaced the text of the Great Bible – for Epistle and Gospel readings – and as such was authorized by Act of Parliament. By the first half of the 18th century, the Authorized Version was effectively unchallenged as the English translation used in Anglican and Protestant churches. Over the course of the 18th century, the Authorized Version supplanted the Latin Vulgate as the standard version of scripture for English speaking scholars. Today, the most used edition of the King James Bible, and often identified as plainly the King James Version, especially in the United States, closely follows the standard text of 1769, edited by Benjamin Blayney at Oxford."

      "label": "Pl@ntNet is an application that allows you to identify plants simply by photographing them with your smartphone. Very useful when you don't have a botanist on hand!\n\nPl@ntNet is also a great citizen science project: all the plants you photograph are collected and analysed by scientists around the world to better understand the evolution of plant biodiversity and to better preserve it.\n\nPl@ntNet allows you to identify and better understand all kinds of plants living in nature: flowering plants, trees, grasses, conifers, ferns, vines, wild salads, cacti (and many more). \n\nPl@ntNet can also identify a large number of cultivated plants (in parks and gardens) but this is not its primary purpose. We especially need Pl@ntNet’s users to inventory the wild plants, those that you can observe in nature, but also those that grow on the sidewalks of cities or in the middle of your vegetable garden!\n\nThe more visual information you give to Pl@ntNet about the plant you are observing, the more accurate the identification will be. There are indeed many plants that look alike from afar and it is sometimes small details that distinguish two species of the same genus. \n\nFlowers, fruits and leaves are the most characteristic organs of a species and it is them that should be photographed first. But any other detail can be useful, such as thorns, buds or hair on the stem. A photograph of the whole plant is also very useful information, but it is often not sufficient to allow a reliable identification.\n\nAt present, Pl@ntNet makes it possible to recognize about 20,000 species. We are still a long way from the 360,000 species living on earth, but Pl@ntNet is getting richer every day thanks to the contributions of the most experienced users among you. \n\nDon't be afraid to contribute yourself! Your observation will be reviewed by the community and may one day join the photo gallery illustrating the species in the application.\n\nThe new version of Pl@ntNet released in January 2019 includes many improvements and new features:\n-The ability to filter recognized species by genus or family.\n-The differentiated data revision that gives more weight to users who have demonstrated the most skills (in particular the number of species observed, validated by the community).\n-The re-identification of shared observations, whether yours or those of other users of the application.\n-The multi-flora identification that allows you to search for the photographed plant in all the flora of the application and not only in the one you have selected. Very useful when you are not sure what flora to look for.\n-The selection of your favorite floras to access them more quickly.\n-The navigation at different taxonomic levels in image galleries.\n-The mapping of your observations.\n-Links to many factsheets.\n\nThe web version of the application is also available at the following address: https://identify.plantnet.org/"

      "label": "Learn Afrikaans with free lessons daily. Let Mondly teach you the Afrikaans language quickly and effectively. In just minutes you’ll start memorizing core Afrikaans words, form sentences, learn to speak Afrikaans phrases and take part in conversations. Fun Afrikaans lessons improve your vocabulary, grammar and pronunciation like no other language learning method. Beginner or advanced learner, traveler or business professional with a tight schedule? The app works great and dynamically adjusts to your needs.\n\nExplore language exercises for reading, listening, writing and speaking enhanced with a dictionary, verb conjugator and state-of-the-art speech recognition technology - you’ll feel like having your own Afrikaans language tutor in your pocket.\n\n▶ The secret path to language learning\nRemember the Afrikaans language classes in school? You started with hundreds of basic words and expressions, continued with tons of Afrikaans grammar lessons and at the end of a full semester’s language course you could barely translate a sentence or say “Hello!” to a foreigner. That’s the traditional way to learn a language.\nMondly has a different approach, that’s opposite to the average language course.\n\nHere are the key features that make Mondly a great tutor for you:\n\n• Crystal-clear audio and professional voice actors. Learn the right Afrikaans pronunciation from conversations between native speakers.\n\n• Useful phrases for real situations. Memorizing hundreds of isolated words is not the way to go when it comes to learning Afrikaans. Mondly teaches you Afrikaans vocabulary by offering you core words and phrases. The app breaks the learning process down into short lessons and puts them into themed packs.\n\n• Learn conversational Afrikaans. Conversation is the main reason to take this free course. It will help you build a core Afrikaans vocabulary with widely-used nouns and verbs, and speak Afrikaans clearly.\n\n• Verb conjugations. If you want to learn more during this course, just tap the Afrikaans verbs and get the full conjugation on the screen, including the translation. It’s faster and better than a dictionary.\n\n• Advanced Statistics. The App uses intelligent reporting, so you can always follow your progress. Build your vocabulary step by step and become better daily.\n\n• The Leaderboard. See how your friends are doing and compete with people from all over the world to become the best learner in the Mondly community family. Take the Weekly Quiz to become even better.\n\nBefore you know it, at the end of these Afrikaans lessons, you will master the most useful 5000 words and phrases and you will be on the fast lane to learning a new language.\n\nPLEASE NOTE\n\nYou will need a subscription in order to get access to all of this app’s courses and features.\n\nSubscription options:\n- One-monthly subscription for $US9.99 (or the equivalent in local currency), automatically renewed until canceled.\n- One-yearly subscription for $US47.99 (or the equivalent in local currency), automatically renewed until canceled.\n\nYour subscription will automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current payment period.\n\nYour iTunes account will be automatically charged at the same price for renewal within the 24-hour period prior to the end of the current payment period unless you change your subscription preferences in your Account Settings.\nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\nAny unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\nYou can manage your subscriptions through your Account Settings after purchase.\n\nWhen a subscription is canceled, access to the app’s courses and features will expire at the end of the current payment period.\n\nPrivacy Policy: www.mondly.com/privacy\nTerms: www.mondly.com/terms\n\nWe welcome your feedback and suggestions at: ios[at]mondly[dot]com"

      "label": "Manage your money easily with the free 22seven app from Old Mutual\n\nHere’s how it works:\n\n#1 - See all your money in one place.\nAll your accounts. All your transactions. All together. Link bank accounts, credit and store cards, investments, loans and rewards from over 120 South African financial institutions.\n\n#2 - Set budgets and we’ll help you stick to them.\nSee exactly how much you spend on what each month. Know what you‘ve already spent and have left to spend, and find more money. Activate spending alerts and we’ll let you know when you’re getting close to reaching your budget.\n\n#3 - Find relevant insights, regularly.\nNudges are hints and observations about your money. See things you didn’t know or hadn’t considered, and use your money better.\n\n#4 - We take security very seriously.\nMost importantly, 22seven is safe, secure, private and insured. We use the best security - the same measures as banks, governments and the military. The information you share is always encrypted and never seen by human eyes. Your info remains yours - always. So we won’t sell your data to third parties. That’s why over 580 000 South Africans use 22seven to boss their money.\n\n\nWant to know more? Keep reading:\n\n22seven (sometimes referred to as 227) is South Africa’s best budgeting app. We support over 120 financial institutions. This includes all major banks like Absa, Capitec, FNB, Nedbank, Standard Bank, TymeBank, Discovery Bank and more. The app is backed by Old Mutual - one of South Africa’s most trusted financial institutions.\n\n\nThe app lets you:\n\n#1 - View all your balances and transactions in one place so you can track them easily.\nOnce you link your accounts from over 120 South African companies, you’ll get to see all your money in one place for the first time. The app automatically sorts all your transactions into categories for you, like Groceries, Eating Out & Takeouts, Rent and more. So you can track exactly where you’re spending and find new ways to save.\n\n#2 - Create a budget to effectively manage your spending.\nThe app will create a budget for you based on your real, average spend. But if you want to challenge yourself to spend less, setting your own budget is easy. And when you’re done, activate spending alerts so we can let you know when you reach 50%, 80% and 100% of your budget so you don’t overspend.\n\n#3 - See how much you can safely spend each day.\nEvery day, 22seven will let you know how much you can safely spend while still sticking to your monthly budget. As you use the app, you’ll start to receive other ‘Nudges’ - little bits of information about how you’re spending and how your behaviour compares to other 22seven customers.\n\n\nHere are some other features:\n\n#1 - No more separate statements or slips.\nYour income and expense transactions are gathered and updated whenever you log in. You can also add notes, visualise or export your spending data at any time.\n\n#2 - Doing your tax return is made so much easier.\nAll your income and expenses are categorised and exportable to Excel. So you can also use your transactions in 22seven to rock your tax return.\n\n#3 - Get really good support from real, live people.\nOur support team, the Svens, are on hand to answer your questions from 8am to 8pm every day of the week via email and live chat."

Good driving earns fuel rewards - our clients can get up to R800 back every month.\n\nTo get your rewards, you need to install our tag device and make sure it’s linked to the Discovery Insure app. Then, activate your Vitalitydrive card by SMS or online at www.discovery.co.za, and always swipe it when you fill up at BP. You can also get rewarded for your Gautrain spend. Simply link your Gautrain Gold card at www.discovery.co.za.\n\nUse of the Discovery Insure app is limited to Discovery Insure clients who have installed the smartphone-enabled DQ-Track. Learn more about us.\n\nNote: The Discovery Insure app uses Location Services. When not driving, it does not use GPS. It uses battery-efficient methods to automatically determine the start of a trip, and stops detailed monitoring soon after a trip ends. The app is aware of your battery life and will not start monitoring a drive if the battery is low. Although the app has been designed to use the phone's sensors in a battery-efficient way, running the app without a charger on long trips may drain the battery.\n\nDiscovery Insure Ltd is an authorised financial services provider. Registration number 2009/011882/06. Limits, maximum fuel limits, terms and conditions apply. Speak to your financial adviser, go to www.discovery.co.za or call 0860 751 751 for more details."

Collective investments are traded at ruling prices and can engage in borrowing and scrip lending. Should the respective portfolio engage in scrip lending, the utility percentage and related counterparties can be viewed on the ETF Minimum Disclosure Document. The Manager does not provide any guarantee either with respect to the capital or the return of a portfolio. The index, the applicable tracking error and the portfolio performance relative to the index can be viewed on the ETF Minimum Disclosure Document and or on the Satrix website.\r\nPerformance is based on NAV to NAV calculations of the portfolio. Individual performance may differ to that of the portfolio as a result of initial fees, actual investment date, dividend withholding tax and income reinvestment date."

But, here we are, not just surviving but thriving. And, we’ve evolved from being king of price, to being king of insurance.\n\nIt’s a crown we wear with pride… Not just because of how many clients love our great cover and quirky ways. Not just because we keep introducing innovative insurance products. Not just because of our award-winning royal service (yup, we’ve won stuff). Mostly because, in 6 years, we’ve given R100 million in decreasing premiums back to our clients. We think that’s pretty special.\n\nWhat’s a decreasing premium\n\nThe name says it all: It’s a premium that decreases monthly instead of always going up. We figure, because your car’s value drops monthly, your car’s insurance premium should drop monthly too. It’s fair, it’s logical, and it makes sense!\n\nKing Price clients also get up to 20% off when they cover 2+cars… And their premium still decreases monthly.\n\nAnd, for every car that you comprehensively cover with us, you can choose to insure an Apple Watch, bicycle or set of golf clubs for just R1 monthly!\n\nWhat’s portable possessions cover\nPortable possessions cover will repair or replace possessions like clothing and cameras, tablets and travel luggage, and rings and sparkly things, if they’re stolen or damaged while they’re anywhere other than in your home.\n\nWe know it’s not polite to scratch around in other people’s handbags so we won’t ask you to list everything that you carry around in yours… We’ll cover these unspecified ‘everyday’ items up to an amount that you choose.\n\nBut, we do need you to specify some of your actual handbags, and a few other special portable possessions, and we’re apped to help you do this.\n\nWhat’s a car self-inspection\n\nWhen we insure a car for you, unless it’s brand-spanking-new off the dealership floor, we’ll need you to show us that the car actually exists. It’s not that we don’t trust you, we just like to keep our Is dotted and our Ts crossed. So, you can take it to an Autoboys branch to have it inspected, or you can DIY using our app. It’s super easy and quick, and we’ll guide you through it step by step.\n\nWhat’s this about donating my decrease\n\nThis is your chance to make the circle bigger and donate your monthly decrease to a charity.\nWe’re all about #MakingADifference and so we’re giving you the opportunity to support some of the charities that we support. You can choose to donate your monthly decrease to any 1 of 8 charities… Just tell us which 1 tugs on your heart-strings and we’ll take care of all the details."

Self-custodial means not even Bitcoin.com has access to your funds, and you can easily port your assets to another crypto wallet whenever you want. No lock-ins, and you'll never again ask for permission to use *your* money.\n\nDEFI READY\n\nConnect to Ethereum and Avalanche DApps via WalletConnect. That means you can earn interest on your crypto, trade using decentralized exchanges, participate in NFT marketplaces, access lending markets and much, much more.\n\nQUICK & SECURE ACCESS\n\nUnlock your Wallet app with biometrics or PIN.\n\nAUTOMATED BACKUP\n\nConveniently back up all your wallets to the cloud and decrypt them with a single master password. Replace the hassle of managing numerous secret phrases with the convenience and security of a single custom password. (You can still opt to manually manage your individual seed phrases).\n\nCUSTOMIZABLE FEES\n\nYou decide the network fee. Up the fee for faster network confirmations. Lower it when you're not in a rush. Bitcoin.com takes ZERO fees (you pay only to use the public blockchain networks).\n\nLOW-FEE CHAINS\n\nThe multichain [Bitcoin.com](http://Bitcoin.com) Wallet is committed to giving you access to low-fee public blockchains so that you can use peer-to-peer cash as it was intended AND make the most of the opportunities available in the web3 space. \n\nAVALANCHE SUPPORT\nNow you can buy, sell, swap, hold and manage AVAX, the native token of the Avalanche blockchain. \n\nSHARED WALLETS (MULTI-SIG)\n\nCreate multi-signature wallets to manage funds with your team or friends and family.\n\nWIDGETS\n\nInstall live market-data widgets on your home screen. Track BTC, BCH, ETH, AVAX and your favorite ERC-20 tokens throughout your day.\n\nMARKETS VIEW\nTrack the price action and get key info on the top cryptocurrencies.\n\nPERSONAL NOTES\n\nAdd text to your transactions to remind you who sent what, when, and where.\n\nSEND VIA SOCIAL\n\nFor BCH, thanks to low network fees and near-instant confirmation time, you can send a payment link (aka \"Sharable Link\") to anyone using any channel (eg. Messenger, SMS, email, Whatsapp, and so on.). Funds are received/claimed instantly with just one click.\n\nINSTANTPAY\n\nSet your spending threshold, then scan a QR code with the request amount set on the recipient's device. Your payment will complete in an instant (BCH only).\n\nDISCOVER\n\nUse the Discover section in the app to locate merchants near you who accept cryptocurrency payments in-store. Browse websites where you can checkout with crypto and find other cool features like games, gift cards, and more.\n\nCUSTOMIZABLE DISPLAY CURRENCY\n\nChoose your preferred display currency alongside your crypto (eg. USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, CAD, AUD, and more).\n\nORGANIZE YOUR HOLDINGS\n\nCreate any number of wallets to organize your funds as you see fit. Drag and drop to re-order your wallets, and hide wallet balances that you don't want prying eyes to see.\n\nAUDITED BY KUDELSKI SECURITY\n\nA comprehensive 2022 audit from the renowned cybersecurity experts proved there is no real-world scenario in which an attacker would be able to compromise a user’s private keys."

No forms, no fees, no minimum balance and no tax.\n\n• It's free •\nThere are no fees for Stash. This means every single cent that you contribute is invested to maximise your growth.\n\n• Invest on your terms •\nSimply link a bank card that can do online transactions and start investing straight away. You can increase, decrease and even pause your contributions at any time directly from the app.\n\nChoose to invest your stash into either our SA Top 40 Shares portfolio (variable growth), or our Cash+ portfolio (guaranteed growth), or invest into both. As these portfolios grow in value, so does your stash.\n\n •Challenge yourself •\nThe Ten Cents Challenge is a fun way to challenge yourself to start investing. Start with 10c on the first day and work your way up by adding 10c to your daily amount everyday for a year. Before you know it, all those 10c start meaning a lot.\n\n• Stash every day •\nEvery day, choose to invest from as little as R5 automagically. Want to invest more? Then stash some more with the tap of a button. Simple.\n\n• Stash on sunny days* •\nSave on sunny days for your rainy day. Every day, Stash checks the weather in your area. If it’s sunny, you stash spare change. If it’s un-sunny, you don’t.\n\n• Stash when you sweat^ •\nUse your workouts to help you become financially fit. Stash based on how many steps you take and calories you burn.\n\n• Boost your Stash •\nAdd up to R1,000 to your Stash at the end of each month.\n\n• Give you and your friends R10, on us •\nInvite a friend and you’ll get R10 when they sign up.

      "label": "Manage your money easily with the free 22seven app from Old Mutual\n\nHere’s how it works:\n\n#1 - See all your money in one place.\nAll your accounts. All your transactions. All together. Link bank accounts, credit and store cards, investments, loans and rewards from over 120 South African financial institutions.\n\n#2 - Set budgets and we’ll help you stick to them.\nSee exactly how much you spend on what each month. Know what you‘ve already spent and have left to spend, and find more money. Activate spending alerts and we’ll let you know when you’re getting close to reaching your budget.\n\n#3 - Find relevant insights, regularly.\nNudges are hints and observations about your money. See things you didn’t know or hadn’t considered, and use your money better.\n\n#4 - We take security very seriously.\nMost importantly, 22seven is safe, secure, private and insured. We use the best security - the same measures as banks, governments and the military. The information you share is always encrypted and never seen by human eyes. Your info remains yours - always. So we won’t sell your data to third parties. That’s why over 580 000 South Africans use 22seven to boss their money.\n\n\nWant to know more? Keep reading:\n\n22seven (sometimes referred to as 227) is South Africa’s best budgeting app. We support over 120 financial institutions. This includes all major banks like Absa, Capitec, FNB, Nedbank, Standard Bank, TymeBank, Discovery Bank and more. The app is backed by Old Mutual - one of South Africa’s most trusted financial institutions.\n\n\nThe app lets you:\n\n#1 - View all your balances and transactions in one place so you can track them easily.\nOnce you link your accounts from over 120 South African companies, you’ll get to see all your money in one place for the first time. The app automatically sorts all your transactions into categories for you, like Groceries, Eating Out & Takeouts, Rent and more. So you can track exactly where you’re spending and find new ways to save.\n\n#2 - Create a budget to effectively manage your spending.\nThe app will create a budget for you based on your real, average spend. But if you want to challenge yourself to spend less, setting your own budget is easy. And when you’re done, activate spending alerts so we can let you know when you reach 50%, 80% and 100% of your budget so you don’t overspend.\n\n#3 - See how much you can safely spend each day.\nEvery day, 22seven will let you know how much you can safely spend while still sticking to your monthly budget. As you use the app, you’ll start to receive other ‘Nudges’ - little bits of information about how you’re spending and how your behaviour compares to other 22seven customers.\n\n\nHere are some other features:\n\n#1 - No more separate statements or slips.\nYour income and expense transactions are gathered and updated whenever you log in. You can also add notes, visualise or export your spending data at any time.\n\n#2 - Doing your tax return is made so much easier.\nAll your income and expenses are categorised and exportable to Excel. So you can also use your transactions in 22seven to rock your tax return.\n\n#3 - Get really good support from real, live people.\nOur support team, the Svens, are on hand to answer your questions from 8am to 8pm every day of the week via email and live chat."

But, here we are, not just surviving but thriving. And, we’ve evolved from being king of price, to being king of insurance.\n\nIt’s a crown we wear with pride… Not just because of how many clients love our great cover and quirky ways. Not just because we keep introducing innovative insurance products. Not just because of our award-winning royal service (yup, we’ve won stuff). Mostly because, in 6 years, we’ve given R100 million in decreasing premiums back to our clients. We think that’s pretty special.\n\nWhat’s a decreasing premium\n\nThe name says it all: It’s a premium that decreases monthly instead of always going up. We figure, because your car’s value drops monthly, your car’s insurance premium should drop monthly too. It’s fair, it’s logical, and it makes sense!\n\nKing Price clients also get up to 20% off when they cover 2+cars… And their premium still decreases monthly.\n\nAnd, for every car that you comprehensively cover with us, you can choose to insure an Apple Watch, bicycle or set of golf clubs for just R1 monthly!\n\nWhat’s portable possessions cover\nPortable possessions cover will repair or replace possessions like clothing and cameras, tablets and travel luggage, and rings and sparkly things, if they’re stolen or damaged while they’re anywhere other than in your home.\n\nWe know it’s not polite to scratch around in other people’s handbags so we won’t ask you to list everything that you carry around in yours… We’ll cover these unspecified ‘everyday’ items up to an amount that you choose.\n\nBut, we do need you to specify some of your actual handbags, and a few other special portable possessions, and we’re apped to help you do this.\n\nWhat’s a car self-inspection\n\nWhen we insure a car for you, unless it’s brand-spanking-new off the dealership floor, we’ll need you to show us that the car actually exists. It’s not that we don’t trust you, we just like to keep our Is dotted and our Ts crossed. So, you can take it to an Autoboys branch to have it inspected, or you can DIY using our app. It’s super easy and quick, and we’ll guide you through it step by step.\n\nWhat’s this about donating my decrease\n\nThis is your chance to make the circle bigger and donate your monthly decrease to a charity.\nWe’re all about #MakingADifference and so we’re giving you the opportunity to support some of the charities that we support. You can choose to donate your monthly decrease to any 1 of 8 charities… Just tell us which 1 tugs on your heart-strings and we’ll take care of all the details."

      "label": "Millions of people have signed up for Bumble to start building valuable relationships, finding friends, and making empowered connections. And now, we’ve been named one of Apple’s 2021 Apps of the Year for connection.\nCreating new connections has never been easier. Bumble is working to lift the stigma of online dating by employing unprecedented standards for respectful behavior. Because of this relentless dedication, millions of people are using Bumble to build valuable relationships every single day.\n\nDATING, FRIENDS & NETWORKING\n\nBumble is at the forefront of matchmaking technology by providing an app that allows users to foster more than just romantic connections. The industry-leading app empowers users to swipe through potential connections across three different modes:\n\n- Bumble Date: On Bumble Date, women make the first move. We’ve changed the archaic rules of the dating game so that you can form meaningful relationships in a respectful way.\n\n- Bumble BFF: Life is better with friends. Whether you’re new to a city or looking to expand your circle, Bumble BFF is the easiest way to make new friends.\n\n- Bumble Bizz: Now we’re in business. Use Bumble Bizz to network, find mentors, and create new career opportunities.\n\n\nBumble is the first app of its kind to bring dating, friend-finding, and career-building into a single social networking platform.\n\nCHANGING THE RULES OF THE GAME\n\nAt Bumble, women make the first move. In heterosexual matches, the woman has 24 hours to make the first move and the man has 24 hours to respond. In same-sex matches, either person has 24 hours to make the first move, while the other individual has 24 hours to respond, or else, the connection expires. By prompting our users to be bold and make the first move we’ve seen over 3 billion messages sent to date.\n\nTHE BUZZ IS REAL\n\n“Bumble exists to empower women...” (Fast Company)\n“Bumble is just an app: but it’s changing the discussion.” (Wired)\n“Bumble offers an alternative that prioritises meaningful connections, with women calling the shots:” (UK Sunday Times)\n“Bumble rejects hate speech to make users feel safe on its dating app” (Texas Standard)\n“What makes Bumble different from other dating apps...is its focus on giving women all the power. ” (Business Insider)\n\n---\n\nBumble is free to download and use. However, we also offer optional subscription packages (Bumble Premium and Bumble Boost) and single or multiple-use paid services for which no subscription is required (including Spotlights and SuperSwipes).\nWe offer weekly, monthly, 3 month and 6 month subscriptions giving discounts to the weekly price. The prices may vary per country and are subject to change without notice. Prices are clearly displayed in the app.\n\n* Payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase.\n* Your subscription will automatically renew itself, unless auto-renewal is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.\n* Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.\n* You can manage your subscriptions and turn off auto-renewal by going to your Account Settings in the iTunes Store.\n* If offered, if you choose to use our free trial, any unused portion of the free trial period will be forfeited when you purchase a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n* If you don’t choose to purchase Bumble Boost, you can simply continue using and enjoying Bumble for free.\n\nYour personal data is securely stored on Bumble - be sure to read our privacy policy and terms and conditions:\nhttps://www.bumble.com/privacy\nhttps://www.bumble.com/terms\n\nBumble Inc. is the parent company of Bumble, along with Badoo and Fruitz"

Currently, 3 out of 4 times Hinge members want to go on a second date, we’re the #1 mobile-first dating app mentioned in the New York Times wedding section, and we’re the fastest growing dating app in the US, UK, Canada, and Australia.\n\nHOW WE GET YOU OFF HINGE\nIn today’s digital world, singles are so busy matching that they’re not actually connecting, in person, where it counts. Hinge is on a mission to change that. So we built an app that’s designed to be deleted.\n\n* We quickly learn your type. You’ll only be introduced to the best people for you.\n\n* We give you a sense of someone’s personality. You’ll get to know potential dates through their unique answers to prompts, and personal information like religion, height, and politics.\n\n* We make it easy to start a conversation. Every match begins by someone liking or commenting on a specific part of your profile.\n\n* We ask how your dates are going. After exchanging phone numbers with a Match, we’ll follow up to hear how your date went so we can make better recommendations in the future.\n\nThe app is free to use. Members looking to see who likes them or to set advanced preferences can upgrade to a Preferred Membership.\n\nTHE BUZZ ABOUT HINGE\n“Hinge’s CEO says a good dating app relies on vulnerability, not algorithms.” - Washington Post\n\"Hinge is the first dating app to actually measure real-world success\" - TechCrunch\n“A great option for those fed up with temporary love.” -TheNextWeb\n\nSUBSCRIPTION INFO\nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\nSubscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\nAccount will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period\nSubscriptions may be managed and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to Account Settings after purchase\n\nSupport: hello@hinge.co\nTerms of Service: https://hinge.co/terms.html\nPrivacy Policy: https://hinge.co/privacy.html\n\nAll photos are of models and used for illustrative purposes only."

      "label": "Location tracking app is a GPS tracker that helps you locate your family, kids, friends, loved ones, and people you care about in real time on a live, shared, and private map.  \n\nSmart Circles\nWith Smart Circles, you can create a circle of people who all share their locations within the group and can track each others location history and location in real time. Invite group members by sharing a unique, private 6-digit number. After the invitations are accepted, you can find people in your circle easily at any time.\n\nGeo-fence zones\nUse geozones to know which of your circle members are in a certain area the moment they arrive. Setting up is easy: first, drop a pin on the map to set the center of the geo-fence at a specific location. Next, name your geolocation, set the radius for it, and once it's created, you'll know when your circle members enter and exit it by getting push notifications. Geo zones automatically let you know where your loved ones are without any effort from them — for example, you can create a geo-fence at your children's school to tell you they've arrived safely, or create one around your home to alert you when a family member is about to arrive.\n\nEmergency SOS function\nIn trouble? By tapping on the SOS button, all members of your circles will get an urgent push notification that you need help, with a live update of where you are. You can feel secure in your life knowing your child, partner, or friend can alert you any time they are lost, in danger, or need help.\n\nOther features:\n- Find your family and friends on the mobile map in real time.\n- View location history of each circle member.\n- 'Find my device' by GPS phone tracker in case your device is lost.\n- Manage group circles and geo-fence zones.\n- More features are coming soon!\n\nLocation tracker is your handy GPS geo tracker and family locator app to keep your loved ones safe and secure. Subscribe to location finder for unlimited notifications, live tracking, longer location history and no ads. \n\nTerms of use: https://telegra.ph/Terms--Conditions--Find-Friends--Family-Location-04-06\nPrivacy policy: https://telegra.ph/Privacy-Policy--Find-Friends--Family-Location-04-06"

      "label": "I Am Sober is more than just a free sobriety counter app.\n\nAlong with tracking your sober days, it helps you build new habits and provides ongoing motivation by connecting you to a wide network of people all striving for the same goal: staying sober one day at a time.\n\nThrough our growing sober community you can learn from others and contribute by sharing insights and tactics that have worked for you.\n\n**The I Am Sober app features:**\n\n• Sober day tracker\nTo visualize how long you’ve been sober.\n\n• Remember why you quit\nAdd reasons and photos to help you remember why you want to quit your addiction and stay sober.\n\n• Daily pledge tracker\nTake a pledge every day. Sobriety is a 24-hour struggle, so start your day off by making a pledge to stay sober. Then you can review how your day went and log notes at the end of the day.\n\n• Sobriety calculator\nView how much money & time you’ve saved by being sober.\n\n• Analyze triggers\nRecap each day and find patterns that made your day easier or more challenging than the last.\n\n• Share your story\nEither with others or for yourself, take photos and journal your progress directly in the app. Then choose to share it or save it as a reminder for yourself.\n\n• Milestone tracker\nTrack and celebrate your milestones from 1 day, to 1 week, to 1 month and beyond. Compare experiences with others on their sober journey. Read how they felt at this milestone and what you can expect. If you’re struggling, share your story and invite others to offer help or advice.\n\n• Withdrawal timeline\nWhen you create an account and declare your addiction, you can instantly see a withdrawal timeline to get an idea of what to expect for your next few days (and weeks). What’s more, you can contribute to it. See how many others saw an increase in their restfulness vs those that saw an increase in anxiety. Prepare yourself for what’s to come in recovery.\n\n• Customize your experience\nYou set the time, your sober birthday, the category of motivation you need, the addictions you’re trying to break, even the end-of-day summaries. Make the app customized to your lifestyle and tailored to your needs.\n\n**Sober Plus subscriptions**\n\nI Am Sober is free to use, but you can support development of the app with a subscription to Sober Plus. With Sober Plus, you'll get access to these premium features:\n\n• Create a group\nStay accountable together and track your sobriety privately. Groups are great for complimenting your real-world group like Alcoholics Anonymous, NA, SA, SMART Recovery, or your rehab center.\n\n• Locked access\nKeep your trackers private with a lock that you can access via TouchID or FaceID.\n\n• Data Backups\nSave your progress in the cloud and restore your trackers if you get a new device.\n\n• More tracking\nTrack more addictions and get access to more communities. Even if your addiction is specific like Wine, Online Shopping, or Skin Picking, you’ll find a variety of communities of people who are all trying to get sober from alcohol, drugs, eating disorders, self-harm, and more.\n\nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. I Am Sober Plus automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and the cost of the renewal will be identified. Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nRead more about our terms and conditions here:\n\nTerms of service: https://iamsober.com/terms-of-service/\nPrivacy policy: https://iamsober.com/privacy-policy/"

You and the security company will know what happened.\n\nONE CLICK AND HELP IS ON THE WAY\nPress the panic button on the app, key fob, or keyboard in an emergency. Ajax will call a security company patrol dispatch or medical help and notify all system users about the danger.\n\nDETECTING FIRE AND CARBON MONOXIDE\nFire detectors notify of smoke and temperature spike and promptly alert about a dangerous carbon monoxide (CO) concentration with no color, smell, or taste. The built-in sirens will wake up even those who are fast asleep.\n\nINFORMING ABOUT FLOODING\nThe detectors notify of a pipe break, a washing machine leak, or an overflowing bathtub. The system will inform users, while scenarios with relays automatically turn off the water. And if the upstairs neighbors flood your apartment, you will get the app notification. \n\nVIDEO CAMERA IN THE SMARTPHONE \nWatch video from security cameras directly in the app. Connecting the Dahua, Uniview, Hikvision, and Safire cameras and DVRs takes a minute. Equipment from other manufacturers is connected via an RTSP link.\n\nSMART HOME\nChange security modes up to a schedule, program the outdoor lighting to turn on when strangers are detected on your property, or implement an anti-flood system.

The account is protected by session control and two-factor authentication. Ajax has been rated Grade 2 by five independent labs.\n\nCONNECTING TO THE SECURITY COMPANY MONITORING STATION\n3,500 security companies in 130 countries work with the Ajax security systems.\n\n• • •\n\nAjax equipment is required to work with the app. You can buy the devices from authorized Ajax partners in your region.\n\nLearn more: www.ajax.systems\n\nHave any questions?

If a vehicle alarm has been tripped, you can turn it off via the app. The Geofencing service sends you a notification as soon as the vehicle enters or leaves an area defined by you. In addition, you can configure Speedfencing and Valet Protect in the app, and receive push notifications in the event of their violations.\n\nFUEL-SAVING DRIVING: The Mercedes me App shows you your vehicle's individual fuel consumption.

The range of functions depends on the particular vehicle equipment and your booked services. Your authorised Mercedes-Benz dealer will be happy to advise you. Use requires an active, free-of-charge Mercedes me account. The functions can be restricted temporarily if there is insufficient data transmission bandwidth. Continuous use of the GPS function in the background may shorten your battery life."

      "label": "Finding a home in the Middle East has never been easier than with Property Finder. Whether you're buying or renting, you want a villa or a flat, we have it all.\n\nProperty Finder searches properties throughout the UAE, Bahrain, Qatar, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia and includes English and Arabic support. With homes and real estate, including apartments, penthouses, townhouses, and more, as well as plots of land and even offices, we'll help you find exactly what you're looking for. And when you do, Property Finder puts you in contact with the agent via phone, SMS, email, or WhatsApp.\n\nDon't see what you're looking for? No problem! Take the stress out of searching by letting Property Finder do it for you. Saved searches remember your requirements and will notify you when a property that matches them becomes available for sale — we'll make sure you never miss that perfect property again.\n\nProperty Finder is full of features that are designed to take the hassle out of finding a property — whether that's a new house or somewhere to start a business. Some of those features include:\n\n• Filters that make it easier to weed out the properties that don't meet your needs while highlighting those that do. Filters include the number of bedrooms, price, location, and much more.\n• Saved searches that take criteria from your filtered searches and save them for future use — and we'll even send you a notification when a property matching your needs is listed.\n• Digital tours mean you don't need to leave your home to find a new one. If an agent has provided a digital tour, we'll show it to you in Property Finder.\n• Price trends and building reviews ensure you have the information you need before committing to a property. We'll show you how a home or office compares to the rest of the market while telling you how other residents feel about the building.\n• Floor plans & 360-degree views give you a full picture of the property you're considering.\n• Quick and easy ways to get the ball rolling. See a property you like? Get in touch with the agent directly via phone, SMS, WhatsApp, or email without hunting for their contact details online.\n\nAnd that's just the start! You can learn more about Property Finder at https://www.propertyfinder.ae/ and download the app for free. You've never been closer to the property of your dreams!\n\nFollow us on Facebook (https://www.fb.com/propertyfinderuae), Twitter (https://twitter.com/propertyfinder), Instagram (https://www.instagram.com/propertyfinder) or drop us a line over at apps@propertyfinder.ae and tell us what you think about our app."

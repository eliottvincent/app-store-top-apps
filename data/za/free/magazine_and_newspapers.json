Ena od temeljnih odlik revije je, da je namenjena prav vsem. Članki so namreč napisani v poljudnem jeziku in tako dostopni bralcem najrazličnejših poklicev in starosti. Predvsem pa je to revija za vse, ki jim niso dovolj suhoparne informacije, ampak preprosto želijo več.\n\nStopite torej z nami v svet revije NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC - revije za vse, ki se želite učiti, širiti svoja obzorja, odkrivati čudežni svet rastlin in živali, spoznavati daljne in neznane kraje, ljudi in običaje, pa tudi Slovenijo. In kar v reviji najbolj navdušuje, so gotovo vrhunske fotografije, ki pripovedujejo zgodbe, kakor jih je videl objektiv priznanih fotografov z vsega sveta."

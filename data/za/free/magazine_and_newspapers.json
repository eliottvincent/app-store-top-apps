      "label": "A.R.T.S.Y Magazine is here to tell the stories of all the kids and young adults who are finding new ways to be successful in unconventional formats. We bring attention to all of the members of the counter-culture who are building their companies in ways that until recently did not exist.\n\nA.R.T.S.Y sheds light on up and coming musicians, underground artists, and up and coming fashion designers. We give these people a stage to reach a wider audience, but we also provide our readers with knowledge that no one else is documenting yet. We are doing this by publishing in-depth articles on the brands and the companies that these young entrepreneurs are building, and examining new trends and phenomena in insightful and thought provoking ways.\n\nWe live in a time where people are becoming rich, famous, and more importantly; successful over night. They are achieving greatness without the assistance of record labels, art agents, or talent scouts. These young and ambitious artists, musicians, and designers are taking their talents straight to their audience through the internet, and we are here to tell their stories. It is a time unlike any other before. The old way of doing things is fading, and when future generations look back at how these young entrepreneurs built their success and laid the groundwork for their own entertainers and designers, they will look back at A.R.T.S.Y to gain an understanding of the history that today’s youth is making. These are the stories about the people who are breaking the rules and finding success.\n\nThat is our story too. We are a young publication, fighting fiercely for attention in a market that is saturated with non-sense. But in that is where our advantage lays, we will stand out by providing our readers with intellectual but rebellious stories. We are a legitimate source of information about the things you want to know about. Our responsibility is huge, and we will do our part to make sure we meet the challenge that we have been presented with. We are more than just a magazine after all, we are historians.\n\n==================================\nThe magazine offers a yearly (2.69€/2.99$) auto-renewable subscription \n- Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase \n- Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period \n- Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase\n\n==================================\nThis magazine is proudly powered by PressPad.

Here is your opportunity to find out why!\n\nThe iPad/iPhone edition brings you selected pages from the latest issue as soon as it is available. You can subscribe within the application for full access, which brings you every page of the issue and a searchable archive back to 12th January 2012. Issues are not sold individually - for the duration of your subscription you have access to every issue in this archive.\n\nDuring your subscription you can sync back issues to your device. These will remain in place if your subscription expires, unless your device removes them (for example when running low on disk space). Re-downloading issues requires a current subscription.\n\n• Swipe or tap the page edges to flip to next/previous page.\n• Use the animated thumbnail view to flick through the pages.\n• Pinch or double-tap pages to zoom.\n• Switch between single or double-page view.\n• Search the current issue or the archive.\n• Tap any page links to web sites, email addresses, phone numbers or maps.\n• Tap contents-page links to jump to a particular article.\n• Sync back issues to your device for offline reading (requires wi-fi).\n• Network connection required otherwise.\n                                                                      \nWe recommend first running the app within a wi-fi area so it can sync the latest issue to your device - after that you can use it anywhere. Subscribers will receive new issues automatically via Newsstand.\n\nSubscriptions are available within the app at the following prices:\n\nMonthly £1.49\nAnnual £17.99\n\nIn addition, please note the following standard features of auto-renewable iTunes subscriptions:\n\n• Your payment will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\n• Subscriptions will renew automatically unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.\n• Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.\n• You can manage your subscriptions and turn off auto-renewal by going to your Account Settings in iTunes after purchase.\n• No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during active subscription period.\n\nYou can find our privacy policy here:\n\nhttp://www.exacteditions.com/about/privacy\n\nand our terms of service here:\n\nhttp://www.exacteditions.com/about/tos"

      "label": "Founded in 1999, The Chap takes a satirical look at the modern world through the eyes of an old-fashioned English gentleman. The Chap seeks to maintain decorum, standards and, above all, correct dress, and it goes about this by celebrating the great dandies and gentlemen of the past, as well as casting a critical eye over the rather disappointing dress habits of today. \n\nReaders are invited to send their photos in for a sartorial assessment and these are reproduced in the “Am I Chap?” section. Elsewhere, one may read interviews with notable living Chaps such as Chris Eubank, Sir Roger Moore, Adam Ant and Donald Sinden. \n\nThe principal gentlemanly pursuits are also given coverage: Gambling at the horses; Grooming (with particular emphasis on moustache cultivation); Cricket (written by Wisden regular Steve Pittard); Drinking (especially cocktails); Dressing Up (in which every sartorial detail, from waistcoats to slippers to pocket watches, is covered). The Chap also features an in-house butler, who is on hand to answer all your queries of a socio-sartorial nature. \n\nWhether you truly want to adopt the lifestyle of the dandy or the gentleman, or simply wish to keep yourself informed of the latest developments in cravat usage and pipe tobaccos, \nThe Chap is the only British publication entirely devoted to celebrating the arts of the gentleman. \n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nThis is a free app download.

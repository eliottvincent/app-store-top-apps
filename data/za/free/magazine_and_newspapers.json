Items that you have marked with \"Later\" will be stored in your article list for four weeks, even if you change your district selection.\n- Bookmark. A click on the bookmark symbol opens an additional list - the list of all permanently saved items. Only with the bookmark function, you can save an article in the MeinBezirk.at espresso App for a long time. \n- Change districts. You can change your selected districts at any time.\n\nThe MeinBezirk.at espresso App offers you a new and attractive channel next to the newspaper to consume current local news from Austria quickly and easily.\n\nNo matter if in Vienna, Lower Austria, Upper Austria, Styria, Tyrol, Carinthia, Salzburg, Vorarlberg or Burgenland - all news displayed in MeinBezirk.at espresso comes from meinbezirk.at, the online portal of Regionalmedien Austria.\n\nThe thought of the MeinBezirk.at espresso App makes your pulse beat faster?

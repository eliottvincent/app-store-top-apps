      "label": "Does the world need another OB-wheel-due-date-calculator app?  You bet!  OB Wheels combines three things that clinicians need to derive all the dates necessary in pregnancy care, and no other app has this combination.   \n\nIt contains a calendar calculator to determine EDD (EDC) from LMP or from a sonogram report.  The calendar calculator also provides gestational age (EGA) as of any date for a given EDD or LMP.  Because the calculator works off the real calendar, it is accurate for leap years too.\n\nThen for all of you who miss your cardboard OB wheel, the app contains one which you can rotate, pinch and zoom, and generally play with just like a regular cardboard wheel.  It's a little tricky to learn how to plant two fingers and rotate them rather than pinch-and-zoom to get rotation versus resizing.  But the wheel works and it is accurate, especially so because you can zoom in to be sure where the little date hash lines lie.\n\nFinally, the app notes the most recent committee opinion scheme from ACOG on how one might reconcile due dates from LMP and sonograms to arrive at a single final EDD.  To my knowledge, the scheme is authority-based and no better or worse than other schemes, but my practice and my learners need a single clear scheme, so this app includes one for easy reference.\n\nAs an educator and clinician myself, I am grateful for feedback.  Email me via the contact email at my website."

      "label": "Founded in 1968 by a French veterinarian, Virbac is an independent pharmaceutical laboratory present in more than 100 countries and ranked 7th worldwide. It offers a comprehensive and practical range of products and services covering the majority of species and pathologies. \nVirbac innovation, based on both technological advances and listening to the customers, relies on reactive production facilities which meet the highest international quality standards. For nearly 50 years, this has allowed the company to build a personalized relationship with veterinarians in every country. Through this privileged partnership, in which social, health and environmental issues come together, Virbac contributes, day after day, to shape the future of animal health. \nThe BackHome App embraces the company’s philosophy using the latest 21st century platforms to  provide services to its customers.\nThe BackHome app allows Veterinarians, Pet Owners and Welfare Organisations mobile access to the national database of registered microchips assuring pet owners that if their pets are lost, there is a national resource in place to help them be reunited with their pets as quickly and safely as possible. \nThe BackHome app allows users to look up microchip numbers should a lost pet be found to find the owner and to reunite the pet with its owner. The app enables Vets, Owners and Welfare Organisations to register pets on the national database and store contact information. Pet Owners can keep their pet information updated in an easy to use interface with some added features too. For example, if you are going on holiday, you can create temporary addresses. \nRegistering pets and keeping their information updated is one of the most important things people can do for the welfare of their pets. The BackHome app lets you do that – but it goes beyond that too allowing owners to store other pet information."

The application uses the date of the last period and shows the date of the next period, the best days to conceive a baby, the ovulation day and when you can avoid pregnancy.\n\n* Scientific Research *\n\nThe popular baby gender prediction method is used by default. But it’s based only on the widely-spread theory by Landrum Shettles. The application also supports the scientific baby gender prediction method. It’s based on the scientific research by Rodrigo Guerrero and the statistics of thousands of women.\n\nYou can change the gender prediction method on the “Settings” screen. But remember that either gender prediction method shows only slightly higher chances of conceiving a girl or a boy and it never guarantees the result.\n\n* Full Version *\n\nThis is the full version of the application. You will be able to see the following data:\n\n- The probability of getting pregnant on the current or on any selected day.\n- The probability of conceiving a girl or a boy using the selected gender prediction method.\n- Chances of getting pregnant during the current period.\n- Chances of conceiving a girl or a boy during the current period.\n\n* How to Use *\n\nTo generate the menstrual calendar you have to provide the following data:\n\n- The first day of the last cycle (select the day and use the button “Add”).\n- Average length of the menstrual cycle (adjust it on the “Settings” screen).\n- Length of the luteal phase (most women can use the default value).\n\nThe application works best for women with regular menstrual cycle. But average cycle length is also a good way to predict when the ovulation should happen."

Diastolic pressure tends to begin to rise at the same time but starts to fall earlier in mid-life, approximately age 55. Mean blood pressure rises from early adulthood, plateauing in mid-life, while pulse pressure rises quite markedly after the age of 40.\n\nConsequently, in many older people, systolic blood pressure often exceeds the normal adult range. The rise in pulse pressure with age is attributed to increased stiffness of the arteries.\n\nStay healthy!"

Make and receive referrals for more than 40 specialities, including Orthopaedics, Burns, General Surgery, Dermatology, Emergency Medicine and Ophthalmology. We offer a secure, HIPAA compliant, environment to help  healthcare workers in urban and rural spaces connect with specialist centres quickly and efficiently. We aim to strengthen the referral and communication networks that already exist, to save everyone time, and to help ensure that patients get the right care when they need it. \n\nFor specialists:\n\n- Get quality referrals with the clinical information you need to decide whether to see the patient or provide remote consultation advice in an async manner that works around your current work demands.\n- Send and receive images (images are compressed to reduce data usage).\n- Say when you’re on call or off duty.\n- Receive unique sound notification when a new referral comes in and attend to it when you’re not busy with a patient.\n- Engage with the referring healthcare worker through a private chat discussion to get more photos and general information.\n- Make a well-informed decision and filter patient transfers before they arrive.\n- Archive the case when you’ve seen the patient: remove the information off all phones and only keeps it on a secure server.\n\nFor primary healthcare workers:\n\n- Reach out to the on-call specialist for your area, in a structured and monitored safe environment to get the skill support you need for each patient you see\n- Save time! Referrals go to the person on call at your referral hospital, so you don’t need to phone around to find out who that is."

This easy-to-use and convenient format will further assist health care professionals in their implementation of the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®), thus improving the quality and effectiveness of care provided to patients with cancer. \n\nNCCN is a not-for-profit alliance of leading cancer centers devoted to patient care, research, and education. NCCN is dedicated to improving and facilitating quality, effective, efficient, and accessible cancer care so patients can live better lives. Through the leadership and expertise of clinical professionals at NCCN Member Institutions, NCCN develops resources that present valuable information to the numerous stakeholders in the health care delivery system. By defining and advancing high-quality cancer care, NCCN promotes the importance of continuous quality improvement and recognizes the significance of creating clinical practice guidelines appropriate for use by patients, clinicians, and other health care decision-makers around the world.\n\nOver the past 25 years, NCCN has developed an integrated suite of tools to improve the quality of cancer care. The NCCN Guidelines® document evidence-based, consensus-driven management to ensure that all patients receive preventive, diagnostic, treatment, and supportive services that are most likely to lead to optimal outcomes. \n\nThe NCCN Guidelines are a comprehensive set of guidelines detailing the sequential management decisions and interventions that apply to 97 percent of cancer cases in the United States. In addition, separate guidelines relate to major prevention and screening topics and another set of pathways focuses on the major supportive care areas. \n\nThe NCCN Guidelines provide recommendations based on the best evidence available at the time they are derived. Because new data are published continuously, it is essential that the NCCN Guidelines also be continuously updated and revised to reflect new data and new clinical information. The intent of the NCCN Guidelines is to assist in the decision-making process of individuals involved in cancer care—including physicians, nurses, pharmacists, payers, patients and their families—with the ultimate goal of improving patient care and outcomes. The NCCN Guidelines provide recommendations for appropriate care for most but not all patients; however, individual patient circumstances must be considered when applying these recommendations. \n\nVisit NCCN.org to learn more about the NCCN Guidelines as well as other NCCN Content."

This app will teach and reinforce an organized approach to identification of electrocardiogram rhythms. \n\nRecognition of ECG rhythms as the waveforms sweep across a monitor screen is a different skill than diagnosing cardiac rhythms on a static tracing. This app will improve your clinical skills more than reviewing with a book because you will learn to diagnose the rhythms as they dynamically move across the screen.\n\nThe app utilizes an organized four criteria approach to identify the rhythms. Then study the description of the rhythm to understand the electrophysiology. Use the same process to review all the ECG rhythms.\n\nThere are 80 ECG rhythms included in this app.\n\nWhen you feel you have mastered the rhythms in this program you should test yourself using the app Anesoft 'ACLS Rhythm Quiz'."

      "label": "Congratulations on your pregnancy! With this app we would like to give you a helpful tool, which will make food safety and good nutrition as simple as possible for you for the next nine months. What types of fish contain the least amount of mercury? Which types of cheese should you first strike off of your shopping list? And attending your next business lunch; what can you eat without worrying whether you’ll get toxoplasmosis? This app features a traffic light food labelling system of almost 1000 foodstuffs – they are categorized according to the level of danger to the unborn baby. Due to the background information and advice, you will feel more secure in the complex evaluation of the safety of unknown foods.\n\nHow the app works:\nAt first there is a theoretic part, which informs you in a nutshell about the most common foodborne diseases (toxoplasmosis, listeriosis, and salmonella.)\nThe core of the app is the food search. Here you can initially choose between an alphabetic or a filtered search. At first glance you can see whether a foodstuff is classified as green, orange or red.\nGreen-labelled food means that pregnant women can generally consume it safely - even if it is not necessarily healthy. Of course calories and nutritional value are another matter. On the same note, the permitted foods are always allowed in moderation. This applies especially to spices, herbs, and nuts. If you have a varied and balanced diet, you don't have to worry anymore. Orange let's you know that the safe consumption of the foodstuff depends on several factors (time of pregnancy, personal situation, the art of preparation, quantity, ...) But do not worry at first about the quantity of the orange entries, but do note the advice. Just click on the corresponding food label. You should absolutely avoid all red-labelled foodstuffs. They affect the development of your baby and damage it in the long-term.\n\nUsing the filtered search, however, you can adapt the list of the various risks and food categories to your individual situation. You can easily browse all accessible foods. Or you can filter through food categories and find out which cheese from your favorite camembert you can replace during the pregnancy.\n\nBy clicking the star you can finally add the desired food to your personal shopping list.\nBy the way, with the help of our hints and advice you will also get guidelines for specific food categories and several more ideas for everyday use. That way you can ensure even greater food safety without getting hysterical.\n\nWe wish you a relaxed pregnancy. All the best!\n\nKirstin & Roman"

While our partners enjoyed listening to our babies' sounds by placing their ears on the tummy, we wanted to capture and share these precious audio-memories ourselves. We tried voice memo apps and other sound-recording apps but felt that there was something more we could do to improve the quality of the sound in a simple setup. Fast forward a couple years and here we are!\n\nWhy should you try this app?\n- Minimum time to setup. All you need is your iPhone. Simple instructions are provided within the app and we are here to support you all the way.\n- High quality sound. Using advanced audio signal processing techniques, we deliver a high quality audio experience that allows you to distinguish your baby's heart sounds. For best results use AirPods.\n- Listen for free and only pay when you want to record and share.\n- Secure. All recordings are stored on your phone. We do not have any access to your recordings. You decide how you would like to share your recordings.\n\nFree version:\nWith the free version, listen to your baby's heart sounds unlimited number of times. When you are satisfied, you can purchase a premium version that allows you to record and share unlimited audio recordings of special moments and memories.\n\nOne time in-app purchase:\n- Features included in Free version.\n- Create unlimited audio recordings of special moments and memories. This feature requires a one time in app purchase. \n- Tag locations to remember and visualize where your chances are best for the next time you would like to hear your baby's heart sound.\n- When you would like to share the recording, multiple options are provided that include email, text and other social media apps. \n- Store the recording outside the app on your device or external storage apps.\n\nFor best results:\n- Use the app when you are 20-30 weeks or greater pregnant.\n- Use the app in a quiet room\n- Remove any phone case/shell/cover (the iPhone needs to touch your skin to be able to pick up the sounds)\n- Put the phone in Airplane Mode\n- Start the app and place the iPhone on your tummy to listen for a clear sound. You may need to try a few different spots. Press \"Record\" to create a recording\n- Use AirPods\n\nMy Baby Heart Sounds Disclaimer:\n- The My Baby Heart Sounds app is NOT a Medical Device or application.

You can also directly sync with the No.1 snoring tracking app - SnoreLab - to track your progress.\n\nOne of the main causes of snoring is weak muscles in the mouth area. SnoreGym is an exercise app which helps to tone your upper airway muscles to reduce snoring.\n\nSnoreGym will guide you through a set of clinically-proven exercises for your tongue, soft palate, cheeks and jaw.\n\nFeatures include:\n- Exercises to reduce snoring\n- Easy-to-follow animations\n- Clear and detailed instructions\n- Evidence-based workouts\n- Progress tracking\n- Sync to SnoreLab\n\nScientists have tested a set of mouth exercises which tone muscles in the tongue, soft palate, throat, cheeks and jaw. This research has shown that mouth exercises can reduce snoring, decrease the severity of sleep apnea, reduce disturbance of bed partners and produce better sleep and quality of life.\n\nIt is important to do these exercises regularly to reduce your snoring. We recommend at least 10 minutes a day for 8+ weeks.\n\nExercise now for quieter sleep!"

It has been created by practicing anaesthetists with an interest in teaching ultrasound and regional anaesthesia.\n\nAnSo:\n- provides multiple examples of the sonoanatomy as every individual is different,\n- provides landmark sketches useful for developing pattern recognition of landmark structures, and for trainees to draw in exams,\n- displays the cutaneous, motor, osseous and visceral innervation of the numerous nerve blocks and fascial plane blocks now available, facilitating appropriate block choice and knowledge of expected results,\n- allows combining and comparing block innervation,\n- allows images to be flipped to display both L and R sided orientation,\n- demonstrates functional ergonomics with patient, ultrasound screen and proceduralist positioning essential for efficient practical performance,\n- provides block notes with sonoanatomy tips and practical tips from experienced clinicians which can be invaluable to the learner.\n\nAnSo is not only for regional anaesthesia but includes many other perioperative uses of ultrasound relevant to the anaesthetist, such as:\n-      airway\n-      gastric antrum\n-      vascular access\n-      spine\n-      transthoracic echo\n-      lung signs\n\nAnSo contains:\n- over 250 ultrasound images with over 1500 sonoanatomy colour overlays,\n- innervation images,\n- ergonomic images,\n- landmarks pattern sketches,\n- loops when required for dynamic sonoanatomy,\n- notes with tips from experienced clinicians.\n\nAnSo helps identify not only the target structures but all the surrounding sonoanatomy. This more comprehensive understanding of the sonoanatomy helps detect anatomical variability, improves the safety and efficacy of procedures, and facilitates learning and teaching.\nAnSo has been designed in a format that can be easily updated and distributed to users so the information can be kept as current as possible in this rapidly expanding field.\nAnSo does not require an internet connection to run. Once downloaded all data is stored on your device so it will work anywhere and images will display without any delay.  It can be useful both in and out of theatre, when performing procedures, and when learning or teaching ultrasound. There is no advertising in the app making it pleasant and time efficient to use.\nTerms of use can be found at https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/\nDownload AnSo today and always have access to this sonoanatomy and nerve block resource."

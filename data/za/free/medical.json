The app will help to track your contractions and determine when it's time to go to the hospital.\nIf you plan on having a home birth, the app will tell you what stage of labor you are in at any given moment.\n\nKeep track of your labor by tapping a single button at the start and at the end of each contraction. The Contraction Timer analyzes the duration and frequency of contractions and will notify you when it's time to go to the hospital.\n\nThousands of pregnant women around the world have become mothers using our app.\n\nAlways consult your doctor to orient yourself in terms of contraction frequency and duration.\nThis app is not a medical device and our recomendations are based on standard indicators. Your labor may occur differently. Therefore, do not rely exclusively on our app.\nIf the duration and frequency of contractions do not yet correspond to the necessary indicators but labor pains become unbearable, it is better to go to the hospital as soon as possible rather than give birth at home or on the way there. Trust what your body is telling you.\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, please email us at neumandev@gmail.com. Your feedback is very important to us."

For measurement use, FDA-approved blood pressure monitors.\n\nApp Main Features:\n \n- Modern and user-friendly interface\n- High blood pressure control\n- Clear graphs\n- Measurement history\n- Reminders and notifications\n\nBlood Pressure Levels:\n\nNormal: Systolic 90-119 and Diastolic 60-79\nHypotension: Systolic 90 and less or Diastolic 60 and less\nElevated: Systolic 120-129 and Diastolic 60-80\nHypertension - Stage 1: Systolic 130-139 or Diastolic 80-90\nHypertension - Stage 2: Systolic 140-180 or Diastolic 90-120\nHypertensive: Systolic 180 and higher or Diastolic 120 and higher\n\nAging Adults:\n\nIn adults, systolic blood pressure rises from early adulthood onward, up to at least age 70. Diastolic pressure tends to begin to rise at the same time but starts to fall earlier in mid-life, approximately age 55. Mean blood pressure rises from early adulthood, plateauing in mid-life, while pulse pressure rises quite markedly after the age of 40.\n\nConsequently, in many older people, systolic blood pressure often exceeds the normal adult range. The rise in pulse pressure with age is attributed to increased stiffness of the arteries.\n\nStay healthy!"

It offers a comprehensive and practical range of products and services covering the majority of species and pathologies. \nVirbac innovation, based on both technological advances and listening to the customers, relies on reactive production facilities which meet the highest international quality standards. For nearly 50 years, this has allowed the company to build a personalized relationship with veterinarians in every country. Through this privileged partnership, in which social, health and environmental issues come together, Virbac contributes, day after day, to shape the future of animal health. \nThe BackHome App embraces the company’s philosophy using the latest 21st century platforms to  provide services to its customers.\nThe BackHome app allows Veterinarians, Pet Owners and Welfare Organisations mobile access to the national database of registered microchips assuring pet owners that if their pets are lost, there is a national resource in place to help them be reunited with their pets as quickly and safely as possible. \nThe BackHome app allows users to look up microchip numbers should a lost pet be found to find the owner and to reunite the pet with its owner. The app enables Vets, Owners and Welfare Organisations to register pets on the national database and store contact information. Pet Owners can keep their pet information updated in an easy to use interface with some added features too. For example, if you are going on holiday, you can create temporary addresses. \nRegistering pets and keeping their information updated is one of the most important things people can do for the welfare of their pets. The BackHome app lets you do that – but it goes beyond that too allowing owners to store other pet information."

But it’s based only on the widely-spread theory by Landrum Shettles. The application also supports the scientific baby gender prediction method. It’s based on the scientific research by Rodrigo Guerrero and the statistics of thousands of women.\n\nYou can change the gender prediction method on the “Settings” screen. But remember that either gender prediction method shows only slightly higher chances of conceiving a girl or a boy and it never guarantees the result.\n\n* Full Version *\n\nThis is the full version of the application. You will be able to see the following data:\n\n- The probability of getting pregnant on the current or on any selected day.\n- The probability of conceiving a girl or a boy using the selected gender prediction method.\n- Chances of getting pregnant during the current period.\n- Chances of conceiving a girl or a boy during the current period.\n\n* How to Use *\n\nTo generate the menstrual calendar you have to provide the following data:\n\n- The first day of the last cycle (select the day and use the button “Add”).\n- Average length of the menstrual cycle (adjust it on the “Settings” screen).\n- Length of the luteal phase (most women can use the default value).\n\nThe application works best for women with regular menstrual cycle. But average cycle length is also a good way to predict when the ovulation should happen."

OB Wheels combines three things that clinicians need to derive all the dates necessary in pregnancy care, and no other app has this combination.   \n\nIt contains a calendar calculator to determine EDD (EDC) from LMP or from a sonogram report.  The calendar calculator also provides gestational age (EGA) as of any date for a given EDD or LMP.  Because the calculator works off the real calendar, it is accurate for leap years too.\n\nThen for all of you who miss your cardboard OB wheel, the app contains one which you can rotate, pinch and zoom, and generally play with just like a regular cardboard wheel.  It's a little tricky to learn how to plant two fingers and rotate them rather than pinch-and-zoom to get rotation versus resizing.  But the wheel works and it is accurate, especially so because you can zoom in to be sure where the little date hash lines lie.\n\nFinally, the app notes the most recent committee opinion scheme from ACOG on how one might reconcile due dates from LMP and sonograms to arrive at a single final EDD.  To my knowledge, the scheme is authority-based and no better or worse than other schemes, but my practice and my learners need a single clear scheme, so this app includes one for easy reference.\n\nAs an educator and clinician myself, I am grateful for feedback.  Email me via the contact email at my website."

It has been created by practicing anaesthetists with an interest in teaching ultrasound and regional anaesthesia.\n\nAnSo:\n- provides multiple examples of the sonoanatomy as every individual is different,\n- provides landmark sketches useful for developing pattern recognition of landmark structures, and for trainees to draw in exams,\n- displays the cutaneous, motor, osseous and visceral innervation of the numerous nerve blocks and fascial plane blocks now available, facilitating appropriate block choice and knowledge of expected results,\n- allows combining and comparing block innervation,\n- allows images to be flipped to display both L and R sided orientation,\n- demonstrates functional ergonomics with patient, ultrasound screen and proceduralist positioning essential for efficient practical performance,\n- provides block notes with sonoanatomy tips and practical tips from experienced clinicians which can be invaluable to the learner.\n\nAnSo is not only for regional anaesthesia but includes many other perioperative uses of ultrasound relevant to the anaesthetist, such as:\n-      airway\n-      gastric antrum\n-      vascular access\n-      spine\n-      transthoracic echo\n-      lung signs\n\nAnSo contains:\n- over 250 ultrasound images with over 1500 sonoanatomy colour overlays,\n- innervation images,\n- ergonomic images,\n- landmarks pattern sketches,\n- loops when required for dynamic sonoanatomy,\n- notes with tips from experienced clinicians.\n\nAnSo helps identify not only the target structures but all the surrounding sonoanatomy. This more comprehensive understanding of the sonoanatomy helps detect anatomical variability, improves the safety and efficacy of procedures, and facilitates learning and teaching.\nAnSo has been designed in a format that can be easily updated and distributed to users so the information can be kept as current as possible in this rapidly expanding field.\nAnSo does not require an internet connection to run. Once downloaded all data is stored on your device so it will work anywhere and images will display without any delay.  It can be useful both in and out of theatre, when performing procedures, and when learning or teaching ultrasound. There is no advertising in the app making it pleasant and time efficient to use.\nTerms of use can be found at https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/\nDownload AnSo today and always have access to this sonoanatomy and nerve block resource."

Make and receive referrals for more than 40 specialities, including Orthopaedics, Burns, General Surgery, Dermatology, Emergency Medicine and Ophthalmology. We offer a secure, HIPAA compliant, environment to help  healthcare workers in urban and rural spaces connect with specialist centres quickly and efficiently. We aim to strengthen the referral and communication networks that already exist, to save everyone time, and to help ensure that patients get the right care when they need it. \n\nFor specialists:\n\n- Get quality referrals with the clinical information you need to decide whether to see the patient or provide remote consultation advice in an async manner that works around your current work demands.\n- Send and receive images (images are compressed to reduce data usage).\n- Say when you’re on call or off duty.\n- Receive unique sound notification when a new referral comes in and attend to it when you’re not busy with a patient.\n- Engage with the referring healthcare worker through a private chat discussion to get more photos and general information.\n- Make a well-informed decision and filter patient transfers before they arrive.\n- Archive the case when you’ve seen the patient: remove the information off all phones and only keeps it on a secure server.\n\nFor primary healthcare workers:\n\n- Reach out to the on-call specialist for your area, in a structured and monitored safe environment to get the skill support you need for each patient you see\n- Save time! Referrals go to the person on call at your referral hospital, so you don’t need to phone around to find out who that is."

      "label": "This application measures the distance covered within 6 minutes (\"6-minute walk test (6WT)\") using GPS coordinates. The 6WT should give an assessment of the objective functional impairment (OFI) of patients with degenerative spinal diseases, as many disease-specific factors (pain, muscle weakness, etc.) have an influence on the test result.\n\nThe aim of this test is to walk as long and as far as possible during 6 minutes without jogging or running. You can wear your normal shoes and use a walking aid if necessary. If you experience severe pain, leg weakness or gait instability during the test, you can slow down or stop and sit down. If you experience significant symptoms of your back condition, you should press the \"Flash\" button on the app's user interface (=Time/Distance To First Symptoms). However, if the symptoms allow it, you should continue walking as soon as possible until the 6 minutes are over.\n\nIn general, we recommend conducting the measurements at a place where no blockades of the GPS signal are to be expected (e.g. dirt road on an open field, neighborhood environment without high buildings), a relatively straight path can be walked (optimal: 500-700m) and your testing does not have to be interrupted for other reasons (e.g. car traffic, intersection with red traffic light). Please do not take measurements inside buildings or in a zigzag course.\n\nYou should generally not perform the test if you have a severe heart or lung disease or if your health is otherwise impaired. You should also stop the 6WT if the following symptoms occur: Chest pain, increasing shortness of breath, sweating and general malaise."

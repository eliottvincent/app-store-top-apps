For nearly 50 years, this has allowed the company to build a personalized relationship with veterinarians in every country. Through this privileged partnership, in which social, health and environmental issues come together, Virbac contributes, day after day, to shape the future of animal health. \nThe BackHome App embraces the company’s philosophy using the latest 21st century platforms to  provide services to its customers.\nThe BackHome app allows Veterinarians, Pet Owners and Welfare Organisations mobile access to the national database of registered microchips assuring pet owners that if their pets are lost, there is a national resource in place to help them be reunited with their pets as quickly and safely as possible. \nThe BackHome app allows users to look up microchip numbers should a lost pet be found to find the owner and to reunite the pet with its owner. The app enables Vets, Owners and Welfare Organisations to register pets on the national database and store contact information. Pet Owners can keep their pet information updated in an easy to use interface with some added features too. For example, if you are going on holiday, you can create temporary addresses. \nRegistering pets and keeping their information updated is one of the most important things people can do for the welfare of their pets. The BackHome app lets you do that – but it goes beyond that too allowing owners to store other pet information."

While our partners enjoyed listening to our babies' sounds by placing their ears on the tummy, we wanted to capture and share these precious audio-memories ourselves. We tried voice memo apps and other sound-recording apps but felt that there was something more we could do to improve the quality of the sound in a simple setup. Fast forward a couple years and here we are!\n\nWhy should you try this app?\n- Minimum time to setup. All you need is your iPhone. Simple instructions are provided within the app and we are here to support you all the way.\n- High quality sound. Using advanced audio signal processing techniques, we deliver a high quality audio experience that allows you to distinguish your baby's heart sounds. For best results use AirPods.\n- Listen for free and only pay when you want to record and share.\n- Secure. All recordings are stored on your phone. We do not have any access to your recordings. You decide how you would like to share your recordings.\n\nFree version:\nWith the free version, listen to your baby's heart sounds unlimited number of times. When you are satisfied, you can purchase a premium version that allows you to record and share unlimited audio recordings of special moments and memories.\n\nOne time in-app purchase:\n- Features included in Free version.\n- Create unlimited audio recordings of special moments and memories. This feature requires a one time in app purchase. \n- Tag locations to remember and visualize where your chances are best for the next time you would like to hear your baby's heart sound.\n- When you would like to share the recording, multiple options are provided that include email, text and other social media apps. \n- Store the recording outside the app on your device or external storage apps.\n\nFor best results:\n- Use the app when you are 20-30 weeks or greater pregnant.\n- Use the app in a quiet room\n- Remove any phone case/shell/cover (the iPhone needs to touch your skin to be able to pick up the sounds)\n- Put the phone in Airplane Mode\n- Start the app and place the iPhone on your tummy to listen for a clear sound. You may need to try a few different spots. Press \"Record\" to create a recording\n- Use AirPods\n\nMy Baby Heart Sounds Disclaimer:\n- The My Baby Heart Sounds app is NOT a Medical Device or application. It is NOT in any way suitable for medical opinion, advice or diagnosis, and it is NOT intended to provide any information about the person of use's wellbeing or health.\n- The app does NOT backup recordings automatically outside the user's device.

Diastolic pressure tends to begin to rise at the same time but starts to fall earlier in mid-life, approximately age 55. Mean blood pressure rises from early adulthood, plateauing in mid-life, while pulse pressure rises quite markedly after the age of 40.\n\nConsequently, in many older people, systolic blood pressure often exceeds the normal adult range. The rise in pulse pressure with age is attributed to increased stiffness of the arteries.\n\nStay healthy!"

      "label": "Does the world need another OB-wheel-due-date-calculator app?  You bet!  OB Wheels combines three things that clinicians need to derive all the dates necessary in pregnancy care, and no other app has this combination.   \n\nIt contains a calendar calculator to determine EDD (EDC) from LMP or from a sonogram report.  The calendar calculator also provides gestational age (EGA) as of any date for a given EDD or LMP.  Because the calculator works off the real calendar, it is accurate for leap years too.\n\nThen for all of you who miss your cardboard OB wheel, the app contains one which you can rotate, pinch and zoom, and generally play with just like a regular cardboard wheel.  It's a little tricky to learn how to plant two fingers and rotate them rather than pinch-and-zoom to get rotation versus resizing.  But the wheel works and it is accurate, especially so because you can zoom in to be sure where the little date hash lines lie.\n\nFinally, the app notes the most recent committee opinion scheme from ACOG on how one might reconcile due dates from LMP and sonograms to arrive at a single final EDD.  To my knowledge, the scheme is authority-based and no better or worse than other schemes, but my practice and my learners need a single clear scheme, so this app includes one for easy reference.\n\nAs an educator and clinician myself, I am grateful for feedback.  Email me via the contact email at my website."

It quickly became one of the most downloaded radiology apps, and consistently stayed in the Top Medical Apps section in numerous countries for all those years.\n\nWe have spent over a year completely rewriting the app, from the ground up. Radiology Assistant 2.0 provides a cleaner, faster and more efficient reading experience for all modern iOS devices. \n\nFor the technically interested: formerly Objective-C, the app is now 100% Swift\n\nBefore winning the \"Best Radiology Mobile App\" Award in 2018, the \"Radiology Assistant\" was a Minnies 2013 Finalist - Best Radiology Mobile App, nominated together with OsiriX HD!

If you purchase all Categories you pay the same as RA1.0. If you need less Categories, you pay less.\n\n\n\n▸▸  ABOUT YOUR SUBSCRIPTION\n\n+ All subscription options are for the duration of one year and can be cancelled at any time.\n+ Each subscription option gives you unlimited access to all Articles in one or more Categories.\n+ When you select a subscription option you can still cancel the purchase. If you confirm, the payment will be charged to your iTunes Account, just like any other App Store purchase.\n+ Your subscription automatically renews.

If you upgrade before your current subscription is over, you will be refunded the unused portion of your current subscription.\n+ You can find our Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy on the in-app About page, as well as on our website, at https://doRadiology.com/RA2Legal.pdf."

You can also read concise explanations of how each abnormality manifests itself in ECG findings. The ability to view these ECG recordings as often as desired makes this a valuable tool for mastering the nuances of ECG interpretation.\n\nCustomer reviews:\nThese apps have really been improving since recent updates. They are not designed as standalone tutorials, but rather serve as an excellent and extensive library of realistic example cases that illustrate principles of ECG interpretation, from the simplest to the very complex, and from the common to the very rare. Recent updates have expanded to include basic information on elements of ECG interpretation and cardiac physiology, which has added a new layer of depth to an already great collection of apps.

      "label": "[Caution] This app contains disease pictures that you may feel uncomfortable with, but it is just the best way for you to learn eponymous disease.\n\nIf you are a medical student, a medical provider or a nurse for any length of time, you will come across eponyms. Eponyms are diseases, disorders, procedures or equipment that is named for some person. For example, you will not be asking for a indwelling urinary catheter, you will be asking for a Foley catheter. When a patient went to the operating room for a pancreaticoduodenenectomy, modified or not, it was not called that, it was called a Whipple’s surgery. If a patient was at doctor’s and s/he said, your tests have come back, it would be unlikely for her to say you have an inflammatory B-cell lymphoma, rather she would say, you have Hodgkin’s disease.\n\nEponyms are a longstanding tradition in Western science and medicine. Being awarded an eponym is regarded as an honor: \"Eponymity, not anonymity, is the standard.\" The scientific and medical communities regard it as bad form to attempt to eponymise oneself.\n\nTo discuss something, it must have a name. At a time when medicine lacked tools to investigate underlying causes of many syndromes, the eponym was a convenient way to label a disease.\n\nSome diseases are named after the person who first described the condition—typically by publishing an article in a respected medical journal. Rarely, an eponymous disease is named after a patient, examples being Lou Gehrig's disease, Hartnup disease, and Mortimer's disease. There are at least two eponymous disorders which follow neither of these conventions: Fregoli delusion, and Munchausen syndrome."

Also, all Bluetooth data stored on your phone is automatically deleted after 25 days.\n\nTraceTogether helps us ensure that we don’t spread the virus to our loved ones unknowingly. It also helps us support the work of contact tracers and healthcare workers by combating the spread of COVID-19 together.\n\nApp functionality will cease once the outbreak ends.\n\nTraceTogether is designed for use by people in Singapore. To register, you will need a valid NRIC, FIN, or a valid document of your current stay in Singapore."

The Contraction Timer analyzes the duration and frequency of contractions and will notify you when it's time to go to the hospital.\n\nThousands of pregnant women around the world have become mothers using our app.\n\nAlways consult your doctor to orient yourself in terms of contraction frequency and duration.\nThis app is not a medical device and our recomendations are based on standard indicators. Your labor may occur differently. Therefore, do not rely exclusively on our app.\nIf the duration and frequency of contractions do not yet correspond to the necessary indicators but labor pains become unbearable, it is better to go to the hospital as soon as possible rather than give birth at home or on the way there.

For nearly 50 years, this has allowed the company to build a personalized relationship with veterinarians in every country. Through this privileged partnership, in which social, health and environmental issues come together, Virbac contributes, day after day, to shape the future of animal health. \nThe BackHome App embraces the company’s philosophy using the latest 21st century platforms to  provide services to its customers.\nThe BackHome app allows Veterinarians, Pet Owners and Welfare Organisations mobile access to the national database of registered microchips assuring pet owners that if their pets are lost, there is a national resource in place to help them be reunited with their pets as quickly and safely as possible. \nThe BackHome app allows users to look up microchip numbers should a lost pet be found to find the owner and to reunite the pet with its owner. The app enables Vets, Owners and Welfare Organisations to register pets on the national database and store contact information. Pet Owners can keep their pet information updated in an easy to use interface with some added features too. For example, if you are going on holiday, you can create temporary addresses. \nRegistering pets and keeping their information updated is one of the most important things people can do for the welfare of their pets. The BackHome app lets you do that – but it goes beyond that too allowing owners to store other pet information."

      "label": "My Baby Heart Sounds is a quick and easy way to use your iPhone to listen, record and share your baby's heart sounds.\n\nNot too long ago, we were pregnant mothers too. While our partners enjoyed listening to our babies' sounds by placing their ears on the tummy, we wanted to capture and share these precious audio-memories ourselves. We tried voice memo apps and other sound-recording apps but felt that there was something more we could do to improve the quality of the sound in a simple setup. Fast forward a couple years and here we are!\n\nWhy should you try this app?\n- Minimum time to setup. All you need is your iPhone. Simple instructions are provided within the app and we are here to support you all the way.\n- High quality sound. Using advanced audio signal processing techniques, we deliver a high quality audio experience that allows you to distinguish your baby's heart sounds. For best results use AirPods.\n- Listen for free and only pay when you want to record and share.\n- Secure. All recordings are stored on your phone. We do not have any access to your recordings. You decide how you would like to share your recordings.\n\nFree version:\nWith the free version, listen to your baby's heart sounds unlimited number of times. When you are satisfied, you can purchase a premium version that allows you to record and share unlimited audio recordings of special moments and memories.\n\nOne time in-app purchase:\n- Features included in Free version.\n- Create unlimited audio recordings of special moments and memories. This feature requires a one time in app purchase. \n- Tag locations to remember and visualize where your chances are best for the next time you would like to hear your baby's heart sound.\n- When you would like to share the recording, multiple options are provided that include email, text and other social media apps. \n- Store the recording outside the app on your device or external storage apps.\n\nFor best results:\n- Use the app when you are 20-30 weeks or greater pregnant.\n- Use the app in a quiet room\n- Remove any phone case/shell/cover (the iPhone needs to touch your skin to be able to pick up the sounds)\n- Put the phone in Airplane Mode\n- Start the app and place the iPhone on your tummy to listen for a clear sound. You may need to try a few different spots. Press \"Record\" to create a recording\n- Use AirPods\n\nMy Baby Heart Sounds Disclaimer:\n- The My Baby Heart Sounds app is NOT a Medical Device or application. It is NOT in any way suitable for medical opinion, advice or diagnosis, and it is NOT intended to provide any information about the person of use's wellbeing or health.\n- The app does NOT backup recordings automatically outside the user's device. It is the user's responsibility to regularly backup their recordings."

If you want, you can get to know the most important structures that can be demonstrated in ultrasound and then apply and deepen your knowledge in the ultrasound simulator. This will help you understand the growth of your own baby.\n\nScanBaby is divided into three different modes:\n\n-Scan mode: Here you can scan a baby all by yourself (not your own actual baby). Turn on labelling mode to see all the important structures colored. This way you can compare the ScanBaby image to your own ultrasound image and understand the shown structures better.\n\n-Learn mode: This beautifully crafted mode teaches you about the developmental stages of your child. Get to know all the changes that happen to you and your baby during pregnancy. We have included artfully crafted 3D scans of real babies that you can move around all by yourself and experience how your baby might currently look like. Of course all of these scans come with labelling as well.\n\n-Watch mode: Here we have included many different ultrasound videos you might actually see in a similar way during your own examination. All come with a short explanation what can be seen. Watch a baby dance inside the uterus, play with the umbilical cord and even react to the caressing of the father.\nTerms of use: https://scanbooster.com/index.php/impressum#qx-heading-1479"

      "label": "Does the world need another OB-wheel-due-date-calculator app?  You bet!  OB Wheels combines three things that clinicians need to derive all the dates necessary in pregnancy care, and no other app has this combination.   \n\nIt contains a calendar calculator to determine EDD (EDC) from LMP or from a sonogram report.  The calendar calculator also provides gestational age (EGA) as of any date for a given EDD or LMP.  Because the calculator works off the real calendar, it is accurate for leap years too.\n\nThen for all of you who miss your cardboard OB wheel, the app contains one which you can rotate, pinch and zoom, and generally play with just like a regular cardboard wheel.  It's a little tricky to learn how to plant two fingers and rotate them rather than pinch-and-zoom to get rotation versus resizing.  But the wheel works and it is accurate, especially so because you can zoom in to be sure where the little date hash lines lie.\n\nFinally, the app notes the most recent committee opinion scheme from ACOG on how one might reconcile due dates from LMP and sonograms to arrive at a single final EDD.  To my knowledge, the scheme is authority-based and no better or worse than other schemes, but my practice and my learners need a single clear scheme, so this app includes one for easy reference.\n\nAs an educator and clinician myself, I am grateful for feedback.  Email me via the contact email at my website."

Dexcom G6 is approved for children age 2 and older.\n\nThe Dexcom G6 System provides personalized trend alerts right on your smart device and lets you see when your glucose levels are going too low, or too high, so you can better manage your diabetes. The Alert Schedule feature lets you schedule and customize a second set of alerts.  Custom alert sounds are available, including a Vibrate-Only option on the phone for glucose alerts. The only exception is the Urgent Low Alarm, which you can’t turn off.\n\n\nThe Always Sound setting allows you to receive certain Dexcom CGM Alerts even if your phone sound is off, set to vibrate, or in Do Not Disturb mode. This will allow you to silence calls or texts but still receive audible CGM Urgent Low Alarm and alerts: Low and High Glucose alert, Urgent Low Soon, and Rise and Fall Rate.  Please note that when your phone is set to Silent or Do Not Disturb, you will not receive any audible alerts for Signal Loss.  Always Sound is on by default. A Home screen icon shows you if your Alerts will sound or not.  For safety, the Urgent Low alarm and these alerts can’t be silenced: Transmitter Failed, Sensor Failed, and App Stopped. \n\nIn addition to the accurate performance provided by the Dexcom Sensor, you’ll receive other valuable features:\n\n•\tShare your glucose data with your followers who can monitor your glucose data and trends on their compatible smart device with the Dexcom Follow app. Share and Follow functions require an internet connection\n•\tHealth app access so you can share retrospective glucose data with third party apps\n•\tToday View widget, which allows you to view your glucose data on the lock screen of your smart device\n•\tAsk Siri* to read your current glucose value, using a custom phrase\n•\tA Dexcom CLARITY link on the landscape trend graph lets you easily transition to the CLARITY App to view more information on your glucose trends\n\n*Siri may not be available in all regions.

      "label": "The Med Safety app is a free smart phone app for reporting suspected adverse effects (or adverse drug reactions) to National Competent Authorities. This simple tool lets you report adverse effects to medicines, keep track of previously reported information and receive official news and alerts about medicines you are taking or interested in. \n \nWhy use the app?\n \n• Quick and easy to report adverse effects\n• Instant access to medicines safety information\n• Help make medicines safer for all\n• It’s free!\n \nKey features of the app\n \n• Submit reports on adverse effects even while offline\n• View and submit updates to previously submitted reports\n• See immediate acceptance of your reports\n• Create a ‘watch list’ of medications to receive personalised news and alerts\n \nWhy does it matter?\n \nMedicines are developed to be as safe and effective as possible, but they can still cause side effects. It is important for people to report adverse effects to medicines as this information can be used to identify previously unknown issues with those medicines.\n \nAdverse effects sometimes stop patients from completing their treatment, which can lead to even more serious problems. Reporting adverse effects encourages a dialogue between patients and healthcare professionals and helps professionals to identify and investigate unknown or poorly described adverse effects.\n \nThe Med Safety app has been developed as part of the WEB-RADR project. WEB-RADR is supported by the Innovative Medicines Initiative Joint Undertaking (IMI JU) under grant agreement n° 115632, resources of which are composed of financial contribution from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) and EFPIA companies’ in kind contribution."

Raga, we all know is \nthe sequence of selected notes (swaras) that lend \nappropriate ‘mood’ or emotion in a selective combination. \nDepending on their nature, a raga could induce or \nintensify joy or sorrow, violence or peace and it is this \nquality which forms the basis for musical application. \nThus, a whole range of emotions and their nuances could \nbe captured and communicated within certain rhythms \nand melodies. Playing, performing and even listening to \nappropriate ragas can work as a medicine.(Bagchi, 2003) \nVarious ragas have since been recognized to have definite \nimpact on certain ailments. (Sairam, 2004)\n\nRagas of the Indian classical music (Shastric Music)\nare created according to the deep knowledge of \nharmonious consonance between the seven swaras and \nchakras. This is why shastric musical compositions are \nfound to have significant positive effect on the mind-body \nsystem and also have the potential to awaken the \notherwise dormant faculties.\nMobinet Innovations Pvt.

      "label": "Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) presents a difficult clinical problem, as it often occurs with little warning and requires a complex set of resuscitative actions to be instituted within minutes. Therefore, survival from cardiac arrest is poor, with out-of-hospital SCA survival to discharge generally reported at less than 10%, and survival from in-hospital SCA estimated at 18%.\n\nAdditionally, multiple errors are made during resuscitation of the patient with sudden cardiac arrest. Clinical simulation has been shown to improve the resuscitation outcomes of patients with SCA. However, clinical simulation is resource intensive, requiring a high faculty to learner ratio. Consequently, only a small number of healthcare personnel can undergo regular repeated training required for optimal outcomes.\nWith the use of 360-degree video, it may highlight common and fatal errors in a contextual manner where a constant stream of data are received, communicated and interpreted by a team of doctors, nurses and respiratory therapist. Hence there is a potential that 360-degree videos can improve the resuscitation of the patient with SCA when combined with simulation training. The utility of 360-degree videos could potentially facilitate the medical education and training of healthcare staff to deliver effective resuscitation for better patient outcomes."

Diastolic pressure tends to begin to rise at the same time but starts to fall earlier in mid-life, approximately age 55. Mean blood pressure rises from early adulthood, plateauing in mid-life, while pulse pressure rises quite markedly after the age of 40.\n\nConsequently, in many older people, systolic blood pressure often exceeds the normal adult range. The rise in pulse pressure with age is attributed to increased stiffness of the arteries.\n\nStay healthy!"

      "label": "Get a better idea of your general health and physical fitness level with the ECG Analyzer app + Apple Watch ECG. \nECG Analyzer integrates with Apple Health to unleash the greatest power of your Apple Watch ECG, by analyzing and calculating HRV out of your ECG data, one of the best metrics for physical fitness and overall health level.\n\nWith HRV trends you can learn your health level changes. A up hill trend means a better physical fitness level and a down hill indicates you should pay more attention to your overall health.\n\nThings you can do about your ECG data -\n1. Measure intervals and voltages on the ECG rhythm waves\n2. Calculate HRV (using RMSSD)\n3. View Poincaré plot / R-R interval plot\n4. HRV trends\n5. Generate PDF report with HRV info\n6. Send your ECG report to your healthcare provider\n\nSo what is HRV?\nHRV is a measure of your autonomic nervous system that is widely considered one of the best objective metrics for physical fitness and determining your body’s readiness to perform.\n\nAlthough HRV manifests as a function of your heart rate, it actually originates from your nervous system. Your autonomic nervous system, which controls the involuntary aspects of your physiology, has two branches, parasympathetic (deactivating) and sympathetic (activating).\n\nThe parasympathetic branch (often referred to as “rest and digest”) handles inputs from internal organs, like digestion or your fingernails and hair growing. It causes a decrease in heart rate.\n\nThe sympathetic branch (often called “fight or flight”) reflects responses to things like stress and exercise, and increases your heart rate.\n\nHeart rate variability comes from these two competing branches simultaneously sending signals to your heart. If your nervous system is balanced, your heart is constantly being told to beat slower by your parasympathetic system, and beat faster by your sympathetic system. This causes a fluctuation in your heart rate: HRV.\n\nTerms of use - http://www.apple.com/legal/itunes/appstore/dev/stdeula"

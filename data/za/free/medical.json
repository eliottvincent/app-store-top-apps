The app will help to track your contractions and determine when it's time to go to the hospital.\nIf you plan on having a home birth, the app will tell you what stage of labor you are in at any given moment.\n\nKeep track of your labor by tapping a single button at the start and at the end of each contraction. The Contraction Timer analyzes the duration and frequency of contractions and will notify you when it's time to go to the hospital.\n\nThousands of pregnant women around the world have become mothers using our app.\n\nAlways consult your doctor to orient yourself in terms of contraction frequency and duration.\nThis app is not a medical device and our recomendations are based on standard indicators. Your labor may occur differently. Therefore, do not rely exclusively on our app.\nIf the duration and frequency of contractions do not yet correspond to the necessary indicators but labor pains become unbearable, it is better to go to the hospital as soon as possible rather than give birth at home or on the way there. Trust what your body is telling you.\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, please email us at neumandev@gmail.com. Your feedback is very important to us."

To receive alarms on your phone, you must start the sensor with the app. To receive alarms on your FreeStyle Libre 2 reader, you must start the sensor with your reader. Once the sensor has been started with the reader, you can also scan that sensor with your phone.\r\n\r\nRemember that the app and reader do not share data with each other.

While our partners enjoyed listening to our babies' sounds by placing their ears on the tummy, we wanted to capture and share these precious audio-memories ourselves. We tried voice memo apps and other sound-recording apps but felt that there was something more we could do to improve the quality of the sound in a simple setup. Fast forward a couple years and here we are!\n\nWhy should you try this app?\n- Minimum time to setup. All you need is your iPhone. Simple instructions are provided within the app and we are here to support you all the way.\n- High quality sound. Using advanced audio signal processing techniques, we deliver a high quality audio experience that allows you to distinguish your baby's heart sounds. For best results use AirPods.\n- Listen for free and only pay when you want to record and share.\n- Secure. All recordings are stored on your phone. We do not have any access to your recordings. You decide how you would like to share your recordings.\n\nFree version:\nWith the free version, listen to your baby's heart sounds unlimited number of times. When you are satisfied, you can purchase a premium version that allows you to record and share unlimited audio recordings of special moments and memories.\n\nOne time in-app purchase:\n- Features included in Free version.\n- Create unlimited audio recordings of special moments and memories. This feature requires a one time in app purchase. \n- Tag locations to remember and visualize where your chances are best for the next time you would like to hear your baby's heart sound.\n- When you would like to share the recording, multiple options are provided that include email, text and other social media apps. \n- Store the recording outside the app on your device or external storage apps.\n\nFor best results:\n- Use the app when you are 20-30 weeks or greater pregnant.\n- Use the app in a quiet room\n- Remove any phone case/shell/cover (the iPhone needs to touch your skin to be able to pick up the sounds)\n- Put the phone in Airplane Mode\n- Start the app and place the iPhone on your tummy to listen for a clear sound. You may need to try a few different spots. Press \"Record\" to create a recording\n- Use AirPods\n\nMy Baby Heart Sounds Disclaimer:\n- The My Baby Heart Sounds app is NOT a Medical Device or application. It is NOT in any way suitable for medical opinion, advice or diagnosis, and it is NOT intended to provide any information about the person of use's wellbeing or health.\n- The app does NOT backup recordings automatically outside the user's device.

      "label": "Does the world need another OB-wheel-due-date-calculator app?  You bet!  OB Wheels combines three things that clinicians need to derive all the dates necessary in pregnancy care, and no other app has this combination.   \n\nIt contains a calendar calculator to determine EDD (EDC) from LMP or from a sonogram report.  The calendar calculator also provides gestational age (EGA) as of any date for a given EDD or LMP.  Because the calculator works off the real calendar, it is accurate for leap years too.\n\nThen for all of you who miss your cardboard OB wheel, the app contains one which you can rotate, pinch and zoom, and generally play with just like a regular cardboard wheel.  It's a little tricky to learn how to plant two fingers and rotate them rather than pinch-and-zoom to get rotation versus resizing.  But the wheel works and it is accurate, especially so because you can zoom in to be sure where the little date hash lines lie.\n\nFinally, the app notes the most recent committee opinion scheme from ACOG on how one might reconcile due dates from LMP and sonograms to arrive at a single final EDD.  To my knowledge, the scheme is authority-based and no better or worse than other schemes, but my practice and my learners need a single clear scheme, so this app includes one for easy reference.\n\nAs an educator and clinician myself, I am grateful for feedback.  Email me via the contact email at my website."

Mean blood pressure rises from early adulthood, plateauing in mid-life, while pulse pressure rises quite markedly after the age of 40.\n\nConsequently, in many older people, systolic blood pressure often exceeds the normal adult range. The rise in pulse pressure with age is attributed to increased stiffness of the arteries.\n\nStay healthy!"

If you want, you can get to know the most important structures that can be demonstrated in ultrasound and then apply and deepen your knowledge in the ultrasound simulator. This will help you understand the growth of your own baby.\n\nScanBaby is divided into three different modes:\n\n-Scan mode: Here you can scan a baby all by yourself (not your own actual baby). Turn on labelling mode to see all the important structures colored. This way you can compare the ScanBaby image to your own ultrasound image and understand the shown structures better.\n\n-Learn mode: This beautifully crafted mode teaches you about the developmental stages of your child. Get to know all the changes that happen to you and your baby during pregnancy. We have included artfully crafted 3D scans of real babies that you can move around all by yourself and experience how your baby might currently look like. Of course all of these scans come with labelling as well.\n\n-Watch mode: Here we have included many different ultrasound videos you might actually see in a similar way during your own examination. All come with a short explanation what can be seen. Watch a baby dance inside the uterus, play with the umbilical cord and even react to the caressing of the father.\nTerms of use: https://scanbooster.com/index.php/impressum#qx-heading-1479"

You might want to know if their glucose levels go too high or too low, be able to quickly and easily access their insulin pump and Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) system information. \r\n \r\nWith the CareLink™ Connect app, now you can remotely see their glucose levels and insulin pump information wherever you are, so you can know how they are doing.\r\n\r\nThe CareLink™ Connect app helps you quickly accomplish these tasks: \r\nLet you securely view glucose levels, graphs, and trends\r\nSends you high or low glucose levels notifications, so you can be informed and supportive\r\nShows you the status of the insulin pump system, for greater peace of mind\r\n\r\nTo remotely view pump system information, family members or friends need to install the CareLink™ Connect app on their compatible mobile device. Also, the person with diabetes needs a MiniMed™ 700-series insulin pump, the MiniMed™ Mobile app installed on a compatible mobile device, which then should be connected online to the CareLink™ software. To find a list of compatible devices, please visit your local Medtronic website. \r\n\r\nIMPORTANT NOTE: In order to receive real-time updates, the app needs to continuously receive data from the CareLink™ servers, and the insulin pump system needs to sync with the CareLink™ servers through the MiniMed™ Mobile app. The CareLink™ Connect app only works with the MiniMed™ 700-series insulin pump systems; it currently does not support other standalone CGM systems, MiniMed™ or Paradigm™ insulin pumps. \r\n\r\nThe CareLink™ Connect app is intended to provide a secondary display of insulin pump and CGM (Continuous Glucose Monitoring) system data on a supported mobile device. CareLink™ Connect app is not intended to replace the real-time display of insulin pump or CGM data on the primary display device. All therapy decisions should be based on the primary display device.\r\n\r\nCareLink™ Connect app is not intended to analyze or modify the insulin pump and CGM data that it receives.

In the checklist you can mark things completed as you proceed. That feels fabulous! \n\nThe weekly pregnancy overview and the index about the trimesters contain links, where you can access the various checklists: Nutritional supplements, maternity clothing, baby gear, choosing where to give birth, birth plan and hospital bag. With these lists you look well after yourself, take gradual steps to redecorate your home to be ready to welcome the baby and you prepare yourself for the birth. What does your little bundle really need, and what items are excessive and unnecessary? What type of birth will be right for you? Our App will help you with all this, so that you can feel confident and enjoy your pregnancy and the early days with your precious newborn baby. \n\nAs a bonus there is a variety of helpful websites, which you will find useful during this special time in your life. \n\nEnjoy this App! \n\nKirstin and Roman"

The BackHome app lets you do that – but it goes beyond that too allowing owners to store other pet information."

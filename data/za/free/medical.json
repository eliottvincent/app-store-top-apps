It offers a comprehensive and practical range of products and services covering the majority of species and pathologies. \nVirbac innovation, based on both technological advances and listening to the customers, relies on reactive production facilities which meet the highest international quality standards. For nearly 50 years, this has allowed the company to build a personalized relationship with veterinarians in every country. Through this privileged partnership, in which social, health and environmental issues come together, Virbac contributes, day after day, to shape the future of animal health. \nThe BackHome App embraces the company’s philosophy using the latest 21st century platforms to  provide services to its customers.\nThe BackHome app allows Veterinarians, Pet Owners and Welfare Organisations mobile access to the national database of registered microchips assuring pet owners that if their pets are lost, there is a national resource in place to help them be reunited with their pets as quickly and safely as possible. \nThe BackHome app allows users to look up microchip numbers should a lost pet be found to find the owner and to reunite the pet with its owner. The app enables Vets, Owners and Welfare Organisations to register pets on the national database and store contact information. Pet Owners can keep their pet information updated in an easy to use interface with some added features too. For example, if you are going on holiday, you can create temporary addresses. \nRegistering pets and keeping their information updated is one of the most important things people can do for the welfare of their pets. The BackHome app lets you do that – but it goes beyond that too allowing owners to store other pet information."

The app will help to track your contractions and determine when it's time to go to the hospital.\nIf you plan on having a home birth, the app will tell you what stage of labor you are in at any given moment.\n\nKeep track of your labor by tapping a single button at the start and at the end of each contraction. The Contraction Timer analyzes the duration and frequency of contractions and will notify you when it's time to go to the hospital.\n\nThousands of pregnant women around the world have become mothers using our app.\n\nAlways consult your doctor to orient yourself in terms of contraction frequency and duration.\nThis app is not a medical device and our recomendations are based on standard indicators. Your labor may occur differently. Therefore, do not rely exclusively on our app.\nIf the duration and frequency of contractions do not yet correspond to the necessary indicators but labor pains become unbearable, it is better to go to the hospital as soon as possible rather than give birth at home or on the way there. Trust what your body is telling you.\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, please email us at neumandev@gmail.com. Your feedback is very important to us."

For measurement use, FDA-approved blood pressure monitors.\n\nApp Main Features:\n \n- Modern and user-friendly interface\n- High blood pressure control\n- Clear graphs\n- Measurement history\n- Reminders and notifications\n\nBlood Pressure Levels:\n\nNormal: Systolic 90-119 and Diastolic 60-79\nHypotension: Systolic 90 and less or Diastolic 60 and less\nElevated: Systolic 120-129 and Diastolic 60-80\nHypertension - Stage 1: Systolic 130-139 or Diastolic 80-90\nHypertension - Stage 2: Systolic 140-180 or Diastolic 90-120\nHypertensive: Systolic 180 and higher or Diastolic 120 and higher\n\nAging Adults:\n\nIn adults, systolic blood pressure rises from early adulthood onward, up to at least age 70. Diastolic pressure tends to begin to rise at the same time but starts to fall earlier in mid-life, approximately age 55. Mean blood pressure rises from early adulthood, plateauing in mid-life, while pulse pressure rises quite markedly after the age of 40.\n\nConsequently, in many older people, systolic blood pressure often exceeds the normal adult range. The rise in pulse pressure with age is attributed to increased stiffness of the arteries.\n\nStay healthy!"

      "label": "Record burn regions using professional editing tools. Vector-based graphics for high-precision detail. Easy, fast and simple to use. Quick Calculator for immediate Parkland results. Enhanced Rule of Nines using BMI and Rule of Eights for infants under 10 kg and adults over 80 kg using the Rule of Fives.\n\nThe Total Surface Burn Area (TBSA) is calculated from the drawn regions using the Rule of Nines, Eights, Fives or Lund and Browder. Along with the patient’s weight, height, gender, and chart-type (adult, child, infant), the Parkland Formula is used to determine an accurate amount of fluids to give the patient. Additionally, the provided Abbreviated Burn Severity Index (ABSI) can then provide an estimated mortality rate. \n\nKEY FEATURES\nCreate, View, Sort, Search, Edit, and More - Unlike other calculation software, you can view and revise past records. Organize the chart list view by select fields or find results by customized title.\n\nQuick, Efficient and Detailed Calculations - Edit quickly with simple inputs using Quick Calculate. Bypass patient measurement information to quickly draw burn regions and return to add patient details later.\n\nEncrypted & Compliant - Patient charts are stored locally with high-level encryption.\n\nEnhanced Rules - An available option in the application considers the latest medical studies to calculate more accurately based on BMI and body-type.\n\nProfessional Editing Tools - Use the basic Brush tool commonly seen in other software or take advantage of the Lasso tool to quickly draw the entire burn region in one motion!\n\nPan and Zoom! - Two-Finger-Pan, Touch-to-Pan, Pinch-to-Zoom, and more allow for precision results and faster burn region input.\n\nReverse-draw - Reverse side is drawn under the current view to allow the burn pattern to be matched from the anterior to the posterior.\n\nVector-based Graphics - Utilizing point-to-point Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) stores the burn region as a digital value for: Better precision feedback / display, future-proofing as calculations and formulas change, and more.\n\nShare Results - Charts are exportable using the native devices 'Share' feature. Subscribe or purchase individual 'Share Charts' items for full calculation details and advanced file-types such as PDF.\n\nTailored Preferences - Default opening a chart to Move mode to prevent accidental input, or default to Edit mode for faster input.\n\nCustom Basis Values - Enter your weighted basis value that best suits your knowledge and expertise or facility guidelines. Available for adult and child/infant charts separately.\n\nFAQs\nQ. How do calculations work?\nA. Anterior and Posterior body regions are divided into an average total of 35 different parts (hand, lower arm, upper arm, etc.). Each section is then combined into the respective region for display purposes (arm, leg) to give the total value for a more user-friendly view. The system then reduces and evaluates each collection of regions and determines the percentage of the clipped area that is filled-in. Each collection is then totaled and input into the Parkland Formula to determine the amount of fluids to provide.\n\nQ. How are records stored securely?\nA. Patient charts are stored locally with AES-256 using cipher block chaining (CBC) mode and a unique initialization vector (IV) which is never reused within a file, and then signed with a SHA-2 HMAC.\n\nAll data collected is encrypted and used to provide recommendations. All information displayed should be verified and only used with the assistance or advice of a trained licensed professional. Sharing charts is not secure, and is subject to the encryption mechanisms used in the transfer to the selected 3rd-party application(s).\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/"

      "label": "My Baby Heart Sounds is a quick and easy way to use your iPhone to listen, record and share your baby's heart sounds.\n\nNot too long ago, we were pregnant mothers too. While our partners enjoyed listening to our babies' sounds by placing their ears on the tummy, we wanted to capture and share these precious audio-memories ourselves. We tried voice memo apps and other sound-recording apps but felt that there was something more we could do to improve the quality of the sound in a simple setup. Fast forward a couple years and here we are!\n\nWhy should you try this app?\n- Minimum time to setup. All you need is your iPhone. Simple instructions are provided within the app and we are here to support you all the way.\n- High quality sound. Using advanced audio signal processing techniques, we deliver a high quality audio experience that allows you to distinguish your baby's heart sounds. For best results use AirPods.\n- Listen for free and only pay when you want to record and share.\n- Secure. All recordings are stored on your phone. We do not have any access to your recordings. You decide how you would like to share your recordings.\n\nFree version:\nWith the free version, listen to your baby's heart sounds unlimited number of times. When you are satisfied, you can purchase a premium version that allows you to record and share unlimited audio recordings of special moments and memories.\n\nOne time in-app purchase:\n- Features included in Free version.\n- Create unlimited audio recordings of special moments and memories. This feature requires a one time in app purchase. \n- Tag locations to remember and visualize where your chances are best for the next time you would like to hear your baby's heart sound.\n- When you would like to share the recording, multiple options are provided that include email, text and other social media apps. \n- Store the recording outside the app on your device or external storage apps.\n\nFor best results:\n- Use the app when you are 20-30 weeks or greater pregnant.\n- Use the app in a quiet room\n- Remove any phone case/shell/cover (the iPhone needs to touch your skin to be able to pick up the sounds)\n- Put the phone in Airplane Mode\n- Start the app and place the iPhone on your tummy to listen for a clear sound. You may need to try a few different spots. Press \"Record\" to create a recording\n- Use AirPods\n\nMy Baby Heart Sounds Disclaimer:\n- The My Baby Heart Sounds app is NOT a Medical Device or application. It is NOT in any way suitable for medical opinion, advice or diagnosis, and it is NOT intended to provide any information about the person of use's wellbeing or health.\n- The app does NOT backup recordings automatically outside the user's device. It is the user's responsibility to regularly backup their recordings."

This project was inspired by the tremendous success of our MGH ACLS app, which has thousands of clinician users in over 100 countries.

To this end, we have developed a free, intuitive, and rigorously vetted mobile app to assist healthcare clinicians—at any stage of training—navigate PALS at the bedside.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Intuitive design to rapidly access PALS pathways  (i.e. cardiac arrest , tachycardia with pulse, bradycardia with pulse, post cardiac arrest care, and critical care references)\n\n- Includes all PALS content including drug therapy and dosing, reversible causes, etc.\n\n- Easy-to-read timers and ability to log rounds of CPR, epinephrine, and defibrillations\n\n- Button within cardiac arrest algorithm that allows for rapid transition to post cardiac arrest care checklist once patient achieves ROSC\n\n- Relevant critical care references: (1) drugs used in PALS (i.e., medication names, indications, and doses); (2) vital signs in children; (3) pediatric color-coded length-based resuscitation tape (Breslow tape) ; (4) pediatric Glasgow Coma Scale\n\n- All content rigorously vetted by AHA science team and practicing Harvard-affiliated physicians\n\n- Regularly updated with the most up-to-date PALS content"

There is another version of INSIGHT KIDNEY for non-enterprise users. \r\n\nINSIGHT KIDNEY for Enterprise, developed and owned by ANIMA RES, is delivered by the Gig Immersive Learning Platform and is intended to be used as a managed app with the Gig Immersive Learning Platform. Only registered users in the Gig Immersive Learning Platform are allowed to access the mobile app. \r\n\r\nINSIGHT KIDNEY - The human kidney expedition\r\n\r\nThis is the third Augmented Reality App to be rolled out in a series of Apps created and designed for medical education purposes.\r\n\nOur goal is to make medical education fascinating, explorable, and fun for students, physicians as well as accessible to patients - anywhere and anytime, in or out of the classroom, lecture hall or living room. We have committed ourselves to take medical education one step further and have developed visually stunning and highly interactive content based on real life medical and scientific specifications.\r\n\nINSIGHT KIDNEY for Enterprise, developed and owned by ANIMA RES, is delivered by the Gig Immersive Learning Platform and allows multiple users at your institution to share a session to see the same holograms at the same time – even if you are in disparate locations – for teaching and training purposes. \r\n\r\nEmbark on a journey through the kidney, from macroscopic to microscopic anatomy, and explore the structures of the kidney in unprecedented detail.\r\n\nINSIGHT KIDNEY has visualized pathological changes in addition to anatomically correct representations.\r\n\nTrigger impressive visualizations of the healthy kidney, CKD, aHUS, IgAN and C3G and get an idea of their condition and severity.\r\n\nDue to their rarity, there is a tremendous need for tangible information about these rare kidney diseases.\r\n\nHere, for the first time, Insight Kidney attempts to visualize these rare kidney diseases with anatomically correct 3D representations to fill the knowledge gap for patients. And there is a lot more to come (INSIGHT LUNG, INSIGHT HEART, INSIGHT BONE, INSIGHT EKG) - so stay tuned!\r\n\nThis and the other following apps in the INSIGHT-series will take medical education to a whole new level - no one has ever seen the human kidney in this way before."

Since 2005, MDCalc has been the leading medical reference for the most relevant, up-to-date and widely-used clinical calculators that support evidence-based patient care. Registration is free and takes less than 30 seconds for full, unlimited access.\n\nMDCalc clinical decision support is created exclusively by board-certified physicians for use by physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, and medical students. The simple yet sleek app provides access to 550+ easy-to-use clinical decision tools including risk scores, algorithms, equations, formulas, classifications, dosing calculators, and more.\n\nWith a new enhancement, clinicians can now earn AMA PRA Category 1TM CME credits by simply reading the clinical content for 150+ calculators. The app will keep track of the CME credits earned in a personal dashboard, where users can also redeem credits for certificates and access their receipts for easy documentation. In order to redeem CME credits, users will need to sign up for a paid CME plan.\n\nUnique features, ideal for the busy practicing clinician:\n\n• Works offline and in limited connection settings. (CME tracking requires a connection.)\n• Fast and easy search and filter to discover new calculators.\n• Customizable lists for quick access: favorites, recently used, your specialty.\n• Auto-syncing between the website and app.\n• Quick toggle between US and SI units.\n• Error warnings and normal values to help avoid mistakes and improper inputs.\n\nOur exclusive “MDCalc Method” for selecting tools - including in-depth appraisal and validation of evidence AND clinical relevance - results in only the highest-quality tools to help you make better decisions and be more efficient in your workflow. And our network of academic and practicing physician experts create easy-to-digest content to reinforce decision making and support training:\n\n• Insights and advice from the EBM creators (e.g. Dr. Phil Wells’ on the Wells’ Criteria).\n• Expert content by specialists on use cases, pearls & pitfalls, results interpretation and more.\n• Synopses of the evidence from the original and validation research.\n\nFrom iMedicalApps in 2016: “The evidence based medicine (EBM) components of the medical app are what really set MDCalc apart from its peers... The MDCalc app gives brief summaries of the critical studies concerning the medical calculator, links to the studies on PubMed as well as “pearls/pitfalls”, “next steps” and expert commentary from the authors of the calculators.” - iMedicalApps “MDCalc app, the best online medical calculator is now an app”\n\nMDCalc clinical decision tools support 35+ specialties including cardiology, critical care/ICU, emergency medicine, endocrinology, gastroenterology, hematology, hepatology, infectious disease, internal medicine, nephrology, neurology, obstetrics, oncology, orthopedics, pediatrics, primary care, psychiatry, pulmonology, surgery, urology, and more! Here are some examples of the tools:\n\n* Calculators that include CME content\n\n» Creatinine Clearance (Cockcroft-Gault Equation)\n» CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk\n» Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia\n» MELD Score (Model For End-Stage Liver Disease) (12 and older)\n» HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk\n» CHADS2 Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk\n» HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events *\n» SIRS, Sepsis, and Septic Shock Criteria *\n» Fractional Excretion of Sodium (FENa)\n» Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) *\n» Wells’ Criteria for Pulmonary Embolism *\n» Wells’ Criteria for DVT"

We don’t blame you for falling asleep on the couch occasionally, so we’ve got you covered with handy alarms and reminders.

Unfortunately for some parents, it’s imperative that they track every last drop of food their baby eats since some infants are born with illnesses that make it harder to gain weight normally. Keeping track of diapers is also imperative to keeping your baby healthy. Everyone needs an easy way to check how often they’re changing diapers, and if everything looks normal during each change.\n\nJust click the appropriate button at the beginning of the feeding and other activities. Your baby care history will be reliably stored. All this information may be useful when you visit the pediatrician, as well as for the further development of your child.\n\nCheck your baby’s day to day activities easily and efficiently.

For measurement use, FDA-approved blood pressure monitors.\n\nApp Main Features:\n \n- Modern and user-friendly interface\n- High blood pressure control\n- Clear graphs\n- Measurement history\n- Reminders and notifications\n\nBlood Pressure Levels:\n\nNormal: Systolic 90-119 and Diastolic 60-79\nHypotension: Systolic 90 and less or Diastolic 60 and less\nElevated: Systolic 120-129 and Diastolic 60-80\nHypertension - Stage 1: Systolic 130-139 or Diastolic 80-90\nHypertension - Stage 2: Systolic 140-180 or Diastolic 90-120\nHypertensive: Systolic 180 and higher or Diastolic 120 and higher\n\nAging Adults:\n\nIn adults, systolic blood pressure rises from early adulthood onward, up to at least age 70. Diastolic pressure tends to begin to rise at the same time but starts to fall earlier in mid-life, approximately age 55. Mean blood pressure rises from early adulthood, plateauing in mid-life, while pulse pressure rises quite markedly after the age of 40.\n\nConsequently, in many older people, systolic blood pressure often exceeds the normal adult range. The rise in pulse pressure with age is attributed to increased stiffness of the arteries.\n\nStay healthy!"

      "label": "My Baby Heart Sounds is a quick and easy way to use your iPhone to listen, record and share your baby's heart sounds.\n\nNot too long ago, we were pregnant mothers too. While our partners enjoyed listening to our babies' sounds by placing their ears on the tummy, we wanted to capture and share these precious audio-memories ourselves. We tried voice memo apps and other sound-recording apps but felt that there was something more we could do to improve the quality of the sound in a simple setup. Fast forward a couple years and here we are!\n\nWhy should you try this app?\n- Minimum time to setup. All you need is your iPhone. Simple instructions are provided within the app and we are here to support you all the way.\n- High quality sound. Using advanced audio signal processing techniques, we deliver a high quality audio experience that allows you to distinguish your baby's heart sounds. For best results use AirPods.\n- Listen for free and only pay when you want to record and share.\n- Secure. All recordings are stored on your phone. We do not have any access to your recordings. You decide how you would like to share your recordings.\n\nFree version:\nWith the free version, listen to your baby's heart sounds unlimited number of times. When you are satisfied, you can purchase a premium version that allows you to record and share unlimited audio recordings of special moments and memories.\n\nOne time in-app purchase:\n- Features included in Free version.\n- Create unlimited audio recordings of special moments and memories. This feature requires a one time in app purchase. \n- Tag locations to remember and visualize where your chances are best for the next time you would like to hear your baby's heart sound.\n- When you would like to share the recording, multiple options are provided that include email, text and other social media apps. \n- Store the recording outside the app on your device or external storage apps.\n\nFor best results:\n- Use the app when you are 20-30 weeks or greater pregnant.\n- Use the app in a quiet room\n- Remove any phone case/shell/cover (the iPhone needs to touch your skin to be able to pick up the sounds)\n- Put the phone in Airplane Mode\n- Start the app and place the iPhone on your tummy to listen for a clear sound. You may need to try a few different spots. Press \"Record\" to create a recording\n- Use AirPods\n\nMy Baby Heart Sounds Disclaimer:\n- The My Baby Heart Sounds app is NOT a Medical Device or application. It is NOT in any way suitable for medical opinion, advice or diagnosis, and it is NOT intended to provide any information about the person of use's wellbeing or health.\n- The app does NOT backup recordings automatically outside the user's device. It is the user's responsibility to regularly backup their recordings."

You can also directly sync with the No.1 snoring tracking app - SnoreLab - to track your progress.\n\nOne of the main causes of snoring is weak muscles in the mouth area. SnoreGym is an exercise app which helps to tone your upper airway muscles to reduce snoring.\n\nSnoreGym will guide you through a set of clinically-proven exercises for your tongue, soft palate, cheeks and jaw.\n\nFeatures include:\n- Exercises to reduce snoring\n- Easy-to-follow animations\n- Clear and detailed instructions\n- Evidence-based workouts\n- Progress tracking\n- Sync to SnoreLab\n\nScientists have tested a set of mouth exercises which tone muscles in the tongue, soft palate, throat, cheeks and jaw. This research has shown that mouth exercises can reduce snoring, decrease the severity of sleep apnea, reduce disturbance of bed partners and produce better sleep and quality of life.\n\nIt is important to do these exercises regularly to reduce your snoring. We recommend at least 10 minutes a day for 8+ weeks.\n\nExercise now for quieter sleep!"

      "label": "Does the world need another OB-wheel-due-date-calculator app?  You bet!  OB Wheels combines three things that clinicians need to derive all the dates necessary in pregnancy care, and no other app has this combination.   \n\nIt contains a calendar calculator to determine EDD (EDC) from LMP or from a sonogram report.  The calendar calculator also provides gestational age (EGA) as of any date for a given EDD or LMP.  Because the calculator works off the real calendar, it is accurate for leap years too.\n\nThen for all of you who miss your cardboard OB wheel, the app contains one which you can rotate, pinch and zoom, and generally play with just like a regular cardboard wheel.  It's a little tricky to learn how to plant two fingers and rotate them rather than pinch-and-zoom to get rotation versus resizing.  But the wheel works and it is accurate, especially so because you can zoom in to be sure where the little date hash lines lie.\n\nFinally, the app notes the most recent committee opinion scheme from ACOG on how one might reconcile due dates from LMP and sonograms to arrive at a single final EDD.  To my knowledge, the scheme is authority-based and no better or worse than other schemes, but my practice and my learners need a single clear scheme, so this app includes one for easy reference.\n\nAs an educator and clinician myself, I am grateful for feedback.  Email me via the contact email at my website."

      "label": "Respi-Rate is a practical application which helps healthcare professionals to determine the patient's respiratory rate.\r\n \r\nThe respiratory rate is usually determined by estimating or measuring the number of breaths at a certain time interval, followed by conversion to a one-minute respiratory rate.\r\n \r\nWith Respi-Rate, you only need to press the \"Lungs button\" – each time the patient starts to inhale. The application calculates the respiratory rate using its own innovative algorithm. \r\n \r\nMETHODOLOGY DESCRIPTION\r\nFor example, the \"Lung button\" is pressed at 00:00 (mm:ss) and 00:05 – in both cases, when the patient starts to inhale. The interval between the first and the second breath is 5 seconds. The calculated RR, in this case, is 12 (60 seconds divided by the intervals, 60/5=12). \r\nThe application takes the user's reaction time into account (the time between the start of the patient's breath and the pressing of the button in the application), and the standard deviation of the reaction time. Therefore, after each pressing of the “Lungs button\", the application verifies whether the determination of the respiratory rate can be considered accurate. If not, then the application continues to define additional intervals so that the accuracy of the determined respiratory rate is at 95% ± 1 breath / min. with a regular breathing pattern.\r\n \r\nFor the most accurate calculation, it is important to keep pressing the button at the same stage of the breath cycle (for example when the patient begins to inhale). Do not use this application when the patient's breathing is irregular.\r\n \r\nPlease consult your doctor before making a medical decision.\r\n \r\nFast & simple. Enjoy the app!"

Beginning with the patient’s presenting symptoms, they ultimately narrow down multiple options to one condition.  The DSM-5 Differential Diagnosis Handbook can play a critical role in this process by improving the diagnostic process of psychiatric conditions.  Leveraging latest DSM-5 classifications from the American Psychiatric Association, users are able to use a trusted 6-step process when dealing with, sometimes unfamiliar, psych conditions.  \n\nExclusive, integrated interactive decision trees provide a step-by-step process of asking yes or no questions to find a tentative diagnosis.  When the initial diagnosis is reached, tables of differential diagnoses are presented to help confirm or present new options.  \n\nFEATURES\n• Interactive decision trees for narrowing down psychiatric diagnoses\n• Algorithms for enhanced assessment\n• The latest DSM-5 classifications and ICD-10 codes\n• Helpful tables of differential diagnoses\n• Detailed entries featuring definitions for each psychiatric condition\n• Expansive guidance on all 6 steps of the differential diagnosis process \n• Advanced Search to help find topics quickly \n• “Favorites” for bookmarking important entries\n\nAuthor: Michael B.

      "label": "Get your life back from tinnitus. Let Oto help you feel calmer, find control and sleep better with its expertly designed tinnitus program. Oto has helped thousands of people learn to live with tinnitus. 86% report feeling better and have less stress after just 1 month.\n\n*‘I was told nothing would help and I had to live with it. Now I feel normal again!’*  - Maid Myriam\n\nThere is tinnitus help. This is not a tinnitus cure but Oto will show you how to push tinnitus into the background of life, so you can get back to what matters. So whether it’s ringing in the ears, whooshing, buzzing or a range of sounds, in just a few minutes a day, Oto will help you get your life back from tinnitus.\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\n\nOto will teach you how to stop caring about tinnitus. Gradually you’ll become less and less aware of it so eventually you can forget it’s even there. \n\nDISCOVER YOUR STAGE\n\nFirst up, you’ll discover which stage of the journey you’re at. Habituation is when tinnitus becomes like breathing: it’s a constant noise that is so normal, you forget it’s there. There are four stages to habituation and you’ll learn which one you’re at, as well as where you’re headed next. \n\nDAILY GUIDANCE\n\nYou’ll listen to a 5-10 minute audio session each day which will introduce you to a range of clinically proven techniques. Over the course of the program, you’ll learn which techniques work best for you and how to use them in a normal day. \n\nEnjoy the renowned therapy of Anna Pugh - an award winning tinnitus therapist - from the comfort of your own home with the daily sessions. Oto’s program has been created by doctors who understand tinnitus. They have tinnitus themselves, as well as decades of experience.\n\nWHAT YOU’LL GET\n\nLearn:\n- CBT for tinnitus\n- Mindfulness sessions\n- Visualisation techniques\n- Sleep advice\n\nRelax:\n- Relaxation Therapy\n- Relaxing Sounds\n- Original Soundscapes\n- Binaural Beats\n- 3D Sounds\n- SOS sessions for moments of panic\n\nSleep well:\n- Sleep Sounds\n- Sleep Stories\n- Mindfulness for Sleep\n- Guided Sleep Meditation\n- White Noise\n\nPhysical therapy:\n- Tension release exercises\n- Jaw and neck relaxation\n- Shoulder release\n\nWHAT OUR CUSTOMERS SAY\n\n“So grateful for this app…Easily the best value for any app I've ever bought. I've spent more on professional visits that amounted to a shrug. Thank you Oto.” - Robert\n\n“After having a scuba diving accident, I developed tinnitus. I found Oto, wow, what a blessing. I was going off my mind and suddenly this had success. Keep up the sessions, go over it again. Worth every penny, it’s a lifesaver. 10/10 stars Thanks to the Oto team.” - Clinton\n\n“The OTO app has changed my life. I have had tinnitus for 3 years with no success in dealing with it. When I found the app and used it every day my life has changed. It hasn’t cured it but has helped me get in with my life instead of being a hostage to the noise. Each day is easier and brighter. Thank you.” - Taylor\n\nDISCLAIMER\n\nOto is not a tinnitus cure or tinnitus treatment. Whilst Oto is designed to help to reduce the impact of the distress associated with tinnitus, it should not be used as a substitute for, or replace professional medical advice, diagnosis or treatment.

The simple yet sleek app provides access to 550+ easy-to-use clinical decision tools including risk scores, algorithms, equations, formulas, classifications, dosing calculators, and more.\n\nWith a new enhancement, clinicians can now earn AMA PRA Category 1TM CME credits by simply reading the clinical content for 150+ calculators. The app will keep track of the CME credits earned in a personal dashboard, where users can also redeem credits for certificates and access their receipts for easy documentation. In order to redeem CME credits, users will need to sign up for a paid CME plan.\n\nUnique features, ideal for the busy practicing clinician:\n\n• Works offline and in limited connection settings.

The MDCalc app gives brief summaries of the critical studies concerning the medical calculator, links to the studies on PubMed as well as “pearls/pitfalls”, “next steps” and expert commentary from the authors of the calculators.” - iMedicalApps “MDCalc app, the best online medical calculator is now an app”\n\nMDCalc clinical decision tools support 35+ specialties including cardiology, critical care/ICU, emergency medicine, endocrinology, gastroenterology, hematology, hepatology, infectious disease, internal medicine, nephrology, neurology, obstetrics, oncology, orthopedics, pediatrics, primary care, psychiatry, pulmonology, surgery, urology, and more!

It offers a comprehensive and practical range of products and services covering the majority of species and pathologies. \nVirbac innovation, based on both technological advances and listening to the customers, relies on reactive production facilities which meet the highest international quality standards. For nearly 50 years, this has allowed the company to build a personalized relationship with veterinarians in every country. Through this privileged partnership, in which social, health and environmental issues come together, Virbac contributes, day after day, to shape the future of animal health. \nThe BackHome App embraces the company’s philosophy using the latest 21st century platforms to  provide services to its customers.\nThe BackHome app allows Veterinarians, Pet Owners and Welfare Organisations mobile access to the national database of registered microchips assuring pet owners that if their pets are lost, there is a national resource in place to help them be reunited with their pets as quickly and safely as possible. \nThe BackHome app allows users to look up microchip numbers should a lost pet be found to find the owner and to reunite the pet with its owner. The app enables Vets, Owners and Welfare Organisations to register pets on the national database and store contact information. Pet Owners can keep their pet information updated in an easy to use interface with some added features too. For example, if you are going on holiday, you can create temporary addresses. \nRegistering pets and keeping their information updated is one of the most important things people can do for the welfare of their pets. The BackHome app lets you do that – but it goes beyond that too allowing owners to store other pet information."

The Contraction Timer analyzes the duration and frequency of contractions and will notify you when it's time to go to the hospital.\n\nThousands of pregnant women around the world have become mothers using our app.\n\nAlways consult your doctor to orient yourself in terms of contraction frequency and duration.\nThis app is not a medical device and our recomendations are based on standard indicators. Your labor may occur differently. Therefore, do not rely exclusively on our app.\nIf the duration and frequency of contractions do not yet correspond to the necessary indicators but labor pains become unbearable, it is better to go to the hospital as soon as possible rather than give birth at home or on the way there.

It offers a comprehensive and practical range of products and services covering the majority of species and pathologies. \nVirbac innovation, based on both technological advances and listening to the customers, relies on reactive production facilities which meet the highest international quality standards. For nearly 50 years, this has allowed the company to build a personalized relationship with veterinarians in every country. Through this privileged partnership, in which social, health and environmental issues come together, Virbac contributes, day after day, to shape the future of animal health. \nThe BackHome App embraces the company’s philosophy using the latest 21st century platforms to  provide services to its customers.\nThe BackHome app allows Veterinarians, Pet Owners and Welfare Organisations mobile access to the national database of registered microchips assuring pet owners that if their pets are lost, there is a national resource in place to help them be reunited with their pets as quickly and safely as possible. \nThe BackHome app allows users to look up microchip numbers should a lost pet be found to find the owner and to reunite the pet with its owner. The app enables Vets, Owners and Welfare Organisations to register pets on the national database and store contact information. Pet Owners can keep their pet information updated in an easy to use interface with some added features too. For example, if you are going on holiday, you can create temporary addresses. \nRegistering pets and keeping their information updated is one of the most important things people can do for the welfare of their pets. The BackHome app lets you do that – but it goes beyond that too allowing owners to store other pet information."

      "label": "Does the world need another OB-wheel-due-date-calculator app?  You bet!  OB Wheels combines three things that clinicians need to derive all the dates necessary in pregnancy care, and no other app has this combination.   \n\nIt contains a calendar calculator to determine EDD (EDC) from LMP or from a sonogram report.  The calendar calculator also provides gestational age (EGA) as of any date for a given EDD or LMP.  Because the calculator works off the real calendar, it is accurate for leap years too.\n\nThen for all of you who miss your cardboard OB wheel, the app contains one which you can rotate, pinch and zoom, and generally play with just like a regular cardboard wheel.  It's a little tricky to learn how to plant two fingers and rotate them rather than pinch-and-zoom to get rotation versus resizing.  But the wheel works and it is accurate, especially so because you can zoom in to be sure where the little date hash lines lie.\n\nFinally, the app notes the most recent committee opinion scheme from ACOG on how one might reconcile due dates from LMP and sonograms to arrive at a single final EDD.  To my knowledge, the scheme is authority-based and no better or worse than other schemes, but my practice and my learners need a single clear scheme, so this app includes one for easy reference.\n\nAs an educator and clinician myself, I am grateful for feedback.  Email me via the contact email at my website."

This app lets you focus on the patient without sacrificing proper documentation.\n\nFCP 3.4 includes a user controlled metronome with an adjustable rate between 100 and 120 bpm.  Now you can use FCP to check your CPR rate performance.\n\nUsing this real-time app to log your actions, you can improve the availability and accuracy of documentation of a resuscitation event. This gives you more robust data for review, debriefing and resuscitation quality improvement. FCP 3.3 has a customizable drug list, pre-populated with common cardiac arrest drugs. It also includes lists of common events and rhythms.\n\nIt is highly recommended that you back up all of your log files in your database and remove older versions of FCP before installing this new version. All log files and data from version 2.O and 2.2 will NOT transfer to Version 3.4\n\nFCP 3.4 is for use by paramedics, EMT-Bs, emergency room nurses, emergency room physicians and other in- and out-of-hospital healthcare providers."

      "label": "My Baby Heart Sounds is a quick and easy way to use your iPhone to listen, record and share your baby's heart sounds.\n\nNot too long ago, we were pregnant mothers too. While our partners enjoyed listening to our babies' sounds by placing their ears on the tummy, we wanted to capture and share these precious audio-memories ourselves. We tried voice memo apps and other sound-recording apps but felt that there was something more we could do to improve the quality of the sound in a simple setup. Fast forward a couple years and here we are!\n\nWhy should you try this app?\n- Minimum time to setup. All you need is your iPhone. Simple instructions are provided within the app and we are here to support you all the way.\n- High quality sound. Using advanced audio signal processing techniques, we deliver a high quality audio experience that allows you to distinguish your baby's heart sounds. For best results use AirPods.\n- Listen for free and only pay when you want to record and share.\n- Secure. All recordings are stored on your phone. We do not have any access to your recordings. You decide how you would like to share your recordings.\n\nFree version:\nWith the free version, listen to your baby's heart sounds unlimited number of times. When you are satisfied, you can purchase a premium version that allows you to record and share unlimited audio recordings of special moments and memories.\n\nOne time in-app purchase:\n- Features included in Free version.\n- Create unlimited audio recordings of special moments and memories. This feature requires a one time in app purchase. \n- Tag locations to remember and visualize where your chances are best for the next time you would like to hear your baby's heart sound.\n- When you would like to share the recording, multiple options are provided that include email, text and other social media apps. \n- Store the recording outside the app on your device or external storage apps.\n\nFor best results:\n- Use the app when you are 20-30 weeks or greater pregnant.\n- Use the app in a quiet room\n- Remove any phone case/shell/cover (the iPhone needs to touch your skin to be able to pick up the sounds)\n- Put the phone in Airplane Mode\n- Start the app and place the iPhone on your tummy to listen for a clear sound. You may need to try a few different spots.

This free tool allows you to track your babies’ movements, and strength of your baby, on a daily basis, while giving you data to share with your provider. In-app messaging empowers you to speak up if there is a change in what’s normal for your baby and provides you with guidance on how to monitor it. Research shows a change in fetal movement can be the earliest and sometimes only indication that a baby is in distress and should be checked by a provider. Kick counting is a great way to bond with your baby, and 78% of app users say it lowers their anxiety during pregnancy.\r\n\r\nCount the Kicks app features include:\r\n- Ability to rate the strength of your baby’s movements\r\n- Ability to download and send kick-counting data directly from the app\r\n- Ability to take notes on each kick-counting session\r\n- Available in 16 languages: Amharic, Arabic, Burmese, Chinese, Dari, English, French, Haitian-Creole, Hebrew, Hindi, Marshallese, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swahili, and Vietnamese \r\n- Ability to track movements of single babies or twins\r\n- Easy-to-read graphs that show your baby’s normal movement history\r\n- Login via social media or accounts such as Google or Microsoft\r\n- Daily interactive and educational messages that appear after a kick session has been saved\r\n- Notifications to remind users to count kicks\r\n- An optional survey for users to inform us of their experience using the app and the outcome of their pregnancy\r\n- \"Baby save\" stories within the app and the ability for users to submit a baby save story directly from the app\r\n- Available on Apple Watch and on your desktop computer."

      "label": "HepB Consult from CCO is an easy-to-use, point-of care resource for all healthcare professionals and others affected by hepatitis B. This Interactive Decision Support Tool draws upon expert consensus guidelines to provide customized recommendations on whether and how to treat hepatitis B in a specific patient setting. Depending on your country, you can choose whether to review advice from US, European, or Asia-Pacific guidelines.\n\nThe tool asks you a series of questions to define a specific HBV case and then presents personalized recommendations for exactly that individual.\n\nHOW TO USE\n1. Enter specific patient characteristics through a series of multiple-choice questions \n\n2. Optionally, look up information about each characteristic to better understand why they are necessary to consider when making management choices\n\n3. Instantly see the guideline recommendations for your scenario and consider your practice plan\n\n4. Learn more by reviewing additional online content or entering a new case\n\nThe goal of the tool is to educate on optimal management choices for monitoring or treating individuals with chronic HBV infection based on current practice guidelines in the United States, Europe, or Asia-Pacific regions. \n\nThe tool will be helpful for clinicians who provide care for patients with HBV infection, including primary care providers, GI and liver specialists, and those in the fields of hepatology and gastroenterology.\n\nThe current tool was created in March 2019 and reflects recommendations from the published AASLD, EASL, and APASL guidelines available at that time.\n\nSpecial thanks to Drs. Kosh Agarwal, Paul Y. Kwo, and Grace LH Wong who provided expert advice, knowledge, and support in the development of this Interactive Decision Support Tool.\n\nThis educational tool is part of a CME-certified program developed independently by CCO - Clinical Care Options, LLC, and produced in collaboration with the American Liver Foundation, the Asian Health Foundation and Practicing Clinicians Exchange. It is supported by an educational grant provided by Gilead Sciences.\n\nFor additional information on best practices in the management of hepatitis B, including a supplemental educational module and downloadable slideset, go online to clinicaloptions.com/HBVbestpractices.

Diastolic pressure tends to begin to rise at the same time but starts to fall earlier in mid-life, approximately age 55. Mean blood pressure rises from early adulthood, plateauing in mid-life, while pulse pressure rises quite markedly after the age of 40.\n\nConsequently, in many older people, systolic blood pressure often exceeds the normal adult range. The rise in pulse pressure with age is attributed to increased stiffness of the arteries.\n\nStay healthy!"

You can also directly sync with the No.1 snoring tracking app - SnoreLab - to track your progress.\n\nOne of the main causes of snoring is weak muscles in the mouth area. SnoreGym is an exercise app which helps to tone your upper airway muscles to reduce snoring.\n\nSnoreGym will guide you through a set of clinically-proven exercises for your tongue, soft palate, cheeks and jaw.\n\nFeatures include:\n- Exercises to reduce snoring\n- Easy-to-follow animations\n- Clear and detailed instructions\n- Evidence-based workouts\n- Progress tracking\n- Sync to SnoreLab\n\nScientists have tested a set of mouth exercises which tone muscles in the tongue, soft palate, throat, cheeks and jaw. This research has shown that mouth exercises can reduce snoring, decrease the severity of sleep apnea, reduce disturbance of bed partners and produce better sleep and quality of life.\n\nIt is important to do these exercises regularly to reduce your snoring. We recommend at least 10 minutes a day for 8+ weeks.\n\nExercise now for quieter sleep!"

You can save diaper changes, sleeping periods and the results of your baby's height and weight measurements.\n\nWith this baby care app, you get all of these incredible features:\n- Track feeding by one breast or by both, if you give your baby two breasts at one feeding\n- Track bottle feeding \n- Fix solid food feeding - food and its amount\n- If you need to express your milk, you can fix how many ml/oz of each breast were pumped \n- Fix diaper changing, you can note whether it is wet or dirty, or both\n- Always know how many diapers were changed per day\n- Record baths, temperatures, walks, and medications\n- Handy breastfeeding timer and sleeping timer are easy to stop and to restart\n- Your baby's height and weight can be measured almost daily! They are also easily stored in the baby diary. \n- Add a reminder for each event - periodic and easy-to-set\n- Log and track the activity of several babies. Supports twins!\n\nBeing a FTM (first-time-mom), or mom in general, is very tiring and challenging! You’ve just made it home from the hospital, exhausted and overwhelmed by your new responsibilities, and need a little help. Don’t worry! In the first few months of your baby's life, it really revolves around eating, sleeping, diaper changes and occasional little doctor's visits. As a new mom, it’s not always easy to remember the last time you fed your baby or changed their diaper. We don’t blame you for falling asleep on the couch occasionally, so we’ve got you covered with handy alarms and reminders. Alarms and graphs are a great way to have an at-a-glance look at what you need to do without stressing over \"what if I forget?”.\n\nOur app will help you keep track of feedings, your baby’s weight and how long they were eating to make sure they’re gaining weight properly and at a normal rate. Unfortunately for some parents, it’s imperative that they track every last drop of food their baby eats since some infants are born with illnesses that make it harder to gain weight normally. Keeping track of diapers is also imperative to keeping your baby healthy. Everyone needs an easy way to check how often they’re changing diapers, and if everything looks normal during each change.\n\nJust click the appropriate button at the beginning of the feeding and other activities.

      "label": "My Baby Heart Sounds is a quick and easy way to use your iPhone to listen, record and share your baby's heart sounds.\n\nNot too long ago, we were pregnant mothers too. While our partners enjoyed listening to our babies' sounds by placing their ears on the tummy, we wanted to capture and share these precious audio-memories ourselves. We tried voice memo apps and other sound-recording apps but felt that there was something more we could do to improve the quality of the sound in a simple setup. Fast forward a couple years and here we are!\n\nWhy should you try this app?\n- Minimum time to setup. All you need is your iPhone. Simple instructions are provided within the app and we are here to support you all the way.\n- High quality sound. Using advanced audio signal processing techniques, we deliver a high quality audio experience that allows you to distinguish your baby's heart sounds. For best results use AirPods.\n- Listen for free and only pay when you want to record and share.\n- Secure. All recordings are stored on your phone. We do not have any access to your recordings. You decide how you would like to share your recordings.\n\nFree version:\nWith the free version, listen to your baby's heart sounds unlimited number of times. When you are satisfied, you can purchase a premium version that allows you to record and share unlimited audio recordings of special moments and memories.\n\nOne time in-app purchase:\n- Features included in Free version.\n- Create unlimited audio recordings of special moments and memories. This feature requires a one time in app purchase. \n- Tag locations to remember and visualize where your chances are best for the next time you would like to hear your baby's heart sound.\n- When you would like to share the recording, multiple options are provided that include email, text and other social media apps. \n- Store the recording outside the app on your device or external storage apps.\n\nFor best results:\n- Use the app when you are 20-30 weeks or greater pregnant.\n- Use the app in a quiet room\n- Remove any phone case/shell/cover (the iPhone needs to touch your skin to be able to pick up the sounds)\n- Put the phone in Airplane Mode\n- Start the app and place the iPhone on your tummy to listen for a clear sound. You may need to try a few different spots. Press \"Record\" to create a recording\n- Use AirPods\n\nMy Baby Heart Sounds Disclaimer:\n- The My Baby Heart Sounds app is NOT a Medical Device or application. It is NOT in any way suitable for medical opinion, advice or diagnosis, and it is NOT intended to provide any information about the person of use's wellbeing or health.\n- The app does NOT backup recordings automatically outside the user's device. It is the user's responsibility to regularly backup their recordings."

Diastolic pressure tends to begin to rise at the same time but starts to fall earlier in mid-life, approximately age 55. Mean blood pressure rises from early adulthood, plateauing in mid-life, while pulse pressure rises quite markedly after the age of 40.\n\nConsequently, in many older people, systolic blood pressure often exceeds the normal adult range. The rise in pulse pressure with age is attributed to increased stiffness of the arteries.\n\nStay healthy!"

If you want, you can get to know the most important structures that can be demonstrated in ultrasound and then apply and deepen your knowledge in the ultrasound simulator. This will help you understand the growth of your own baby.\n\nScanBaby is divided into three different modes:\n\n-Scan mode: Here you can scan a baby all by yourself (not your own actual baby). Turn on labelling mode to see all the important structures colored. This way you can compare the ScanBaby image to your own ultrasound image and understand the shown structures better.\n\n-Learn mode: This beautifully crafted mode teaches you about the developmental stages of your child. Get to know all the changes that happen to you and your baby during pregnancy. We have included artfully crafted 3D scans of real babies that you can move around all by yourself and experience how your baby might currently look like. Of course all of these scans come with labelling as well.\n\n-Watch mode: Here we have included many different ultrasound videos you might actually see in a similar way during your own examination. All come with a short explanation what can be seen. Watch a baby dance inside the uterus, play with the umbilical cord and even react to the caressing of the father.\nTerms of use: https://scanbooster.com/index.php/impressum#qx-heading-1479"

      "label": "Does the world need another OB-wheel-due-date-calculator app?  You bet!  OB Wheels combines three things that clinicians need to derive all the dates necessary in pregnancy care, and no other app has this combination.   \n\nIt contains a calendar calculator to determine EDD (EDC) from LMP or from a sonogram report.  The calendar calculator also provides gestational age (EGA) as of any date for a given EDD or LMP.  Because the calculator works off the real calendar, it is accurate for leap years too.\n\nThen for all of you who miss your cardboard OB wheel, the app contains one which you can rotate, pinch and zoom, and generally play with just like a regular cardboard wheel.  It's a little tricky to learn how to plant two fingers and rotate them rather than pinch-and-zoom to get rotation versus resizing.  But the wheel works and it is accurate, especially so because you can zoom in to be sure where the little date hash lines lie.\n\nFinally, the app notes the most recent committee opinion scheme from ACOG on how one might reconcile due dates from LMP and sonograms to arrive at a single final EDD.  To my knowledge, the scheme is authority-based and no better or worse than other schemes, but my practice and my learners need a single clear scheme, so this app includes one for easy reference.\n\nAs an educator and clinician myself, I am grateful for feedback.  Email me via the contact email at my website."

      "label": "Congratulations on your pregnancy! With this app we would like to give you a helpful tool, which will make food safety and good nutrition as simple as possible for you for the next nine months. What types of fish contain the least amount of mercury? Which types of cheese should you first strike off of your shopping list? And attending your next business lunch; what can you eat without worrying whether you’ll get toxoplasmosis? This app features a traffic light food labelling system of almost 1000 foodstuffs – they are categorized according to the level of danger to the unborn baby. Due to the background information and advice, you will feel more secure in the complex evaluation of the safety of unknown foods.\n\nHow the app works:\nAt first there is a theoretic part, which informs you in a nutshell about the most common foodborne diseases (toxoplasmosis, listeriosis, and salmonella.)\nThe core of the app is the food search. Here you can initially choose between an alphabetic or a filtered search. At first glance you can see whether a foodstuff is classified as green, orange or red.\nGreen-labelled food means that pregnant women can generally consume it safely - even if it is not necessarily healthy. Of course calories and nutritional value are another matter. On the same note, the permitted foods are always allowed in moderation. This applies especially to spices, herbs, and nuts. If you have a varied and balanced diet, you don't have to worry anymore. Orange let's you know that the safe consumption of the foodstuff depends on several factors (time of pregnancy, personal situation, the art of preparation, quantity, ...) But do not worry at first about the quantity of the orange entries, but do note the advice. Just click on the corresponding food label. You should absolutely avoid all red-labelled foodstuffs. They affect the development of your baby and damage it in the long-term.\n\nUsing the filtered search, however, you can adapt the list of the various risks and food categories to your individual situation. You can easily browse all accessible foods. Or you can filter through food categories and find out which cheese from your favorite camembert you can replace during the pregnancy.\n\nBy clicking the star you can finally add the desired food to your personal shopping list.\nBy the way, with the help of our hints and advice you will also get guidelines for specific food categories and several more ideas for everyday use. That way you can ensure even greater food safety without getting hysterical.\n\nWe wish you a relaxed pregnancy. All the best!\n\nKirstin & Roman"

      "label": "This application consists of three modules: RECORDER, SMART ALARM, STOP SNORING.\n\nRECORDER\nRecords your talk or snoring while you are asleep (automatic or manual sensitivity level, records only snoring using smart snoring detection), creates the graph of noise in room during the night, takes the total time of snoring down.\n\nSMART ALARM\nHelps you wake up easy in your lightest sleep phase and allows you to get up relaxed every morning. Improve your sleep naturally, maximize your sleep efficiency. \n\nSTOP SNORING\nTries to stop your snoring by playing chosen sound or using iPhone vibration when the snoring is detected.\n\nBy using the tracker data and by defining your own factors (activities/means/drugs/custom notes) it is possible to find out which facts influence your sleep positively and limit your snoring. At your disposal there are beautiful statistic charts for simple and efficient analyzing of your sleeps/nights.\n\nSnoring detection is based on artificial intelligence (A.I.) with the support of a new Apple machine learning technology. By using a large number of snoring samples, we can achieve high accuracy in statistics and in snoring detection itself.\n\nHow to place your device correctly is shown in instructions. \n\n\nHIGHLIGHTS:\n\n- ADJUSTABLE RECORDING SOUND SENSITIVITY:\nFor different sound conditions in your room (a quiet or loud environment).\n\n- HIGH TECH SNORING DETECTION:\nAccurate snoring detection based on A.I.\n\n- POSSIBILITY OF RECORDING ONLY SNORING\n\n- AUDIO VISUALIZATION DURING RECORDING OR PLAYING\n\n- FAVORITE RECORDINGS\n\n- SHARING RECORDINGS WITH YOUR FRIENDS:\nSend recordings via email, iMessage or post to Facebook\n\n- UNLIMITED ALARMS: \nSet your own alarms, daily alarms, weekly alarms, etc. You can use included alarm sounds or your own iPod music.\n\n- SMART WAKE UP: \nWake you up with gradual alarm when you are in your lightest sleep phase (based on your movements).\n\n- SLEEP TRACKER:\nSleep cycle analyzes and statistics with complete history and beautiful charts.\n\n- SNOOZE BY SHAKING:\nNo need to unlock screen or enter password.\n\n- STOP SNORING:\nPossibility of playing chosen sound or using iPhone vibration when the snoring is detected. \n\n- FACTORS, WAKE UP MOOD, NOTES:\nUser can place factors (alcohol, coffee, stress etc.) to every night as well as the mood after waking up or users own notes.\n\n- ACTIVATION DELAY:\nStart monitoring after a period of time.\n\n- BACKGROUND MODE:\nMonitoring runs also in background mode. Alarm also fires from background.\n\n- APPLE HEALTH INTEGRATION\n\n- iCLOUD SYNCHRONIZATION:\nSynchronization among your devices and between free and paid version.\n\n- EXPORTING HISTORY TO CSV FILE\n\n- APPLE WATCH:\nTracks your sleep movements and plays haptic (sound, vibration) if alarm is triggered or snoring is detected.\n\n\nCUSTOMER SUPPORT\nHappy customers are our highest priority. If you have a problem with our app, please contact us at stopsnoring4@apirox.com.\n\n\nSUBSCRIPTION INFORMATION\nYour payment will be charged to your iTunes Account as soon as you confirm your purchase.

This simple tool lets you report adverse effects to medicines, keep track of previously reported information and receive official news and alerts about medicines you are taking or interested in. \n \nWhy use the app?\n \n• Quick and easy to report adverse effects\n• Instant access to medicines safety information\n• Help make medicines safer for all\n• It’s free!\n \nKey features of the app\n \n• Submit reports on adverse effects even while offline\n• View and submit updates to previously submitted reports\n• See immediate acceptance of your reports\n• Create a ‘watch list’ of medications to receive personalised news and alerts\n \nWhy does it matter?\n \nMedicines are developed to be as safe and effective as possible, but they can still cause side effects. It is important for people to report adverse effects to medicines as this information can be used to identify previously unknown issues with those medicines.\n \nAdverse effects sometimes stop patients from completing their treatment, which can lead to even more serious problems. Reporting adverse effects encourages a dialogue between patients and healthcare professionals and helps professionals to identify and investigate unknown or poorly described adverse effects.\n \nThe Med Safety app has been developed as part of the WEB-RADR project. WEB-RADR is supported by the Innovative Medicines Initiative Joint Undertaking (IMI JU) under grant agreement n° 115632, resources of which are composed of financial contribution from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) and EFPIA companies’ in kind contribution."

Make and receive referrals for more than 40 specialities, including Orthopaedics, Burns, General Surgery, Dermatology, Emergency Medicine and Ophthalmology. We offer a secure, HIPAA compliant, environment to help  healthcare workers in urban and rural spaces connect with specialist centres quickly and efficiently. We aim to strengthen the referral and communication networks that already exist, to save everyone time, and to help ensure that patients get the right care when they need it. \n\nFor specialists:\n\n- Get quality referrals with the clinical information you need to decide whether to see the patient or provide remote consultation advice in an async manner that works around your current work demands.\n- Send and receive images (images are compressed to reduce data usage).\n- Say when you’re on call or off duty.\n- Receive unique sound notification when a new referral comes in and attend to it when you’re not busy with a patient.\n- Engage with the referring healthcare worker through a private chat discussion to get more photos and general information.\n- Make a well-informed decision and filter patient transfers before they arrive.\n- Archive the case when you’ve seen the patient: remove the information off all phones and only keeps it on a secure server.\n\nFor primary healthcare workers:\n\n- Reach out to the on-call specialist for your area, in a structured and monitored safe environment to get the skill support you need for each patient you see\n- Save time! Referrals go to the person on call at your referral hospital, so you don’t need to phone around to find out who that is."

The app will help to track your contractions and determine when it's time to go to the hospital.\nIf you plan on having a home birth, the app will tell you what stage of labor you are in at any given moment.\n\nKeep track of your labor by tapping a single button at the start and at the end of each contraction. The Contraction Timer analyzes the duration and frequency of contractions and will notify you when it's time to go to the hospital.\n\nThousands of pregnant women around the world have become mothers using our app.\n\nAlways consult your doctor to orient yourself in terms of contraction frequency and duration.\nThis app is not a medical device and our recomendations are based on standard indicators. Your labor may occur differently. Therefore, do not rely exclusively on our app.\nIf the duration and frequency of contractions do not yet correspond to the necessary indicators but labor pains become unbearable, it is better to go to the hospital as soon as possible rather than give birth at home or on the way there. Trust what your body is telling you.\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, please email us at neumandev@gmail.com. Your feedback is very important to us."

      "label": "Does the world need another OB-wheel-due-date-calculator app?  You bet!  OB Wheels combines three things that clinicians need to derive all the dates necessary in pregnancy care, and no other app has this combination.   \n\nIt contains a calendar calculator to determine EDD (EDC) from LMP or from a sonogram report.  The calendar calculator also provides gestational age (EGA) as of any date for a given EDD or LMP.  Because the calculator works off the real calendar, it is accurate for leap years too.\n\nThen for all of you who miss your cardboard OB wheel, the app contains one which you can rotate, pinch and zoom, and generally play with just like a regular cardboard wheel.  It's a little tricky to learn how to plant two fingers and rotate them rather than pinch-and-zoom to get rotation versus resizing.  But the wheel works and it is accurate, especially so because you can zoom in to be sure where the little date hash lines lie.\n\nFinally, the app notes the most recent committee opinion scheme from ACOG on how one might reconcile due dates from LMP and sonograms to arrive at a single final EDD.  To my knowledge, the scheme is authority-based and no better or worse than other schemes, but my practice and my learners need a single clear scheme, so this app includes one for easy reference.\n\nAs an educator and clinician myself, I am grateful for feedback.  Email me via the contact email at my website."

But it’s based only on the widely-spread theory by Landrum Shettles. The application also supports the scientific baby gender prediction method. It’s based on the scientific research by Rodrigo Guerrero and the statistics of thousands of women.\n\nYou can change the gender prediction method on the “Settings” screen. But remember that either gender prediction method shows only slightly higher chances of conceiving a girl or a boy and it never guarantees the result.\n\n* Full Version *\n\nThis is the full version of the application. You will be able to see the following data:\n\n- The probability of getting pregnant on the current or on any selected day.\n- The probability of conceiving a girl or a boy using the selected gender prediction method.\n- Chances of getting pregnant during the current period.\n- Chances of conceiving a girl or a boy during the current period.\n\n* How to Use *\n\nTo generate the menstrual calendar you have to provide the following data:\n\n- The first day of the last cycle (select the day and use the button “Add”).\n- Average length of the menstrual cycle (adjust it on the “Settings” screen).\n- Length of the luteal phase (most women can use the default value).\n\nThe application works best for women with regular menstrual cycle. But average cycle length is also a good way to predict when the ovulation should happen."

Through this privileged partnership, in which social, health and environmental issues come together, Virbac contributes, day after day, to shape the future of animal health. \nThe BackHome App embraces the company’s philosophy using the latest 21st century platforms to  provide services to its customers.\nThe BackHome app allows Veterinarians, Pet Owners and Welfare Organisations mobile access to the national database of registered microchips assuring pet owners that if their pets are lost, there is a national resource in place to help them be reunited with their pets as quickly and safely as possible. \nThe BackHome app allows users to look up microchip numbers should a lost pet be found to find the owner and to reunite the pet with its owner. The app enables Vets, Owners and Welfare Organisations to register pets on the national database and store contact information. Pet Owners can keep their pet information updated in an easy to use interface with some added features too. For example, if you are going on holiday, you can create temporary addresses. \nRegistering pets and keeping their information updated is one of the most important things people can do for the welfare of their pets. The BackHome app lets you do that – but it goes beyond that too allowing owners to store other pet information."

      "label": "Healthcare professionals and patients should use this application to search for potential drug-drug interactions between anti-HIV drugs and other medications, as recommended by international treatment guidelines. Results are presented as a “Traffic Light” system (red, amber, yellow and green) to indicate the recommendation. A brief summary of each interaction is given along with a grading of the quality of evidence (very low, low, moderate, high). The application is available free of charge and has been developed by the Liverpool Drug Interactions Group at the University of Liverpool and Clubzap Ltd. \n\nRequirements:\nThis is an “offline” application that is downloaded to your device. An internet connection is not required to use the application, but is needed for downloading updates.\n\nWhy this application may be useful:\nIn HIV therapy, patients take more than one HIV medication at a time and possibly other drugs to treat co-existing conditions. Many of the drug combinations have the potential to interact and this can affect either the patient's safety or the effectiveness of treatment. For this reason some drug combinations should not be given at all, while other drugs may be used together with caution, possibly requiring adjustments to dosage or time of administration. This application is a guide to interactions that may occur between different anti-HIV drugs and other medications that the HIV-infected patient may be prescribed. The application is regularly updated as new data emerge.  Full details about the interactions can be found at www.hiv-druginteractions.org."

      "label": "My Baby Heart Sounds is a quick and easy way to use your iPhone to listen, record and share your baby's heart sounds.\n\nNot too long ago, we were pregnant mothers too. While our partners enjoyed listening to our babies' sounds by placing their ears on the tummy, we wanted to capture and share these precious audio-memories ourselves. We tried voice memo apps and other sound-recording apps but felt that there was something more we could do to improve the quality of the sound in a simple setup. Fast forward a couple years and here we are!\n\nWhy should you try this app?\n- Minimum time to setup. All you need is your iPhone. Simple instructions are provided within the app and we are here to support you all the way.\n- High quality sound. Using advanced audio signal processing techniques, we deliver a high quality audio experience that allows you to distinguish your baby's heart sounds. For best results use AirPods.\n- Listen for free and only pay when you want to record and share.\n- Secure. All recordings are stored on your phone. We do not have any access to your recordings. You decide how you would like to share your recordings.\n\nFree version:\nWith the free version, listen to your baby's heart sounds unlimited number of times. When you are satisfied, you can purchase a premium version that allows you to record and share unlimited audio recordings of special moments and memories.\n\nOne time in-app purchase:\n- Features included in Free version.\n- Create unlimited audio recordings of special moments and memories. This feature requires a one time in app purchase. \n- Tag locations to remember and visualize where your chances are best for the next time you would like to hear your baby's heart sound.\n- When you would like to share the recording, multiple options are provided that include email, text and other social media apps. \n- Store the recording outside the app on your device or external storage apps.\n\nFor best results:\n- Use the app when you are 20-30 weeks or greater pregnant.\n- Use the app in a quiet room\n- Remove any phone case/shell/cover (the iPhone needs to touch your skin to be able to pick up the sounds)\n- Put the phone in Airplane Mode\n- Start the app and place the iPhone on your tummy to listen for a clear sound. You may need to try a few different spots. Press \"Record\" to create a recording\n- Use AirPods\n\nMy Baby Heart Sounds Disclaimer:\n- The My Baby Heart Sounds app is NOT a Medical Device or application. It is NOT in any way suitable for medical opinion, advice or diagnosis, and it is NOT intended to provide any information about the person of use's wellbeing or health.\n- The app does NOT backup recordings automatically outside the user's device. It is the user's responsibility to regularly backup their recordings."

      "label": "Blood pressure monitor & heart rate tracker app - Our application does not measure blood pressure. The app allows you to track it. For measurement use, FDA-approved blood pressure monitors.\n\nApp Main Features:\n \n- Modern and user-friendly interface\n- High blood pressure control\n- Clear graphs\n- Measurement history\n- Reminders and notifications\n\nBlood Pressure Levels:\n\nNormal: Systolic 90-119 and Diastolic 60-79\nHypotension: Systolic 90 and less or Diastolic 60 and less\nElevated: Systolic 120-129 and Diastolic 60-80\nHypertension - Stage 1: Systolic 130-139 or Diastolic 80-90\nHypertension - Stage 2: Systolic 140-180 or Diastolic 90-120\nHypertensive: Systolic 180 and higher or Diastolic 120 and higher\n\nAging Adults:\n\nIn adults, systolic blood pressure rises from early adulthood onward, up to at least age 70. Diastolic pressure tends to begin to rise at the same time but starts to fall earlier in mid-life, approximately age 55. Mean blood pressure rises from early adulthood, plateauing in mid-life, while pulse pressure rises quite markedly after the age of 40.\n\nConsequently, in many older people, systolic blood pressure often exceeds the normal adult range. The rise in pulse pressure with age is attributed to increased stiffness of the arteries.\n\nStay healthy!"

You can also directly sync with the No.1 snoring tracking app - SnoreLab - to track your progress.\n\nOne of the main causes of snoring is weak muscles in the mouth area. SnoreGym is an exercise app which helps to tone your upper airway muscles to reduce snoring.\n\nSnoreGym will guide you through a set of clinically-proven exercises for your tongue, soft palate, cheeks and jaw.\n\nFeatures include:\n- Exercises to reduce snoring\n- Easy-to-follow animations\n- Clear and detailed instructions\n- Evidence-based workouts\n- Progress tracking\n- Sync to SnoreLab\n\nScientists have tested a set of mouth exercises which tone muscles in the tongue, soft palate, throat, cheeks and jaw. This research has shown that mouth exercises can reduce snoring, decrease the severity of sleep apnea, reduce disturbance of bed partners and produce better sleep and quality of life.\n\nIt is important to do these exercises regularly to reduce your snoring. We recommend at least 10 minutes a day for 8+ weeks.\n\nExercise now for quieter sleep!"

The increase in insulin may result in low blood sugar levels (hypoglycemia) and hunger, which tends to lead to consuming excess calories and gaining weight.\n\nThis app is ideal for people with type two diabetes who want to control their blood glucose levels by changing their diet. Also, this app will become an essential tool for those who are struggling with excess weight and want to lose weight by starting a low-carb diet.\n\nNow with this app, monitoring your diet and eating healthy and nutritious food has become much easier! Just search the food and find out if it is good or   bad to consume.\n\nWe sincerely hope that this app will make you a healthier person!"

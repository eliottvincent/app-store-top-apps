If all of your family members install the iMapp application, you will be able to know not only their current geolocation, but also the places in which they have visited during the past 60 days.\n\nInstall iMapp and you will be able to:\n\n• track the location of your friends and relatives connected to the service \n• find out the location of any person; regardless of whether they have the app on their device installed (targeted devices should support HTML5)\n• view the time list of location(s) of your friends for last 60 days\n• get notifications when your friends arrive or leave from the places that you have created\n• control the battery level of your friends and family's phones\n• get directions to your friends, events, or any other places that you wish\n• create your own places on the map\n• share your location with your favorite friends in automatic mode\n• use the program for tracking locations of children and relatives\n• send the coordinates of a selected location using the most convenient way\n• use the most energy-saving technology of location tracking.\n\nThe accuracy of coordinates whilst searching for devices using phone number or email depends on the availability of built-in GPS/GSM/WiFi modules on the targeted devices. In the case that there is no GPS, the coordinates are detected according to the data of cellular networks, with the accuracy ranging from 100 to 1000m. If there is no GPS and GSM, then the coordinates are detected via IP address. This function works by sending a unique message - that the app generates - to the phone number supplied which contains the location. The message will be opened every time when you want to update the person's location.\n\nIf you are involved in confidential matters, you may change your status in iMapp so that your mark is displayed only to your favorite friends; or you can make yourself invisible.\n\niMapp has the following subscriptions:\n\niMapp Premium - $4.99/mo, $39.99/yr\niMapp PRO - $9.99/mo, $59.99/yr\nWith Premium, you will be able to connect any number of devices to the iMapp service. This allows you to track connected devices via PC, locate persons using a cell phone and also access 24/7 support. With the PRO version, you get all the features of Premium as well as unlimited moving logs of all your friends and relatives. Premium and PRO yearly subscriptions come with a free 3 day trial. When the trial expires, the subscription will auto-renew on a monthly or yearly basis. You will receive your first charge 3 days after starting your trial. The subscription costs will be charged from your score, linked through an iTunes account. Your subscription will be automatically renewed at regular intervals, according to what you selected, if you do not cancel it earlier than 24 hours before the end of the current period. You will not be able to unsubscribe after you have purchase it. Subscription changes are available in the Settings of your iTunes account after purchase.\n\nSolicited access:\n- to the camera and photo - to install the avatar\n- to contacts - to invite friends\n- to geo-position, including the background mode - to find the devices location\n- to push notifications - to send chat notifications\n\nGet acquainted to the Terms of Use you can on the link below: \nhttp://imap-app.com/Terms.html\nhttp://imap-app.com/privacypolicy.html\n\nNOTE: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease the battery life of the phone"

      "label": "Map, Track, Sync and Share Your Trek From Anywhere\n\nFor adventure seekers, explorers and outdoor enthusiasts, the Garmin Explore ecosystem offers a complete mobile navigation solution that  — when paired with a compatible Garmin device¹ — lets you map, track and navigate your trek from anywhere with unlimited cloud storage.\n\nGarmin Explore provides basic trip planning or viewing of maps you’ve preloaded on your device. Or you can use the mobile app to pair your smart device via BLUETOOTH®² technology with a compatible Garmin GPS device, so you can do and see even more.\n\nAccess Online Connectivity \n\nGarmin Explore provides free online access to a wide range of additional capabilities. For example, you can download detailed topographic maps, color aerial imagery and other navigation aids directly to your mobile device. The maps and navigation data loaded onto your device can be used anywhere, anytime — even when you’re out beyond the reach of cellphone towers or internet connections.\n\nManage Your Collections, Tracks and Routes\n\nReview and edit your waypoints, tracks, routes and activities in your library. Add them to a collection to keep all the recorded data from a certain trip together in one place. For example, if you’re taking a long trip, you can plan different waypoints, tracks and routes for each day of the trip and combine them into one collection.\n\nYour Mobile Cloud Connection\r\n\nThe Garmin Explore app will send and store the waypoints, planned routes, GPS tracks and Garmin activities you've recorded in the cloud, allowing you to access and use that data on the Garmin Explore web site to plan or review your adventures. You can also sync your cloud-stored data with a compatible Garmin device. A Garmin account is needed to store your data in the cloud. Your activities (e.g., runs, walks, hikes, etc.) include data such as distance, pace, activity time, location, etc. that were recorded by your device.\r\n\nMore Off-grid Capability with inReach® Technology\n\nUse Garmin Explore with your inReach enabled devices, such as the GPSMAP® 66i navigator and satellite communicator, to turn your mobile device into a true off-the-grid satellite companion. In an emergency, you can trigger an interactive SOS to the GEOS 24/7 emergency response team. Two-way messaging and LiveTrack location tracking via the 100% global Iridium® satellite network let you stay in contact globally. The Garmin Explore app allows you to access your phone’s contact list for easier messaging and sharing when connected.\n\nWhat You Get with Garmin Explore\n\n• Unlimited map downloads; access topographic maps, USGS quad sheets and more\n• Aerial imagery\n• Waypoints, tracking and route navigation\n• High-detail GPS trip logging and location sharing\n• Unlimited cloud storage of routes, waypoints, tracks, and activities\n• Online trip planning\n\n1. https://explore.garmin.com/appcompatibility\n\n2.

Choose the people you trust to see your location when needed.\n- Share your GPS location privately. Only your Guardians will be able to see where you are and check on your safety.\n- Notify your Guardians immediately when you are feeling unsafe, using the Emergency Sharing feature\n- Setup forever sharing. You can choose to share your location permanently to certain trusted people.\n- Battery life, network strength and phone status can also be shared. This can be vital information for your Guardians and your safety."

Trace over the incorrect segment to edit, or use the eraser tool.\n• Turn off snap to roads (magnet icon) and zoom in to manually trace the map. (Try switching to a satellite layer).\n• Displaying maps and continuously running GPS in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. Navigate without maps or with the screen off for all day battery life.\n\n\nCONTACT US\nWe've got a lot planned for Footpath.

      "label": "Ship Finder shows live moving ships on a worldwide map.\nYou can even use Augmented Reality (AR) view to identify ships out at sea using your device camera. \n\nShip Finder has been top rated and top ranking since 2009 and covers most of the world, tracking 20,000+ ships simultaneously.\n\nOur incredible app performance means that you can see all tracked vessels at once - no clustering here!\nSimply tap on a ship to see it's name, type and destination. Colour coded icons make identification easy too.\n\nIf you like this app you'll love the full version of Ship Finder.\n\nThe full version includes a huge array of additional features including route history, search, filters, bookmarks, photos, the ability to add favourite ships and much more.\n\nShip Finder works by picking up AIS ship feeds used by all passenger vessels, vessels over 300 tons and increasingly by smaller pleasure craft and yachts. This technology is actually faster than radar and is used by vessels for safety and navigation.\n\nShip Finder provides near real time “virtual radar” AIS maps. It’s easy to use and is an amazing app for anyone interested in shipping, cruising and sailing in ports and locations across the world. It’s also great if you simply want to know what boats are out there or want to see where your friends and family are. Ship Finder is also used extensively by maritime professionals and mariners.\n\nOur global AIS coverage is impressive and expanding all of the time as we add new AIS feeds and receivers. Please check www.shipfinder.co regularly to see the latest coverage.\n\nPinkfroot are committed to customer service and continually improve our Ship Finder apps based on feedback. Why not join our online community at www.pinkfroot.com or if you have any questions please email us via support@pinkfroot.com and we’ll be happy to help. \n\nDisclaimer: Ship Finder should not be used for navigational purposes. \nUnder no circumstances will the developer of this application be held responsible for incidents resulting from the use of the data or its interpretation."

With worldwide built-in map coverage, the ocean is the limit. Traffic awareness features allow you to stay safe and sail safely whether you're entering a busy shipping lane or sailing in the middle of the Pacific without Internet connectivity.\n\nDeveloped and tested on a real sailing vessel, OceanTrack makes use of a combination of the device's internal GPS and Compass sensors to provide instant data on current position, speed over ground, course and heading, plotted on a stylish navigation Display.\n\nWith Cloud AIS, providing you have Internet connectivity and there is land AIS coverage, OceanTrack comes with complimentary AIS information data with thousands of ships sailing around the world at any given moment. See ships anywhere and tap on them to discover who they are, how far they are or where they're going.\n\nThrough NMEA, OceanTrack can also connect to your boat's systems via an NMEA-to-WiFi bridge / server, collect real-time data from multiple onboard sensors, AIS receivers, and display accurate information on position, boat speed, depth below keel, wind speed and direction and surrounding marine traffic amongst other things.\n\nOceanTrack includes an advanced Multi Function Display and Map (MFD) with:\n\n- GPS Position Information\n- Speed Over Ground, Course Over Ground, Heading\n- Speed over Water, Depth Below Keel\n- Apparent and True Wind Speed and Direction\n- Beaufort Scale Estimation on screen\n- DTW, BTW, XTE and VMG when next waypoint is available\n- Dynamic zoomable range\n- Built-in moving map for use when offline and offshore; the whole world is included, no need to download it\n- Support for AIS-SART, AIS-MOB and AIS-EPIRB devices, plotting Man Overboard (MOB) positions on screen with relative bearing, distance and time to reach - a life saver!\n- Plotting of AIS targets including ships, navigation aids, shore stations and Search and Rescue (SAR) aircrafts\n- On-Map measurement of range, bearing and ETE at current speed to any point\n- Quick multi-hop tap-hold-and-drag route planning anywhere in the world \n- AIS info including Name, MMSI, SOG, COG, RNG, BRG\n- AIS directed and broadcast messages display and alerts\n- Advanced calculation of CPA and TCPA to any AIS ship\n- Selection of rhumb-line (loxodromic) or great-circle (orthodromic) navigation\n- Mercator Projection\n- Various unit selections and display formats\n- Portrait and Landscape orientations on iPad\naccess to onboard instruments with:\n\n- An NMEA decoder to interface with onboard AIS receivers \n- NMEA on TCP and UDP interfaces\n- NMEA support for VDM, RMC, GSA, GSV, GLL, VTG, GGA, HDT, HDG, VHW, DBT, DPT, MWV, MTW and RMB sentences\n\nand an AIS engine with:\n\n- List of all surrounding AIS vessels sorted by distance\n- Detailed AIS information on vessels including all static and dynamic performance indicators (MMSI, position, SOG, COG, country, dimensions, ...) \n\nRequirements:\n\nOceanTrack is iOS only and universal for any iPad, iPhone and iPod touch running iOS 9.0 or later. \n\nTo access onboard instruments and surrounding AIS traffic (other than cloud AIS which has limited coverage and requires Internet connectivity), OceanTrack requires a WiFi network, an NMEA to WiFi server and the NMEA Connector inApp purchase. Most modern plotters provide this bridging and WiFi funcionality nowadays but should they not, NMEA to WiFi adapters can usually be installed separately to provide access."

If all of your family members install the iMapp application, you will be able to know not only their current geolocation, but also the places in which they have visited during the past 60 days.\n\nInstall iMapp and you will be able to:\n\n• track the location of your friends and relatives connected to the service \n• find out the location of any person; regardless of whether they have the app on their device installed (targeted devices should support HTML5)\n• view the time list of location(s) of your friends for last 60 days\n• get notifications when your friends arrive or leave from the places that you have created\n• control the battery level of your friends and family's phones\n• get directions to your friends, events, or any other places that you wish\n• create your own places on the map\n• share your location with your favorite friends in automatic mode\n• use the program for tracking locations of children and relatives\n• send the coordinates of a selected location using the most convenient way\n• use the most energy-saving technology of location tracking.\n\nThe accuracy of coordinates whilst searching for devices using phone number or email depends on the availability of built-in GPS/GSM/WiFi modules on the targeted devices. In the case that there is no GPS, the coordinates are detected according to the data of cellular networks, with the accuracy ranging from 100 to 1000m. If there is no GPS and GSM, then the coordinates are detected via IP address. This function works by sending a unique message - that the app generates - to the phone number supplied which contains the location. The message will be opened every time when you want to update the person's location.\n\nIf you are involved in confidential matters, you may change your status in iMapp so that your mark is displayed only to your favorite friends; or you can make yourself invisible.\n\niMapp has the following subscriptions:\n\niMapp Premium - $4.99/mo, $39.99/yr\niMapp PRO - $9.99/mo, $59.99/yr\nWith Premium, you will be able to connect any number of devices to the iMapp service. This allows you to track connected devices via PC, locate persons using a cell phone and also access 24/7 support. With the PRO version, you get all the features of Premium as well as unlimited moving logs of all your friends and relatives. Premium and PRO yearly subscriptions come with a free 3 day trial. When the trial expires, the subscription will auto-renew on a monthly or yearly basis. You will receive your first charge 3 days after starting your trial. The subscription costs will be charged from your score, linked through an iTunes account. Your subscription will be automatically renewed at regular intervals, according to what you selected, if you do not cancel it earlier than 24 hours before the end of the current period. You will not be able to unsubscribe after you have purchase it. Subscription changes are available in the Settings of your iTunes account after purchase.\n\nSolicited access:\n- to the camera and photo - to install the avatar\n- to contacts - to invite friends\n- to geo-position, including the background mode - to find the devices location\n- to push notifications - to send chat notifications\n\nGet acquainted to the Terms of Use you can on the link below: \nhttp://imap-app.com/Terms.html\nhttp://imap-app.com/privacypolicy.html\n\nNOTE: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease the battery life of the phone"

      "label": "Map, Track, Sync and Share Your Trek From Anywhere\n\nFor adventure seekers, explorers and outdoor enthusiasts, the Garmin Explore ecosystem offers a complete mobile navigation solution that  — when paired with a compatible Garmin device¹ — lets you map, track and navigate your trek from anywhere with unlimited cloud storage.\n\nGarmin Explore provides basic trip planning or viewing of maps you’ve preloaded on your device. Or you can use the mobile app to pair your smart device via BLUETOOTH®² technology with a compatible Garmin GPS device, so you can do and see even more.\n\nAccess Online Connectivity \n\nGarmin Explore provides free online access to a wide range of additional capabilities. For example, you can download detailed topographic maps, color aerial imagery and other navigation aids directly to your mobile device. The maps and navigation data loaded onto your device can be used anywhere, anytime — even when you’re out beyond the reach of cellphone towers or internet connections.\n\nManage Your Collections, Tracks and Routes\n\nReview and edit your waypoints, tracks, routes and activities in your library. Add them to a collection to keep all the recorded data from a certain trip together in one place. For example, if you’re taking a long trip, you can plan different waypoints, tracks and routes for each day of the trip and combine them into one collection.\n\nYour Mobile Cloud Connection\r\n\nThe Garmin Explore app will send and store the waypoints, planned routes, GPS tracks and Garmin activities you've recorded in the cloud, allowing you to access and use that data on the Garmin Explore web site to plan or review your adventures. You can also sync your cloud-stored data with a compatible Garmin device. A Garmin account is needed to store your data in the cloud. Your activities (e.g., runs, walks, hikes, etc.) include data such as distance, pace, activity time, location, etc. that were recorded by your device.\r\n\nMore Off-grid Capability with inReach® Technology\n\nUse Garmin Explore with your inReach enabled devices, such as the GPSMAP® 66i navigator and satellite communicator, to turn your mobile device into a true off-the-grid satellite companion. In an emergency, you can trigger an interactive SOS to the GEOS 24/7 emergency response team. Two-way messaging and LiveTrack location tracking via the 100% global Iridium® satellite network let you stay in contact globally. The Garmin Explore app allows you to access your phone’s contact list for easier messaging and sharing when connected.\n\nWhat You Get with Garmin Explore\n\n• Unlimited map downloads; access topographic maps, USGS quad sheets and more\n• Aerial imagery\n• Waypoints, tracking and route navigation\n• High-detail GPS trip logging and location sharing\n• Unlimited cloud storage of routes, waypoints, tracks, and activities\n• Online trip planning\n\n1. https://explore.garmin.com/appcompatibility\n\n2.

It supports HTML 5 + CSS 3, and is based in Webkit. \n\nCroPlus gives you the power to take back control of your Web experience. That’s why we design CroPlus with the most secure and anonymous functionalities. Its main local features  are similar to our XFirePlus app, which are:\n\n- Local browser for quick navigation.\n- Search intelligence. \n- Bookmark management.\n- Caching to optimize the web browsing. \n- Visual Tabs to find content for future reference.\n- Open as many tabs as you like without losing track of your open Web pages.\n- Access to a Firefox running in a remote machine. Your Ip address will never be tracked.\n\nBut be aware that CroPlus includes a remote connection to a Cloud system from which you will be able to run a Midori web browser. As such, it inherits all the Midori functionalities. It supports many of the most popular parts of the web, including Google, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Spotify and Rdio."

Colour coded icons make identification easy too.\n\nIf you like this app you'll love the full version of Ship Finder.\n\nThe full version includes a huge array of additional features including route history, search, filters, bookmarks, photos, the ability to add favourite ships and much more.\n\nShip Finder works by picking up AIS ship feeds used by all passenger vessels, vessels over 300 tons and increasingly by smaller pleasure craft and yachts. This technology is actually faster than radar and is used by vessels for safety and navigation.\n\nShip Finder provides near real time “virtual radar” AIS maps. It’s easy to use and is an amazing app for anyone interested in shipping, cruising and sailing in ports and locations across the world. It’s also great if you simply want to know what boats are out there or want to see where your friends and family are. Ship Finder is also used extensively by maritime professionals and mariners.\n\nOur global AIS coverage is impressive and expanding all of the time as we add new AIS feeds and receivers. Please check www.shipfinder.co regularly to see the latest coverage.\n\nPinkfroot are committed to customer service and continually improve our Ship Finder apps based on feedback. Why not join our online community at www.pinkfroot.com or if you have any questions please email us via support@pinkfroot.com and we’ll be happy to help. \n\nDisclaimer: Ship Finder should not be used for navigational purposes. \nUnder no circumstances will the developer of this application be held responsible for incidents resulting from the use of the data or its interpretation."

Using the controls on the handlebar, the navigation, telephone and music features are at your fingertips at all times; you also have a continuous overview of the key data about your ride and your motorbike.\r\n\nKeep other riders up to date on your progress by sharing your routes, riding data and photos at the touch of a button with friends on social media or the Rever app.\r\n\r\nWe continuously develop our app for you – and we hope that you'll stay excited to discover its new functions. \r\nHere, you can find an overview of all the features the BMW Motorrad Connected app currently offers:\r\n\r\n#Route Planning.\r\n•\tPlan and save routes with waypoints\r\n•\tMotorbike-specific navigation with the \"winding route\" criteria\r\n•\tWeather information for your current location\r\n•\tImport and export routes (GPX files)\r\n•\tFree map downloads for offline use\r\n\r\n#Navigation.\r\n•\tMotorbike navigation suitable for every day\r\n•\tTFT display with arrow navigation (voice commands if a communication system is available)\r\n•\tLane recommendations\r\n•\tUp-to-date traffic information\r\n•\tSpeed limit display\r\n•\tPoint-of-interest search\r\n\r\n#Route Recording.\r\n•\tRecord travelled routes and vehicle data\r\n•\tAnalyse performance values such as banking angle, acceleration and engine speed\r\n•\tRoute export (GPX files)\r\n•\tShare recorded routes and photos on social media\r\n\r\n#Vehicle Data.\r\n•\tCurrent mileage\r\n•\tFuel level and remaining distance\r\n•\tTyre pressure(with RDC special equipment)\r\n•\tService requirements\r\n\r\nNotes for use.\r\n•\tThis app is part of BMW Motorrad Connectivity and can only actively be used when connected to a vehicle with a TFT display. The connection is established wirelessly between a smartphone, the vehicle and – if available – a communication system via Bluetooth; the app is operated using the multi-controller on the handlebar. We recommend using the BMW Motorrad communication system for listening to music, making telephone calls and receiving navigation instructions.\r\n•\tA mobile Internet connection is required to access traffic information. This may incur costs in line with the contract between the customer and their mobile provider (e.g. for roaming).\r\n•\tPlease note that the functionality of your smartphone and the connection to the vehicle also depend on national requirements and factors; BMW Motorrad therefore cannot guarantee that it will be available at all times.\r\n•\tThe BMW Motorrad Connected app will be displayed in the language you have set for your smartphone. Please note that not all languages are supported.\r\n•\tContinued use of GPS tracking in the background may reduce the battery life of your smartphone.\r\nMake Life a Ride."

      "label": "Airmate is a free and easy to use flight planning and weather app for pilots, including many social sharing features.\n\nThanks to Airmate flight planning form, you will get instant access to airport data and aviation maps, up to date weather and NOTAMs.\n\nIFR and VFR airport plates are freely available in US (FAA charts), Europe, and more than 200 other countries. Many of them are georeferenced and could be overlaid on the aviation chart. A powerful Plate Manager allows to download in advance all airport plates in a country, they could be easily printed and viewed.\n\nDuring the flight, the moving map will display the aircraft location along the route, show airports and aeronautical data details, warn you if your planned route is crossing restricted areas. A profile view is available to display terrain elevation, crossed areas and forecasted weather across the route. Airmate can also display a backup aircraft attitude indicator and flight parameters in an EFIS-like view using the device internal sensors or a supported external AHRS-capable ADS-B receiver or supported aircraft avionics. In the whole world, Synthetic Vision displaying in the EFIS-like view the ups and downs of rolling terrain ahead is available.\n\nAirmate includes a worldwide aeronautical database updated free of charge with airports, navigation beacons, waypoints, airways, obstacles, regulated and restricted areas. Topographic maps and elevation data for most countries may be downloaded free of charge, as well as additional aviation map overlays such US Sectionals. A procedure database provide details of departure (SID), arrival (STAR) and instrument approaches in the USA, and you could add those procedures to your planned flight route (the procedure database includes all US airports, we are workding to add airports in other countries). Once loaded, the procedure path is displayed on the aeronautical map, including curved paths and racetracks.\n\nWhen coupled with a supported external ADS-B received, Airmate will display nearby traffic on the moving map, and receive FIS-B weather and NOTAM during the flight. Airmate is able to transmit the flight plan data to supported avionics such Dynon SkyView.\n\nThanks to the Auto Route feature, you could search and select the best route for your flight, and then file your VFR or IFR flight plan (in the USA using your http://1800wxbrief.com account). Once filed, your flight plan could easily be managed, delayed or cancelled.\n\nAirmate will also record your flights and allow to replay them later or export the flight path in gpx format, you could take pictures from the app during flights. Pilot log entries are automatically computed from flown flights.\n\nA Satellite map display mode in flight planning or replay mode allows to familiarize with significant landmarks.\n\nAirmate will save planned and flown flights, user waypoints and user aircrafts in the cloud and sync them between your devices and Airmate web flight planning.\n\nAirmate brings numerous social features to the community. Pilots may leave ratings, tips and comments to share their experience with fellow pilots, and report fuel prices and handling fees. They could find friends, instructors, flight schools, aviation events and aircraft to rent near their home airport or any visited airport. A planned flight may be shared with other pilots by indicating the number of seats available for additional passengers.\n\nAirmate may be connected to most flight simulators to keep flying skills sharp, and will manage also AHRS and simulated traffic data transmitted by the flight simulator. Planned flights and personal waypoints may be imported and exported, including from/to flight simulators.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

When you go over a preset speed limit, the large digits change colour from green to red and the device emits a loud sound to alert you! Great for avoiding speeding tickets!\n\n‣ Easy to set and configurable speed limits \nSet speed limits with 4 fast and configurable presets. Presets only need a single tap and are the safest way to set the limits! \n\n‣ S.O.S. Flat tyre or worse? \nOur speedometer shows your current location and you can share it easily (sms/text, email) with car assistance services, ambulance or friends. \n\n‣ Know your car's limits ! \nDoes your car become sluggish on those steep climbs? Is it possible you got too high in mountains ? Our built-in altimeter will provide you with accurate readings that indicate your height over sea-level. \n\n‣ In a dispute for speeding?\nGPS Black box gives you point by point time, speed, location and altitude data for the last 20 minutes of your travel. You can email its data as an excel or csv file. Or you can surely switch it off or reset at any moment.\n\n‣ Need to know where you are?\nIntegrated map shows your location and a tracking \"tail\" behind you.\n\n∙∙ UNIVERSAL APP. Speedometer for iPhone and 3G-iPads. Retina graphics included. \n\n∙∙ 000-999 SPEED AND LIMIT RANGE. MPH, KMH AND KNOTS. Maximum, average speed, distance traveled. \n\n! You can use this app on your iPhone 3GS, 4, or 4S as well as on any iPad with 3G. **App will not work properly on iPods and wifi only iPads as they don't have GPS chip (External GPS module is required).\n! Please note that as with all GPS apps, continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. \n\nDrive safely and avoid paying those speeding fines! Our speedometer is the ideal watchdog companion no matter what journey you are going on!\n\nFull version of the speedometer gives you ability to work in background, GPS tracking, waypoints, trip cost computer, Siri shortcuts for applying speed limits and controlling track recording, 100+ customization options and more. Be sure to check it out in the AppStore!\n\n* A bit of instructions: If speedometer doesn't show you the speed, just be sure to be under the open sky to have GPS signal. Under the open sky, within 5-10 seconds GPS indicator will become green and speedometer will start showing the speed.\n** If you wonder why gps speedometer may show 3-5 mph (3-8 kmh) less than a car's speedometer, you can take a look here: http://goo.gl/wtLvT (tomtom's discussion thread).\n*** And here is an amazing article http://goo.gl/p5zfMi explaining why GPS might show you 80ft (or -80!) altitude when you are laying on the beach. Don't throw the app or iPhone away just because of that! :) Let us use the article's last sentence here: \"Those who use GPS altitude to aid in landing their small plane should have their insurance policies paid up at all times\"."

      "label": "Find your current elevation, altitude, and height above sea level easily with this altimeter/barometer app.\n\r\n\r\n\n## Elevation Finder ##\n\r\n\r\nThis app helps you observe the elevations of all locations on the surface of the earth by simply touch and move the map around, or input the address/location name. You can also find the elevation of your current location by using online database, built-in GPS, or barometer on your device.\n\r\n\r\n\nElevation data benefits flood prevention, prediction of water levels in rivers, lakes, and seas, etc. Thus, knowing the elevation of places is very crucial if you are looking for a flood-free house, or planning for a hiking trip, and more.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\n## Could-based Altitude Data ##\r\nThe easiest way to find altitude of any location on earth. By simply point on the screen, you can get the elevation data from a coordinate location point. “Range Mode” is available for altitude comparison (by graph and line) of each point between two selected locations. \n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## GPS Altitude Data ##\r\nUse built-in GPS on your device to determine the altitude of your current location. The altitude data of the area you walked-through will be recorded and displayed as a multicolored line on the map. The colors presented on the line indicate different heights. Precision indicators (horizontal resolution and vertical resolution) are displayed on the screen.\n\r\n\r\n\n## Barometric Altitude Data ##\r\nUse built-in barometer on your device to determine the elevation of your current location. You can either measure the elevation from raw barometric data, or relative pressure from sea-level. Like GPS data, the result is displayed as a multicolored line.\n\n\r\n\r\nTo get the most accurate data, it is recommended to adjust the sea level pressure and temperature prior to the measurement, and set the offset or calibration value if necessary. \n\r\n\r\n\n## Standalone Barometer ##\r\nYou can use this app as a standalone barometer.\n\r\n\r\n\n## Air Pressure / Altitude Calculator ##\r\nAtmospheric pressure and/or altitude at your current location are calculated from known altitude, pressure of the location, temperature and/or sea level pressure.\r\n\r\n\n## Support of Coordinate Formats ##\r\nThis app not only displays regular latitude and longitude data, but also supports many coordinate systems such as, Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinate system and Military Grid Reference System (MGRS) and more.\r\n\r\n## Export of Data ##\r\nFrom this app, you can export many useful information including timestamp, altitude, pressure, and coordinates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\nSubscription\n-------------\nElevation - Sea Level Map  is completely free to use with all features. You can subscribe to this application to remove ads and reduce data retrieving delay by 50%.\n\nDevice subscriptions are available in these plan and will renew automatically each month, six months or year, unless cancelled.\n\n(Per month) - $4.49\n(Per six-months) - $25.99\n(Per year) - $48.99\n\nPricing shown is for the United States store. Pricing in other stores will vary.\n\nPayment for subscriptions will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\n\nAccount will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period.

Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period at the same cost as your original purchase.\n\n\nTIPS FOR MAPPING ROUTES\n• For longer routes, try zooming in and mapping your route in multiple segments.\n• Tap and hold the map to quickly route between waypoints and POIs.\n• Did Footpath snap to the wrong roads? Trace over the incorrect segment to edit, or use the eraser tool.\n• Turn off snap to roads (magnet icon) and zoom in to manually trace the map. (Try switching to a satellite layer).\n• Displaying maps and continuously running GPS in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. Navigate without maps or with the screen off for all day battery life.\n\n\nCONTACT US\nWe've got a lot planned for Footpath.

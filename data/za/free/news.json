Maroela Media hou jou op hoogte van die jongste nuusgebeure en ons maak seker dat jy weet watter boeke om te lees, hoe om vanaand se kos gaar te maak en wie die rugby gaan wen. In ons Vermaak en Leefstyl-afdeling kan jy selfs uitsien na daai stories wat jou na jou asem gaan laat snak, jou tot trane gaan dryf of jou laat skaterlag van lekkerkry en plesier. Ons meningvormers gesels kopstukke in Die Groot Debat en ons gee vir jou agtergrond oor gebeure in Nuuskommentaar. \n\nOns is die nuusleser met die vreemde pruik, die soustannie met die lekker bak beskuit, die skeidsregter en die oom op die pawiljoen wat nartjies gooi. Ons is jou taaljuffrou en die pêl wat saam stokkies draai. Ons is jou ouma se sagte skouer en jou oom se blinknuwe motor. Skink vir jou 'n koppie boeretroos dan kuier jy lekker saam.\n\nKom kyk na die app en indien jy op enige kinkel in die kabel afkom, laat weet ons asseblief onmiddellik! Sonder jou bly ons app en ons hart gebroke."

The App allows you to customise notifications based on which games and days of the week you play. There is also the option to set notifications at times that suit you - great for reminding you to purchase tickets before the draw.\n\n\nRandom Number Generator\n-----------------------------\nStuck for numbers? Use this handy tool and let the app choose your numbers rather than having to rely on house numbers and anniversary dates!\n\n\nResults Archive\n----------------------------\nAccess to the full archive of results dating back to the first 49s draw.\n\n\nSupport\n----------------------------\nIf you have any feedback or suggestions on how we can improve this app, please get in touch at support@lottonumbers.com."

      "label": "Balanced News Summary is an unbiased news source self-funded and created by an independent Australian researcher. We offer multiple perspectives on the political spectrum for each particular topic so that you can read both sides and form your own opinion! We also offer short, unbiased news summaries to get you up to date with the news quickly and conveniently. Unbiased news summaries ensure you get the facts without the spin.\n\nApp Features:\n• No subscription fees, no intrusive ads, convenient and easy to use!\n• Get the complete picture by contrasting left (red), centre (purple), and right-leaning (blue) headlines to each other. If you want to avoid being misled by one-sided media, this is the most time-effective way.\n• Over 1,000 Australian and global news sources rated as left/centre-left/centre/centre-right/right bias.\n• Short, convenient unbiased news summaries on a wide range of topics – get the facts within 30 seconds!\n• Get today’s headlines across a wide range of topics, segmented by countries and categories. We provide live 24/7 updates in one convenient app on the following categories: Breaking News, Australia & New Zealand news, U.S. news, U.K. news, India news, Canada news, Europe news, Asia news, Latin America news, Middle East news, Africa news, World news, Business news, Politics news, Sport news, Entertainment & Arts news, Health news, Tech news, Environment news, Crime news, Activism news.\n• Access news from a variety of sources. The best news coverage from left, centre and right publications can be found right here – news aggregated from thousands of popular sources across the globe, such as ABC News, Sky News, SBS, NDTV, BBC, 9News, MSNBC, New York Times, News.com.au, The Guardian, The Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, Fox News, CNN and many more!\n• Factual News Search – use the customised Google search in this app to conduct research that only searches for highly factual news sources.\n• Summaries of thousands of articles!\n\nRecent trends show that trust in news is declining. A Roy Morgan survey in 2018 discovered that the second most mentioned reason for adult Australians avoiding the news was ‘I feel that news content is biased towards a particular ideology’. In a 2020 study by the University of Canberra, only 38% of respondents said they could trust Australian news. More recently, Dr Jennifer Oriel from The Australian reported that 67% of respondents in the Edelman Trust Barometer survey believe journalists “are purposely trying to mislead people by saying things they know are false or gross exaggerations”.\n\nAs a result, individuals are becoming less tolerant of opposing views, and communities are being divided based on political preference. Balanced News Summary hopes to break this trend by identifying bias and offering balanced analysis from both sides of the political spectrum.\n\nThe purpose of this app is to provide clarity and reunite communities. Balanced News Summary is intended for education and research and does not claim ownership of external websites shown. Every effort has been made to offer equal opinions from the left, centre, and the right.\n\nQuestions or feedback on the Balanced News Summary app?

Just create an account, go live directly from the app, and bring people together around whatever you’re passionate about. \nYou never know what you’ll find: Popular games are always live, but so are music festivals, rocket launches, street tours of Tokyo, and goat yoga. Yes, really. \nDark mode: Y’all love this one.

The creative potential unleashed by Focos is endless.\n\nThe Verge,\n\"Focos has long been one of the most ambitious photo-editing apps on iOS, turning any photo into a 'portrait mode'-style image with fully adjustable depth of field, no matter what kind of camera you took it with.\"\n\nMAIN FEATURES\n- Take photos with shallow depth of field, without manually painting or making selections.\n- The AI engine can calculate depth of field automatically for all photos.\n- True 3D imaging.\n- Simulate large apertures to create real bokeh effects normally only possible with DSLR cameras and expensive lenses.\n- Import all existing photos and customize the bokeh effect.\n- Re-focus portrait photos that have already been taken, with a simple tap.\n- Choose from various simulated aperture diaphragms to generate different bokeh spot effects.\n- Professional options to simulate lens characteristics, such as creamy, bilinear, swirly, and reflex effects, and more.\n- Visualize the depth of areas within your portrait photos in a 3D view, and intuitively add depth filters.\n- Add multiple lights in a 3D space, and adjust the color, brightness and so on for each light.\n- Check the portrait picture in the real world with augmented reality technique.\n- It is possible to patch the depth map precisely on iPad with Apple Pencil.\n- Intuitive and easy to use, with built-in video tutorials.\n- An essential tool for all iPhones and iPads.\n\nDo you have questions or suggestions?

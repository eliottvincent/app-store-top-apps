      "label": "BirdPro is the ultimate app for identifying and appreciating the birds of South Africa.\n\nYou can download and test the app for free with a limit sample of 100 birds, and when you are ready you can upgrade to bird of:\n- Southern Africa\n- South Africa\n- Kruger National Park\n- Namibia\n- Botswana\n- Zimbabwe\n- Mozambique\n\nYou can also purchase the Southern African version which includes all of the above.\n\nBirdPro boasts an award winning identification tool and has a vast source of information:\n- Over 7700 beautiful and diagnostic images from various angles and of all variants, e.g. immature, males, females, dark and light morphs\n- Over 2100 comprehensive and clear bird calls\n- Over 70 videos showing bird behaviour or Jizz\n- Informative and comprehensive information on each bird\n- Interactive and accurate bird distribution maps, even showing the migration patterns per month where applicable.\n- Names of birds in 16 languages, including most native South African languages as well as Scientific, German, French and Portuguese.\n\nThe SmartSearch function allows you to select your current, or any other location and the birds at that location will be filtered. Over and above the GPS location, you can search by shape, type, colours, size, where seen, bird calls and more. There are 100's of attributes you can choose from, which makes identifying a bird accurate and easy. As a first ever bird app achievement, the resulting bird list is sorted by relevance with the most probable birds matching your search criteria at the top, which makes it extremely quick and accurate. The ability to remove birds from the results is a game-changer. It even has a section for hard to  identify birds (LBJ's, etc)\n\nIn addition to the SmartSearch function, BirdPro contains the most accurate Image Recognition for South African birds. You can upload images from your device or take a photo with the device's camera, which will then be used for the Image Recognition. This function has a 2-week evaluation period.\n\nBirdPro also offers the most accurate location filter available. You can select current location, location from a map or any of over 1200 South African reserves.\n\nYou can also log your sightings with trip descriptions, date, photos and notes, which are then indicated as pins on the distribution maps. Sightings lists can be viewed and can even be synced to a website and shared between devices. \n\nBirdPro also offers a Similars functionality. It not only ranks the similars, it also gives preference to your location selection. When using a location filter, similars at that location will be ranked higher and similars outside of your selected location will be displayed last. Both these features are a first for any bird app!\n\nNo internet connectivity is required to operate the app after it is installed which makes it possible to use the app in the most remote locations.\n\nAll updates are regular and free. \nMajor functional additions, like Image Recognition, is charged for additionally."

The music that plays when you read the verses, the scrolling like flipping a page, and everything about it just makes my time with God feel very intimate when I am reading daily verses and able to go through some of the devotionals. Really grateful to have had this app shared with me, especially during everything going on right now, it couldn’t have been better timing. We have also shared it with our Dad who loves the app as well. I have used apps in the past such as the Bible app that is very well known and found that some of the devotionals included someone’s biased opinion instead of focusing on what God is saying to us in the Bible. This app and the Jesus Calling App are the only apps for Devotionals and Daily verses that I consistently use because I love them so much and deeply appreciate that they stick to what the Bible says and not someone’s own interpretation of it. Whoever designed this app did an incredible job! Thank you so much!\"\n\nReceive God's word daily through beautiful Holy Bible stories, verses, and music. Receive personal, relevant verses for inspiration and sharing with loved ones.  Each day a new verse is sent to your device - it's like receiving a message from a dear friend who loves you and wants you to be happy.  Join the #Bible movement, share the Word, and fill social media with grace.\n\nYou may use this app for free, but if you would be delighted to support our mission of delivering thousands of moments of grace, love, and wisdom each day, there are patronage subscriptions available. \n\nTerms of service: http://www.mindblownapp.com/terms\nPrivacy policy: http://www.mindblownapp.com/privacy"

      "label": "SKY TONIGHT is a brand-new astronomical app for exploring the sky. It helps stargazers answer the three most common questions:\n\n⁕ What is that bright dot in the sky?\n⁕ What astronomical events can I see tonight?\n⁕ How can I find the object I'm interested in?\n\nMade by the developers of Star Walk apps, Sky Tonight is a customizable stargazing tool, that is designed for users with different needs and wants. You can adjust the constellation's appearance, set a reminder for any space body configuration, explore the unique relative to observer trajectory, set up a magnitude limit to filter out space objects, and much more.\n\nSKY TONIGHT FEATURES:\n\n► Point your device at the sky to see the real-time positions of space objects on the interactive sky map.\n► Activate the Time Machine and determine the position of celestial bodies at different time periods.\n► Use the augmented reality mode and see the sky map overlaid on the image from your device's camera.\n► Get extended information about any sky object by tapping on its name.\n► Stay updated on the latest news from the world of astronomy with the What's new section.\n► Turn on the night mode to make your sky observation in the nighttime more comfortable.\n► Filter the objects that appear on the sky map according to their visual brightness.\n► Regulate the brightness of objects on the sky map.\n► Spot dozens of asterisms along with the official constellations. \n► Adjust the visible constellations and customize their representation on the screen.\n\nUNIQUE FEATURES:\n\n◆ INTERACTIVE TRAJECTORIES RELATIVE TO AN OBSERVER\nInstead of the classic trajectory that shows the object’s trajectory in the celestial sphere relative to the Earth’s center, the app presents the object’s trajectory in the sky relative to an observer. A long touch on the trajectories relative to the observer will move the sky object to the selected point. While holding the touch, move your finger along the trajectory to change the time.\n\n◆ FLEXIBLE SEARCH\nMake use of the flexible search — quickly find space objects, easily navigate across different objects and events’ types. Look for \"stars\", \"mars moons\", \"mars conjunctions\", \"solar eclipse\", and the app will show you all related objects, events, and articles!\nThere are also Trending and Recent categories in the search section. The first one presents the currently most popular objects, events, or news; the second category contains objects you recently selected. \n\n◆ FULLY CUSTOMIZABLE EVENT REMINDERS\nSet event reminders on any time and date not to miss a solar eclipse, a Full Moon, or a star-planet configuration you're interested in.\n\n◆ ASTRONOMY CALENDAR WITH A STARGAZING INDEX AND WEATHER FORECAST\nCheck out the calendar of celestial events that includes lunar phases, meteor showers, eclipses, oppositions, conjunctions, and other exciting events. Learn what astronomy events will occur this month or see what happened in the sky a year ago!\nVerify the Stargazing Index calculated from a Moon phase, light pollution, cloudiness, and time when an object is visible. The higher this index is, the better the observation conditions are.\n\nYou don’t need several apps for your stargazing planning anymore; Sky Tonight contains all the info you need.\n\nPremium Access:\n\n* The app includes paid Premium Access. Get Premium Access to use Sky Tonight with no limits! Without the subscription, you can’t see most of the interface items in various sections such as Visible Tonight, Calendar, and Search. Therefore, you’re limited in planning and improving your observations. Premium Access will allow you to unlock all the interface items in any view and make the most of all the app’s features. Advertisements will also be removed not to interrupt your stargazing experience.\n\nPrivacy policy: https://vitotechnology.com/privacy-policy\nTerms of use: https://vitotechnology.com/terms-of-use"

      "label": "Welcome to the most detailed travel guide for overland travel in Africa. This offline app offers a great map and huge amount of detailed places of interest for planning your next safari. Your GPS location will ensure you stay orientated while using the app on your self-drive trip.\n\nTry it out\n\nThe app contains samples of the map and guide information, which can be upgraded to full country maps and guides.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nThis is not a routing/navigation app. The app aims to bring you offline access (i.e. no internet connection required) to the following:\n• A detailed map of the country or region you purchase. The country map roughly corresponds to a 1:1 000 000 paper map in terms of its detail and will allow you to view the map at different zoom levels.  The map works similar to a web map with the difference being that all information is installed on your device.  It contains place names like cities, towns and villages together with a detailed road and track network.  It also shows you all protected areas such as national parks and game reserves together with relevant background data such as rivers, mountains and major attractions.\n• A detailed guide with the following categories: Places (cities, towns, etc), Attractions & Activities, Parks, Scenic, Camps, Lodging, Food & Drink, Fuel, Shopping, Services and More (miscellaneous points of interest). The guide information is linked to a location on the map and will display as a pin on the map for you to know where it is in reference to where you are.\n\nThe app will display a map of the country or region and allow you to switch on different categories of points of interest. You can also search for specific places by name. The map search is location sensitive, i.e. results will be relative to the centre of the map.\nYour position, determined from your iPhone or iPad’s location service, will display on the map so you can accurately orientate yourself on the map. As you drive, your location will update on the map so you always know where you are.  (iPhone or iPad with GPS required) \n\nThe search functionality is linked to the guide categories. For example, if you need to find a campsite, simply switch on the Camps category. Immediately all campsites around you will display on the map and you can click on them for more information. Otherwise, if you know the name of a campsite, enter it into the search block and relevant results will be filtered.\n\nWhat kind of information can you expect?\n\nApart from the categories already mentioned, points of interest will have associated information such as a description, contacts details, facilities and activities and some places will have photos. Have a look at the sample data in the free app to get an idea of what we offer.\n\nWhat about updates?\n\nGuide and Map content is updated once a quarter, and available for download if you have purchased the relevant guide.\n\nTalk to us\n\nWe sincerely would like to hear what you think of the app. If you place a comment, question or suggestion in the review section, we cannot reply to you. So please drop us a line so we can engage and learn what you would like to see in subsequent releases of our app. You can contact us at sales@tracks4africa.co.za or via our Facebook page: facebook.com/Tracks4Africa."

Choose to dive deeper with our brand new podcast featuring believers all over the world sharing their insights from the word of the day.\n\n• Word of the Day:  Each day we share a meaningful word to lay the groundwork for the day's devotion.\n\n• Definition: We've heard some of these words countless times and sometimes, as a result they began to lose their meaning. We go back to the root definition to remind ourselves that words do have meaning.\n\n• Scripture: We believe \".. the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and of spirit, of joints and of marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart.\" (Hebrews 4:12-13). God's Word is living, active and shapes us. Reflect on Scripture that follows the theme of the day.\n\n• Practice: Devotionals are nothing without application. Our hope is that together we can become people of these words through practice and intentional living.\n\n• Prayer: Lastly, we share a prayer to guide us as we seek to become more like Jesus Christ.\n\nFeatures include:\n\n• Widgets\n• Custom Reminders\n• Save your Favorites"

You can now search for a quote, highlight it, and then press a button to start playing at that location!\n\nRead Along - Read Along scrolls the page as needed to keep the text on the page as the audio is playing.\n\nHighlights and Notes - You can assign your highlights to more than one category. For example, a Quote that you would like to remember about the influence of music on young people could be tagged in many categories like Children, Influence, and Music. You do not have to choose the “best” category to store the highlight in. Later when you are researching any of those subjects, that quote is not missing.\n\nSubtitle - Subtitle is a Read Along mode that has been formatted to appear as large as possible on the screen with as few distractions as possible. One of its designed uses would be in a church for the projection of the text as you are listening to the sermon. Many Tablets support adapters that allow an external monitor or projector to mirror the display. This allows many people to view the screen at the same time. The Subtitle viewer also works well if you need larger text to read. This feature will really shine as we start adding foreign languages to the app in the future."

That’s why our app includes no ads straight out of the box.\n\nPrivacy-Focussed – Muslims are entitled to their privacy. That's why at Pillars we take your data very seriously. Not only do we promise not to collect it for malicious intent, we avoid collecting it in the first place!\n\nMuslim-Built – prayer apps should be built by Muslims. Why? Because we have your interests at heart and know the importance of Salah.

Option to disable notifications available.\n\nBeautiful Design – we want to beautify the act of Prayer, a key ibadah (act of worship) in Islam. Therefore, what better place to start than with an elegant prayer app.\n\nWidget Included – a beautifully designed widget for your home screen for quick access to prayer times\n\nPrayer Tracker – a great way to stay on top of your salah and the first step to developing your relationship with Allah. Perfect for new converts or those trying to improve their praying habits!\n\nMenstruation (pause) button - pause tracking and never miss out on a streak!\n\n\nComing Soon:\n\nLocal Mosque Prayer Times – get prayer times from your local mosque on the Pillars app, including notifications.\n\nFasting Tracker – easily mark days where you missed fasting and days that have been made up.\n\nMore Widgets – more beautifully designed widgets in all shapes & sizes.\n\nAt Pillars we're building features to help Muslims improve their individual condition in multiple aspects of their lives - from the spiritual to the non-spiritual.\n\nDownload the app and join us on this journey inshaAllah."

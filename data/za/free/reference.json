The music that plays when you read the verses, the scrolling like flipping a page, and everything about it just makes my time with God feel very intimate when I am reading daily verses and able to go through some of the devotionals. Really grateful to have had this app shared with me, especially during everything going on right now, it couldn’t have been better timing. We have also shared it with our Dad who loves the app as well. I have used apps in the past such as the Bible app that is very well known and found that some of the devotionals included someone’s biased opinion instead of focusing on what God is saying to us in the Bible. This app and the Jesus Calling App are the only apps for Devotionals and Daily verses that I consistently use because I love them so much and deeply appreciate that they stick to what the Bible says and not someone’s own interpretation of it. Whoever designed this app did an incredible job! Thank you so much!\"\n\nReceive God's word daily through beautiful Holy Bible stories, verses, and music. Receive personal, relevant verses for inspiration and sharing with loved ones.  Each day a new verse is sent to your device - it's like receiving a message from a dear friend who loves you and wants you to be happy.  Join the #Bible movement, share the Word, and fill social media with grace.\n\nYou may use this app for free, but if you would be delighted to support our mission of delivering thousands of moments of grace, love, and wisdom each day, there are patronage subscriptions available. \n\nTerms of service: http://www.mindblownapp.com/terms\nPrivacy policy: http://www.mindblownapp.com/privacy"

Over and above the GPS location, you can search by shape, type, colours, size, where seen, bird calls and more. There are 100's of attributes you can choose from, which makes identifying a bird accurate and easy. As a first ever bird app achievement, the resulting bird list is sorted by relevance with the most probable birds matching your search criteria at the top, which makes it extremely quick and accurate. The ability to remove birds from the results is a game-changer. It even has a section for hard to  identify birds (LBJ's, etc)\n\nIn addition to the SmartSearch function, BirdPro contains the most accurate Image Recognition for South African birds. You can upload images from your device or take a photo with the device's camera, which will then be used for the Image Recognition.

Sightings lists can be viewed and can even be synced to a website and shared between devices. \n\nBirdPro also offers a Similars functionality. It not only ranks the similars, it also gives preference to your location selection. When using a location filter, similars at that location will be ranked higher and similars outside of your selected location will be displayed last. Both these features are a first for any bird app!\n\nNo internet connectivity is required to operate the app after it is installed which makes it possible to use the app in the most remote locations.\n\nAll updates are regular and free. \nMajor functional additions, like Image Recognition, is charged for additionally."

In the late 1990’s, David’s material first appeared on the Blue Letter Bible, and was found to be a valuable resource.\n\nDavid’s Bible resources – both in text and through audio and video – are used by many thousands of people every day. Many pastors, Bible teachers, and everyday Christians find these materials helpful.\n\nNow you can take the Enduring Word Commentary with you on your mobile device."

Sometimes the best way to start is to keep it simple.\n\nPractice Devo is a completely free, ad-free, simple, easy, 365 daily devotional for both men and women, designed to capture our hearts and minds for a few moments of our busy day. Choose to dive deeper with our brand new podcast featuring believers all over the world sharing their insights from the word of the day.\n\n• Word of the Day:  Each day we share a meaningful word to lay the groundwork for the day's devotion.\n\n• Definition: We've heard some of these words countless times and sometimes, as a result they began to lose their meaning. We go back to the root definition to remind ourselves that words do have meaning.\n\n• Scripture: We believe \".. the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and of spirit, of joints and of marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart.\" (Hebrews 4:12-13). God's Word is living, active and shapes us. Reflect on Scripture that follows the theme of the day.\n\n• Practice: Devotionals are nothing without application. Our hope is that together we can become people of these words through practice and intentional living.\n\n• Prayer: Lastly, we share a prayer to guide us as we seek to become more like Jesus Christ.\n\nFeatures include:\n\n• Widgets\n• Custom Reminders\n• Save your Favorites"

      "label": "SKY TONIGHT is a brand-new astronomical app for exploring the sky. It helps stargazers answer the three most common questions:\n\n⁕ What is that bright dot in the sky?\n⁕ What astronomical events can I see tonight?\n⁕ How can I find the object I'm interested in?\n\nMade by the developers of Star Walk apps, Sky Tonight is a customizable stargazing tool, that is designed for users with different needs and wants. You can adjust the constellation's appearance, set a reminder for any space body configuration, explore the unique relative to observer trajectory, set up a magnitude limit to filter out space objects, and much more.\n\nSKY TONIGHT FEATURES:\n\n► Point your device at the sky to see the real-time positions of space objects on the interactive sky map.\n► Activate the Time Machine and determine the position of celestial bodies at different time periods.\n► Use the augmented reality mode and see the sky map overlaid on the image from your device's camera.\n► Get extended information about any sky object by tapping on its name.\n► Stay updated on the latest news from the world of astronomy with the What's new section.\n► Turn on the night mode to make your sky observation in the nighttime more comfortable.\n► Filter the objects that appear on the sky map according to their visual brightness.\n► Regulate the brightness of objects on the sky map.\n► Spot dozens of asterisms along with the official constellations. \n► Adjust the visible constellations and customize their representation on the screen.\n\nUNIQUE FEATURES:\n\n◆ INTERACTIVE TRAJECTORIES RELATIVE TO AN OBSERVER\nInstead of the classic trajectory that shows the object’s trajectory in the celestial sphere relative to the Earth’s center, the app presents the object’s trajectory in the sky relative to an observer. A long touch on the trajectories relative to the observer will move the sky object to the selected point. While holding the touch, move your finger along the trajectory to change the time.\n\n◆ FLEXIBLE SEARCH\nMake use of the flexible search — quickly find space objects, easily navigate across different objects and events’ types. Look for \"stars\", \"mars moons\", \"mars conjunctions\", \"solar eclipse\", and the app will show you all related objects, events, and articles!\nThere are also Trending and Recent categories in the search section. The first one presents the currently most popular objects, events, or news; the second category contains objects you recently selected. \n\n◆ FULLY CUSTOMIZABLE EVENT REMINDERS\nSet event reminders on any time and date not to miss a solar eclipse, a Full Moon, or a star-planet configuration you're interested in.\n\n◆ ASTRONOMY CALENDAR WITH A STARGAZING INDEX AND WEATHER FORECAST\nCheck out the calendar of celestial events that includes lunar phases, meteor showers, eclipses, oppositions, conjunctions, and other exciting events. Learn what astronomy events will occur this month or see what happened in the sky a year ago!\nVerify the Stargazing Index calculated from a Moon phase, light pollution, cloudiness, and time when an object is visible. The higher this index is, the better the observation conditions are.\n\nYou don’t need several apps for your stargazing planning anymore; Sky Tonight contains all the info you need.\n\nPremium Access:\n\n* The app includes paid Premium Access. Get Premium Access to use Sky Tonight with no limits! Without the subscription, you can’t see most of the interface items in various sections such as Visible Tonight, Calendar, and Search. Therefore, you’re limited in planning and improving your observations. Premium Access will allow you to unlock all the interface items in any view and make the most of all the app’s features. Advertisements will also be removed not to interrupt your stargazing experience.\n\nPrivacy policy: https://vitotechnology.com/privacy-policy\nTerms of use: https://vitotechnology.com/terms-of-use"

The map works similar to a web map with the difference being that all information is installed on your device.  It contains place names like cities, towns and villages together with a detailed road and track network.  It also shows you all protected areas such as national parks and game reserves together with relevant background data such as rivers, mountains and major attractions.\n• A detailed guide with the following categories: Places (cities, towns, etc), Attractions & Activities, Parks, Scenic, Camps, Lodging, Food & Drink, Fuel, Shopping, Services and More (miscellaneous points of interest). The guide information is linked to a location on the map and will display as a pin on the map for you to know where it is in reference to where you are.\n\nThe app will display a map of the country or region and allow you to switch on different categories of points of interest. You can also search for specific places by name. The map search is location sensitive, i.e. results will be relative to the centre of the map.\nYour position, determined from your iPhone or iPad’s location service, will display on the map so you can accurately orientate yourself on the map. As you drive, your location will update on the map so you always know where you are.  (iPhone or iPad with GPS required) \n\nThe search functionality is linked to the guide categories. For example, if you need to find a campsite, simply switch on the Camps category. Immediately all campsites around you will display on the map and you can click on them for more information. Otherwise, if you know the name of a campsite, enter it into the search block and relevant results will be filtered.\n\nWhat kind of information can you expect?\n\nApart from the categories already mentioned, points of interest will have associated information such as a description, contacts details, facilities and activities and some places will have photos. Have a look at the sample data in the free app to get an idea of what we offer.\n\nWhat about updates?\n\nGuide and Map content is updated once a quarter, and available for download if you have purchased the relevant guide.\n\nTalk to us\n\nWe sincerely would like to hear what you think of the app. If you place a comment, question or suggestion in the review section, we cannot reply to you. So please drop us a line so we can engage and learn what you would like to see in subsequent releases of our app. You can contact us at sales@tracks4africa.co.za or via our Facebook page: facebook.com/Tracks4Africa."

      "label": "** The #1 Catholic App & #1 Prayer App **\n\nWHAT IS HALLOW\nHallow is a Catholic prayer app that offers audio-guided meditation sessions to help us grow in our faith & spiritual lives and find peace in God. Explore over 6,000 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Bible readings, music, and more.\n\nIn today’s world, we’re stressed, anxious, distracted, & can’t sleep. At the same time, we’re searching for deeper meaning, purpose, & relationships. We believe these two challenges can be addressed with the same solution: peace in Jesus. In the end, after all, a halo in heaven is the goal :)\n\nWHAT YOU GET\n* Daily prayers: Pray daily across methods including 3 of our most popular - Lectio Divina (on the Daily Readings), the Rosary, & the Divine Mercy Chaplet\n* Christian Meditation: This can seem similar to mindfulness meditation in learning to be comfortable in silence, but the difference is the goal is never to remain in ourselves, but always to lift our hearts & minds to God, to talk with Him, listen to Him, & recognize His presence with us\n* Sleep Bible Stories: Try Night Prayer from Liturgy of the Hours / Daily Office, and Catholic Bible stories read by folks like Jonathan Roumie from the Chosen or Fr. Mike Schmitz from the New American Bible\n* Rosary: Meditate with Mary through the mysteries of the Catholic Rosary and other devotionals\n* Ignatian Examen: Reflect on your day & discover an awareness of God, Jesus Christ, & the Holy Spirit\n* Lectio Divina: Enter into a conversation with God through Bible passages / Scripture\n* Taizé & Gregorian Chant: Meditative chant & music\n* Community: Match your prayers to the season with the #pray40 Lent Challenge, starting Ash Wednesday, or our #pray25 Advent Challenge for Christmas\n* Homilies & Guests: From Father Mike Schmitz, and on topics on being a Catholic Dad, St. Augustine & more!\n* Praylists: Sessions on joy, humility, discernment, or stress / anxiety / calm\n* Challenges: Re-discover the Our Father, Stations of the Cross, Psalms, and Saints - or start with the Intro 9 Day Novena\n* Litanies & Novenas: Try out the Litany of Humility, the 54 Day Novena, and more!\n* Minute Meditations: Jesus, I Trust in You, Angelus, Rosary Decade, St. Michael the Archangel prayer and more!\n\nAdditional features to help customize your prayer experience:\n* Journal after every prayer\n* Choice of man or woman guide\n* Options for 3 different lengths for every prayer (typically 5, 10, or 15 minutes)\n* Ability to set prayer reminders\n* Option to include calming background music like Gregorian Chant\n* Ability to download sessions for offline listening\n* Ability to join a Hallow Family to share prayer intentions and prayer reflections with one another\n\nAs Hallow is a Catholic App (#1 among Catholic Apps), the content is developed by experienced Catholic theology and spirituality guides and reviewed by senior leaders within the Church (e.g., PhD’s, professors, Bishops, authors) and based on content from the approved Catholic Bible. We were also featured on EWTN. While it can be a beautiful app for Catholic men and women, it is meant as a resource for people of all faiths & religions.\n\nSUBSCRIPTION PRICING AND TERMS\nUsers can access our daily prayers (including the rosary) and the 9-day Intro Prayer Challenge for free.\nTo access the full suite of Hallow, Hallow offers two auto-renewing subscription options:\n$8.99 per month\n$59.99 per year\n\nThese prices are for United States customers.\n\nYour Hallow subscription will renew automatically unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. You can go to your Apple account settings to manage your subscription and turn off auto-renew. Your account will be charged when the purchase is confirmed. Hallow also integrates with the Apple Health app to sync mindfulness minutes.\nTerms and conditions: https://hallow.com/terms-of-service\nPrivacy policy: https://hallow.com/privacy-policy"

      "label": "Learn Salah/Namaz from scratch, memorize surahs of the Quran, learn Dua, and check prayer times. Suitable for beginners.\n\nWhat is Namaz?\nNamaz is the daily muslim prayer, also known as Salat or Salah. It is one of the five pillars of Islam and the best way of worshipping Allah the Almighty.\n\nDescription:\nThis app is an audio player for you to listen to the correct pronunciation of the prayers in Arabic. It will help you to learn the dua-invocations and parts of the Quran that are read inside the prayer. You will also have the texts in English transliteration and some illustrations to help you navigate through the process. All content is in accordance with the rules of the Hanafi school of law.\n\nImportant to understand, that this is a companion app, and it is not sufficient to fully learn the prayer on its own. We also strongly recommend that you learn to read Arabic, as English letters and phonemes are not sufficient to convey all sounds found in Arabic. Learning to read Arabic will allow you to perform your prayers in the best way and will give you access to the Holy Quran. The easiest and most effective way to learn both prayer and reading Arabic is to find a good teacher.\n\nAttribution:\n- Prayer images were kindly provided by the Muslim web portal Azan.kz\n- Prayer times are fetched from the open API of Aladhan.com\n- The Charity elements icon pack used in the \"Support us\" module was created by Eucalyp - Flaticon (https://www.flaticon.com/packs/charity-elements-4)\n- The Calendar icon  used in the \"Recurring Donation\" screen was created by Freepik - Flaticon (https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/year)\n\nThe Terms of Use: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/"

Everything on Telegram, including chats, groups, media, etc. is encrypted using a combination of 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie–Hellman secure key exchange. \n\n100% FREE & OPEN: Telegram has a fully documented and free API for developers, open source apps and verifiable builds to prove the app you download is built from the exact same source code that is published. \n\nPOWERFUL: You can create group chats with up to 200,000 members, share large videos, documents of any type (.DOCX, .MP3, .ZIP, etc.) up to 2 GB each, and even set up bots for specific tasks. Telegram is the perfect tool for hosting online communities and coordinating teamwork.\n\nRELIABLE: Built to deliver your messages using as little data as possible, Telegram is the most reliable messaging system ever made. It works even on the weakest mobile connections. \n\nFUN: Telegram has powerful photo and video editing tools, animated stickers and emoji, fully customizable themes to change the appearance of your app, and an open sticker/GIF platform to cater to all your expressive needs.\n\nSIMPLE: While providing an unprecedented array of features, we take great care to keep the interface clean. Telegram is so simple you already know how to use it.\n\nPRIVATE: We take your privacy seriously and will never give any third parties access to your data. You can delete any message you ever sent or received for both sides, at any time and without a trace. Telegram will never use your data to show you ads.\n\nFor those interested in maximum privacy, Telegram offers Secret Chats. Secret Chat messages can be programmed to self-destruct automatically from both participating devices. This way you can send all types of disappearing content — messages, photos, videos, and even files. Secret Chats use End-to-End Encryption to ensure that a message can only be read by its intended recipient.\n\nWe keep expanding the boundaries of what you can do with a messaging app. Don’t wait years for older messengers to catch up with Telegram — join the revolution today.\n\nApple Terms of Use: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/"

On Livestatus, you can send all types of messages, including texts, photos, emoji status and your drawings straight to your friends’ lock and Home Screen. When your friends see your updates on screens, they can open the widget and send their messages back to your lock& phone screens. Livestatus offers an intimate and innovative way for friends to chat and stay connected with each other.\n\n- Send messages to friends’ lock & Home Screens\nLivestatus is the first app that allows you to ‘pin’ your messages on your friends’ lock & Home Screen via widget. Everything you send in chat, including  texts, photos, emoji status and your doodles, will automatically go to your friends’ lock & Home Screen. Pin your messages so your friends' will never miss them.\n\n- Reply friends’ moments in Picture-in-Picture format!\nResponding to your friends’ moments has never been easier! when you receive a photo from your friends on Home Screen, you can tap the widget and snap a photo to send back to them. You and your friends’ photo will be in the same frame in the picture-in-picture (PIP) format. \n\n- Hundreds of status to spark conversations\nOn Livestatus, you can add an emoji status on your photo. The status shows on friends' Lock Screen while the photo goes to Home Screen. We have a big collection of 100+ emoji status . It’s ok if you don’t know which status to choose, lively can random a status and it will be fun to see how your friends react :)\n\n- Vanish mode available!\nLivestatus added the vanish mode for sharing photos! when you send a photo to your friends, they only have one chance to view it. Once it's viewed, the photo will vanish both from your widget and chat. In this new mode, you can safely send private or timely photos to your friends without worrying about leaving evidence. Even screenshots won't work in vanish mode! \n\nLivestatus is the best way for you and your friends to stay connected, and it will for sure transform the  way you share your life moments. Thank you for having Livestatus on your phone. Should you have any questions or suggestions, please email us at  livestatus.widget@gmail.com"

Enough memes to knock out a moderately-sized mammal. Add to it or simply scroll through and soak it up. \n\nOh, and influencers? Don’t even go here. Every video you find, every quote you reblog, every tag you curate, every waterfall GIF you secretly gaze at in wonder—that’s all you. You’re the explorer. We’re just a map you all keep on making. Welcome home. Welcome to weird. Make it yours. \n\nNow picture all of the above, but on the go. That’s what this is. \n\n-\n\nChances are if you’ve seen it elsewhere, it probably started here. That text post explaining the exquisite specifics of something you never realized you needed to know. That digital painting you can’t stop thinking about. Tumblr is the home of all things weird and wonderful, funny and fascinating—old-school internet vibes. We’re built a little different, just like everyone else who goes here.\n\nYour dashboard will become the place to see what you want to see: a chronological tapestry of all the wonderful, nonsensical, fantastical things you like. Whether you post, lurk in likes, reblog and add your own take, this is your universe to discover, express, and enjoy. Whatever your community, you’ll find a ready-made home here.\n\nWhen you have something to say—a hot take on the finer points of a Virgo moon, an image of your turtle Harold that you simply *have* to share with the world, F1 fanfic that your mutuals need to see—you have so many options. Shoot your shot with a photo, a video, or a text post. You can make an audio post of your ramblings or share your current favorite song via Spotify. We even have a pre-set chat post for all your incorrect quotes. Don’t say we don’t spoil you!\n\nThe reblog starts conversations in which anyone can join. Reblogging creates jokes and continues them—sometimes across the world and over the years. Whatever you choose to send into our effervescent digital ether, know that it can, and will, go anywhere. (Unless, of course, you use our post-level reblog controls. Private blog? Private post only for a couple of your friends to engage with? All possible here). No matter who you are, where you are, or what you are (looking at you here, Pikaman), this is your space—with as much freedom or privacy as you need. \n\nTumblr is the home of fandom. Maybe you have a favorite blorbo from your show? There’s fanart you’ll want to stare at, reblog, stare at again—or create yourself. You can read your favorite ficcers from ao3, *and* see their OC art on Tumblr, *and* discuss the finer points of lore with them. Pokémon? Got it. Marvel? Here. Kpop? Check. Supernatural? Of course. Minecraft? Ready and waiting. Star Wars? Yes! Doctor Who? You get the idea: it’s all here. Wait. Frogs. Did we mention the frogs? \n\nIt’s a whole world out here. If the prospect of reblogging, shipping, curating, and fanart feels a little daunting, or you simply require a refresher on how all this works, head over to tips.tumblr.com, where Cat Frazier of animatedtext.tumblr.com will take you through the finer points of Tumblr etiquette—the effervescent, the eeby, the deeby.\n\nSo. Sign up, follow some tags, and find your place on the dashboard. Then reblog, like, and post to your heart’s content. Or simply drift through the dream you’ve created for yourself—a chronological dashboard curated by you. For you. You hold the keys to this kingdom.\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/tumblr/\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/tumblr/\n\nTerms of Service: https://www.tumblr.com/policy/terms-of-service"

To offer the widest range of features and up-to-date technology the app has been updated more than 60 times in the past 3 years and we will continue to do so.\n\nYou only need to scan a QR code and then you can:\n\n- access all of your WhatsApp chats (and group chats)\n- enjoy VOICE MESSAGES (SEND + RECEIVE)\n- reply to chats via KEYBOARD, QUICK REPLIES, DICTATION and SCRIBBLE\n- use a VARIETY of different KEYBOARD LAYOUTS*\n- watch VIDEOS\n- see STATUS UPDATES (TEXT, PICTURE, VIDEO)\n- view STICKERS and HD PICTURES (and ZOOM into them in native resolution)\n- CUSTOMIZE your quick replies\n- start a new chat right from the Watch\n- set each chat's font size\n- …\n\n... all with full respect to your privacy, WatchChat does not collect any personal data.\n\n*The currently supported keyboard layouts are:\n\n- FlickType (English)\n- ABC (English, Deutsch, Español, Português, אבגדה, Ελληνικά, Suomi, русский)\n- QWERTY (English, Español, Italiano)\n- QWERTZ (Deutsch)\n- AZERTY (Français)\n- אבגדה)עברית)\n\n\n\nSetting up the app for the first time only takes 4 simple steps:\n\n- open the app on your Apple Watch\n- open WhatsApp\n- in WhatsApp, go to (Settings) > (Linked Devices / WhatsApp Web) > (Link a device)\n- scan the QR code that will appear on your Apple Watch after 10-30 seconds\n- if a popup comes up, just try again, it will work out eventually :)\n\n\nAs this is a 3rd-party-app, I would really appreciate if you had suggestions for further development so I can take your ideas into consideration. If you encounter issues while using the app, don't hesitate to contact me, I am more than happy to help.\n\n\nPlease keep in mind that, as the app isn’t officially affiliated with WhatsApp, available features and functionality are subject to change. To keep up with everything, the app has been updated more than 70 times since its release in 2017 - I am always looking for ways to offer new features or improve the existing ones.\n\n\nYou can use the app for free forever, but if you want to support the app's further development, the \"Support WatchChat Development\" subscription CAN be purchased for free users to access the \"Contacts\" and \"Status\" sections and will grant access to future additions. After the free trial period, if offered, the subscription automatically renews with the price and duration given in the purchase button unless it is canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. Payment will be charged to your Apple ID account at the confirmation of purchase. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. YOU CAN MANAGE AND CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTIONS BY GOING TO YOUR ACCOUNT SETTINGS ON THE APP STORE AFTER PURCHASE. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\n\nAs of January, IF you want to sign up for the subscription, the free trial period is 3 days, it is billed annually and the price is about the equivalent of 3 USD.\n\n\nTerms of use: https://watchchat.info/terms.html"

With personality insight, you are empowered to understand how it all works for yourself, make the right decisions, and set yourself up for success.\n\nWe were using all the dating apps. It was always the same result–going on dates with people we had no chemistry with. We were exhausted from all the wasted time and effort. We made Boo because we knew there was a better way.\n\nOur mission is to create a future in which personality enables our greatest potential, starting with our relationships.\n\nWe hope you like it,\nThe souls at Boo\n\nhttps://boo.world/terms-and-conditions"

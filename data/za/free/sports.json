Insights like you have never seen before. View all your statistics from your fishing patterns. Designed to help you improve your fishing skills using your logbook fishing pattern entries. Have insights into your fishing performance and filter to the \"T\". Filter by lake, season, date, sky conditions, water temperature, water visibility and so much more. The Fishit App helps determine your next best fishing pattern from your logbook data.\n\nWhat is a fishing pattern? It's a set of weather and water conditions that cause bass to behave in a certain way and relate to a certain cover and depth, therefor if an angler has figured out a pattern of catching fish in those certain conditions he will have the ability to repeat this over time and catch more fish when that pattern and conditions present itself again. In short, it's the repetitive behaviour of the fish during a specific period, affected by a set of circumstances. Recording your pattern each time you fish is vital data you are collecting on the Fishit App logbook. The Fishit App knows exactly what data to import and what data to collect from the angler in order to determine and show you the angler your most successful technique, cover, depth, and much more statistics in a set of factors and how to improve your performance by being able to analyze your statistics.\n\nYou never have to depend on your memory again, leave it to the Fishit App to keep you a logbook of patterns and techniques. You'll never have to worry about keeping a pen and paper logbook again. It takes just a minute and your fishing pattern is recorded and safely stored in your logbook. View your logbook of data from any season, lake, water temperature, sky conditions, and more. You can filter by multiple factors, down to the exact conditions. Fishit patterns entries go down into the very detail of your technique, the cover, structure, and many more. Customise and add your own techniques, structure, and cover so you don't miss any detail. Save photos of your special bait to review at a later stage. Never forget what bait colour, type of hook, or size of weight you used. Make special notes on bait fish, bird activity, or just about anything you feel is valuable to your pattern for the day. Backtrack years and record your patterns from anywhere at any time.\n\nThis App is user-friendly and makes it very simple, quick, and easy to use. Weather and many factors are imported for you based on your chosen location. The App and the Fishit team are dedicated to continuously developing and improving the app according to the fisherman's requirements. The Fishit evolution has started. Enjoy the free version and build up your data. Fishit logbook will become your most valuable tool on the water with unlimited features."

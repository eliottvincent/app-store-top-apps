      "label": "Silicon Valley’s new success story, inDrive is a free ride-hailing app available in more than 700 cities in 47 countries. We are growing fast by putting the power back in the hands of people\n\ninDrive first emerged as a taxi alternative — a mobility app where affordable rides for passengers would still mean well-paid rides for drivers. \n \nBut now, there’s so much more to it. You can use inDrive to travel to other cities, send and receive packages, book a truck for your personal or business needs, and even hire a local pro to help you with whatever you need. You can also sign up as a driver, courier, or tasker.\n\nThe main idea is the same for all services: A fair price is the one you agree on — not hope for. inDrive exists to prove that people can always come to an agreement. \n\nWhat We Offer\nCITY RIDES\nAffordable everyday rides with no surge pricing. You get to set the fare and choose your ride based on the driver’s price offer, rating, number of completed rides, car model, and pickup time.\n\nINTERCITY RIDES\nA safe and convenient way to travel between cities. Specify your destination, pickup date, time and location, offer your fare and request a ride. \n\nCOURIER SERVICES\nThis door-to-door on-demand delivery service is a fast and safe way to send and receive packages of up to 20 kilos. Offer your fare ​​and track your delivery in real-time.\n\nFREIGHT SERVICES\nBook a truck for your delivery and moving needs. Set the time and the fare and specify any extra details in the comments. Wait for the offers to roll in and choose the one that works best for you.\n\nPROFESSIONAL SERVICES\nFrom home improvement to tutoring and beauty care services. Describe your task, name your price and get skilled help from local pros you can trust.\n\nWhy choose inDrive\nQUICK AND EASY\nIt's simple and fast to request an affordable ride — just enter points \"A\" and \"B\" in the app, name the fare you are willing to pay, and choose your driver.\n\nOFFER YOUR FARE\ninDrive provides you with a tailored, surge-free ride-hailing experience. Here you, and not the algorithm, decide on the fare and choose the driver. We do not set the pricing according to time and mileage like other services. You agree on a win-win price with the driver before the ride starts.\n\nCHOOSE YOUR DRIVER\ninDrive lets you choose your driver from a list of the drivers who accepted your ride request. Pick them based on the best deal, arrival time, driver's rating, number of completed trips, and even a car model.\n\nSTAY SAFE\nSee the driver's name, car model, license plate number, and the number of previously completed trips before accepting the ride. During your trip, you can share the driver's information and the real-time location of the car with your family or friends using the \"Share Your Ride\" button. Your real-time geolocation can be shared via messengers, social networks, e-mail, or SMS Text. All of that is there to make your experience safe & trusted. We're continuously adding new safety features to the app to make sure both riders and drivers can enjoy 100% safe rides.\n\nADD TRAVEL OPTIONS\nDo you have specific requirements? Specify travel add-ons — SUV, extra stops on the way, a child seat, or accommodating special needs. You can write your specific needs or any other details in the comments field like \"traveling with my pet,\" “I have luggage,\" etc.\n\nSIGN UP AS A DRIVER & MAKE EXTRA MONEY\nIf you have a car, inDrive provides an excellent opportunity to make extra money. Set your schedule and enjoy complete transparency with inDrive. See your passenger's drop-off location and fare before accepting the ride request. If the passenger’s price doesn’t seem enough, you can always offer your fare or skip the rides you don’t like with no penalties.\nBest of all, low-to-no service rates mean you make more money driving with inDrive!\n\nWe can't wait for you to experience it. Install the app and let’s ride!"

Flightradar24 has a rapidly growing network of 20,000 ground stations to receive this data that then shows up as aircraft moving on a map in the app. In an expanding number of regions, with the help of multilateration, we’re able to calculate the positions of aircraft that don’t have ADS-B transponders. Coverage is subject to change at any time.\n\nCONNECT WITH FLIGHTRADAR24\nWe love getting feedback on FR24. Since we’re unable to respond directly to reviews, contact us directly and we’ll be happy to assist if you’re having any issues.\n• email (support@fr24.com)\n• twitter (@flightradar24)\n• Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/Flightradar24)\n\nDISCLAIMER\nThe use of this app is strictly limited to entertainment purposes.

      "label": "Yango is an easy-to-use app for getting around the city\n\nTaxify your life with the Yango taxi app. It puts the whole city in your hands and lets you ride wherever you want to go via taxi. Do it all by making a taxi order via the Yango taxi app.\n\nChoose the right service class for you\n\nReach your destination at the right level of comfort and price for you. Choose from several service classes. Start is perfect for short rides. Economy is awesome for when you need a car fast. Comfort lets you sit back and enjoy the ride. And The Fastest offers rides when the service class doesn’t matter… you need the closest available taxi!\n\nRide safely\n\nSafety is our top priority. You’ll see who’s coming to pick you up and in which car right in the app. You’ll see the driver’s name and rating and be able to share your ride with whomever you like so they know where you are.\n\nSmart destinations\n\nYango will suggest destinations for your taxi ride based on your ride history, like first offering ‘home’ as a destination because it’s your most common taxi order on weekday evenings. Ride taxis the smart way!\n\nMultiple destinations, one route\n\nThe Yango taxi app makes everyday life easier. Like picking the kids up from school, dropping a friend off at a market, and doing some quick shopping on the way. Just add a new taxi order stop in the app, and Yango will recalculate a new route for the driver. That makes it even easier to ride a taxi.\n\nOrder for someone else\n\nYango lets you order friends and loved ones a ride by taxi. Get your mother to a doctor’s appointment with a taxi order. Send a taxi online to pick up your special someone. Or get each of your friends a ride home after a night out. You can order up to 3 cars at once.\n\nTell your friends about the Yango taxi app and get discounts\n\nYou can get discounts for your rides by inviting friends to use the Yango app. Share your personal promo code with them and receive bonuses when they take their first ride. Ride taxi, tell friends, save. It’s as easy as that.\n\nAn international service\n\nYango is a ride-hailing service that operates mobility and delivery aggregators in 19 countries, including Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire, Cameroon, Senegal and Zambia.\n\nIsrael Only\n3 free Wind scooter ride unlocks and a 20 NIS discount\nA little birdie told us that Wind scooters are now available in Yango. These scooters are bright yellow (not lime green), so you can't miss them! Easily order a scooter, find locations on the map (they look like a dot), and build routes with the same high-quality scooters you know and love, all in one convenient, top-tier app. We offer free unlocks and 20 NIS discounts on the first 3 rides to everyone who loves the feel of the wind in their hair. Just log into Yango, select scooters, and enjoy your three free unlocks!\n\nMeet Delivery in Israel - it's like a taxi service, but for your packages\n\nWe've also built in a fast delivery service into Yango - use Delivery to quickly send personal packages or even business orders by courier all around the Gush Dan district. Delivery is suitable for any item that can be transported by scooter or car.\n\nEnjoy your ride!\n\nIf you would like to share your feedback on the Yango taxi app or a specific taxi company, please use the feedback form located at yango.com/en_gh/support/\n\nYango is an informational service and not a transportation or taxi services provider. Transportation services are provided by third parties. \nUp to 50% (max 6 GHC/5 GHC) discount is valid on the first three rides for new users in Accra/Kumasi until 31.12.2022.\nThe 30% (max 10 EUR) discount is valid on the first three rides for new users in Helsinki until 31.12.2022.

Push notifications\n-You can set to get alerts of new sightings for all the parks you are interested in.\n\n3. Light on data\n-We have worked on making the app light on data, especially when you are in the park and using your data, and not using wifi.\n\nLatest Sightings is an app where visitors to the app's supported nature safari parks (view list of parks at end of description) can share their wildlife sightings, in realtime, with other visitors in the game reserve and also to users world wide.\n\nThe app is a service to visitors on safari. This utility app notifies you of sightings in your area, so that you can go and check them out for yourself in real life. \nYou never have to drive around the whole day seeing nothing, you can now see the magnificent big 5, such as the lion and leopard, everyday on your safari.\n\nThis is also the perfect app for wildlife lovers.

For example, a flight from New York to San Francisco might be $300, but a similar flight from New York to Seattle with a layover in San Francisco might be $200. If you’re going to San Francisco we’ll show you both flights, and if you choose the cheaper one, you get off the plane at the layover (San Francisco) rather than going to the final destination (Seattle).\n\nThis is perfectly legal and the savings can be significant, but if you’ve never traveled like this before, you should read our HIDDEN-CITY FAQ at http://skiplagged.com/faq\n\nWe’ll always show you all the options, so YOU can pick the deal you want!"

      "label": "9292 travels with 2 million travellers every month\nThanks to the travel planner of 9292, you can plan all your trips with the train, bus, metro, tram, and ferry. Need to travel by bicycle, electric bicycle / scooter or a rental bike? We can include that in your travel advice. Enter your trip from A to B and we will immediately show you up-to-date travel information for all public transport in the Netherlands. And the app is prepared for showing Flex-OV such as the watertaxi in Rotterdam. In case of any changes, we will show you an alternative travel advice automatically. The up-to-date public transport planner provides live public transport info for NS, Arriva, Connexxion, Breng, Hermes, Keolis, RRReis, Qbuzz, EBS, U-OV, RET, HTM, GVB and Waterbus.\n\nE-ticket for the entire journey\nYou can buy e-tickets straight from the travel advice in the 9292 app. The affiliated public transport services for bus, tram, metro and ferry are Breng, Connexxion, EBS, Hermes, HTM, Keolis, RET, U-OV and Waterbus. For all national trains, these are NS, Blauwnet, Qbuzz, Connexxion, Arriva and Keolis.\n\nMusic on the go\nPlan your journey in the 9292 app. At the bottom of the travel advice of your choice you will see the button \"Playlist for this trip\". This will take you to the Playlist Generator. On this page we create a playlist based on the travel time of your chosen travel advice. Log in to your Spotify account and we place the created playlist in the library of your Spotify account, so that you can easily find it and enjoy your music during your trip.\n\nOccupancy expectation\nDuring these times, it is important to take into account how crowded the train, bus, tram or metro service is for your travel plans. The 9292 app displays the expected occupancy per mode of transport for each travel advice, as communicated to us by the transport services.\n\nBicycle pre- and post-journey\nUnder ‘Options’, you can indicate if you want to walk, cycle or ride a scooter at the start or end of  your trip. This will give you the most complete advice with all relevant information for travelling from A to B. You can also opt for an electric bicycle or rental bicycle. To make it even easier, we also show you bicycle rental locations if you select bicycle. Very useful for covering the last bit to your final destination!\n\nFrom/to\nThe app has multiple options for selecting your location of departure or arrival: your ‘current location’ (via GPS), a known location (shopping mall, station or attraction), an address or bus stop, your contacts, and even your frequently or recently used locations.\n\nUnique starting screen\nEnter your favourite locations and routes on the starting screen by using the plus-sign. This turns the 9292-app into your own personal app for quickly planning your trip from A to B, without needing an account. You can also add a bus stop or station you frequently use to your starting screen this way. Now you will always have access to the up-to-date departure times of that stop.\n\nSave travel advice\nWant to save a specific travel advice? You can! Simply use the plus-sign in the top right corner of the travel advice. You can find your saved travel advice by using the menu in the app.\n\nRoute on the map\nThe travel advice shows you a map with the route of that advice. Press on this and you will see the travel advice step by step on a detailed map. Now you can swipe through your entire trip!"

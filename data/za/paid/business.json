SA Contacts sends all of your contacts to you from your iPhone in a convenient zip file by email, USB, or through a webpage seen only on your local wifi network! Contact photos are sent, too!\n3.

SA Contacts' zip file contains ALL of your contacts in a convenient, easy format.\n4. SA Contacts protects you from iTunes sync accidents which can delete your contacts if, for example, you no longer have access to an Exchange server.\n5. Restoring or changing contacts from the spreadsheet is as simple as uploading the file to your phone via USB, email or web. It couldn't be easier.\n6. You can print a hardcopy of your iPhone contacts. \n7. You can now export iPhone contacts to an Excel file which can then be imported to Outlook Contacts directly. \n8. You can also import contacts from an Excel file that has been exported from Outlook to your iPhone.\n9. You can now export/import iPhone contacts to/from a Gmail CSV-format file(UTF-8 encoded or Unicode encoded).\n10. You can upload export files over to Dropbox/GoogleDrive or download import files from Dropbox/GoogleDrive.\n11. You can password protect your export file.\n12. All Contact fields except Ringtones can be exported/imported.\n13. You can organise your contacts into groups easily on a spreadsheet and also assign a contact to multiple groups.\n14. You can remove all iPhone contacts or groups before importing your organized contacts. \n15. SA Contacts can support 30,000+ contact entries.\n16. All column headers and labels in the Excel file are localized.\n17. Export/Import contacts to/from a VCF file.\n18. Backup contacts before import.\n19. Manage groups easily. You can now create, edit, delete groups and add contacts to groups.\n20. Export an Excel file with all photos included - this makes the contacts in your spreadsheet look better.\n21.

The stunning 3D robot can chat with you, answer detailed questions and can guide and help you. \n\nThe knowledge base behind the app contains 'Wolfram Alpha', which gives you an enormous amount of information in your pocket. \nWith Voice Answer, you have full and unlimited access to this knowledge. \n\nExamples of topics and specific questions and commands: \n\nText: 'Send text to George I will be late' \n\nEmail: 'Email John Let's get together this week.' \n\nCall: 'Call mom' \n\nTranslation: 'Translate I would like to go now into Spanish' \n\nPlay songs on your device: 'Play music by Adele' \n\nReminder: 'Set reminder to 5 pm' \n\nSocial media: 'Post to Facebook This is great', 'Tweet I am going home now' \n\nSearch: 'Google this','Wiki that' \n\nLocation: 'Where am I?' \n\nPlaces: 'Where is the nearest bank?' \n\nMathematics: 'Integrate sin x dx from x=0 to pi' \n\nUnits & Measures 'U.K. men's size 11 shoe in Japanese size' \n\nMoney & Finance 'What is the Apple stock price' \n\nDates & Times 'What is the current time in Tokyo?' \n\nCurrent Weather 'What will be the high temperature today?' \n\nHealth & Medicine 'What is the life expectancy of a U.S. female age 30?' \n\nPlaces & Geography 'Where is ZIP 60637?' \n\nSocioeconomic Data 'Compare the age pyramid of New York and Miami' \n\nPeople & History 'When did Gandhi die?' \n\nFood & Nutrition '2 slices of swiss cheese' \n\nPhysics: 'What is the speed of light?' \n\nMaterials: 'Show me Topaz' \n\nEducation: 'How many kids are repeating primary school in California?' \n\nCulture & Media: 'US constitution' \n\nOrganizations: 'New York University' \n\nAstronomy:'Star chart' \n\nTransportation: 'Compare total length of all roads in USA and China' \n\nWords & Linguistics: 'Show me words that rhyme with bear' \n\nEarth Sciences: 'When was the Jurassic Period?' \n\nLife Sciences:'Compare puma, lion, red fox' \n\nSports & Games:'San Francisco Giants' \n\nWeb & Computer Systems: 'What is the cheapest tablet?' \n\nColors: 'What do you get when you mix red and blue' \n\nThe answers are spoken out, and relevant images are given. \n\nYou can also just have a general chat with Eve. Test her witty personality or just ask her to tell a joke or two. \n\nCommon Questions and concerns: \n\nQ: Why do I get strange answers to my question? \nA: Voice Answer will first check it's knowledge servers, including Wikipedia and Wolfram Alpha's award winning service, for an answer. If these don't respond, either because the answer is unavailable or the servers are down, the chatbot will answer the question. These answers are generally more funny than useful. You can avoid strange answers by disabling the chatbot, and try your question later. We are further enhancing our current data sources with additional databases as these become available, as we want to offer our customers the very best. \n\nQ: What do I do when voice answer doesn't understand my voice? \nA: Voice Answer compares your voice against a database of spoken english words and sentences. It works better for some people than for others. In general it works better than the voice recognition used by many other apps, but it depends on your accent. Try to speak slow and use regular sentences. If this doesn't work, you can use the keyboard. As and when better voice recognition algorithms are developed and become available, we can and will plug these in. \n\nQ: The app crashes. What can I do? \nA: On some devices such as the iPad1 or 3GS, it may sometimes be required to do a hard reset to get it to work. If this fails, removing the app and installing it again will generally get it going. We are working on improving the stability on those devices. \n\nPlease contact us at support@sparklingapps.com for any questions or comments. If you have any problems with any of the functions of the app, we can assist you with it. We are proud of our product and want our customers to get the most out of it."

      "label": "BenguFarm-MOBILE for iOS is a mobile application installed independently of BenguFarm on a iPhone or iPad. BenguFarm-MOBILE is to function side-by-side with BEEF/SHEEP & GOATS module and is used to lookup animal data in the field as well as to capture new animal data.  BenguFarm-MOBILE can be used for more than one herd (e.g. stud and commercial), whether the herds are on the same or different databases.\n\nCapture Data on your Smartphone or Tablet\n\nBenguFarm-MOBILE's primary function is to record data at the crush, the scale, the kraal or in the field on a iPhone or iPad. Secondly, to look up animalsí information when and where the need arises. Data exchange between BenguFarm-MOBILE and BenguFarm on a PC/laptop is done via a synchronisation function.\n\nAnimal Data and Photos in your Pocket\n\nData on a user's BenguFarm can be sent from his on his PC/laptop to BenguFarm-MOBILE on his smartphone or tablet. This data can then be viewed and, if needed, edited in the app on the smartphone or tablet. Data such as general animal information, reproduction data, weights, performance test data, traits, breeding values, performance of progeny, pedigree and health data can be viewed.\n\nBenguFarm-MOBILE can be used to capture all important data and animal photos on the spot while working with animals. Data that can be captured include new animals (registration), matings, pregnancy tests, calvings/lambings, weights, general notes, vaccinations, camp/group movements, wool data (sheep), illnesses, treatments, inspections, sightings, measurements, procedures, sales and deaths and camp activities (e.g. feed or lick put out). Please note that recording of data on BenguFarm-MOBILE does not need Internet access ñ recording is done off-line.\n\nUser customisable recording screens (Tasks)\n\nAn important feature of BenguFarm-MOBILE is its user-friendliness. Each data capturing screen is rendered according to a task definition. These task definitions can be changed by a user to his/her specific needs. Fields can be added or removed and even the order of the fields can be changed. In addition, fields can be marked as common fields. When a new session for a task (e.g. pregnancy tests) is started, such common fields only need to be completed once and will be recorded automatically for all animals during the session. Fields can also be temporarily disabled for a specific session.\n\nIn addition to the default list of tasks, a user can also set up their own tasks.\n\nIntegration with TruTest EID Readers\n\nBenguFarm-MOBILE integrates with the TruTest SRS2 & XRS2 and Agrident AWR250, AWR300 & APR600 EID readers in both the animal data view as well as data capturing screens.\n\nSessions, Entering Multiple Data and Camp Comparisons\n\nA user may select to enable session recording when capturing data. When a session is enabled, all the animals for which data is captured, are placed in the selected session. Such a session can either be used to capture additional information, by entering the applicable fields and then clicking a single button to create records for all the animals in the session. Secondly the animals in the selected session can be compared to the animals in a camp with differences displayed in a color coded manner. \n\nSynchronise with BenguFarm on your Computer\n\nWhen finished with recording, the information recorded on BenguFarm-MOBILE can be synchronised with the BenguFarm database to bring the data on the PC/laptop(s) up to date. With synchronisation, data recorded in BenguFarm on the PC/laptop is also updated on BenguFarm-MOBILE. Synchronisation of data can be done via Wi-Fi, Internet or a USB connection, depending on which method is available and the method preferred by the user. Synchronisation of data can be done via Wi-Fi, Internet or a USB connection, depending on which method is available and the method preferred by the user."

      "label": "5 Stars. “I can't tell you how often I use it, probably about as much as the phone app!\" \n- CharlieW, President. Waterman & Company (Real Estate Investment and Development)\n\n“This is the first 12C type calculator for the itouch that has actually made me put down my real 12C. One of the best features of this calculator is the register display where you can see what is in FV, I, PV, PMT, etc. That alone makes it worth the $14.95 price. Consider the many other features that it has over and above the real 12C and you have one sweet program here. Best of the 12C emulators out there - hands down! “\n- tsinvest\n\nIt started in early 2008 with a belief that:\n • there was one and only one insanely great financial calculator\n • the iPhone is the perfect platform to bring that calculator back to life\n • it's not good enough to just copy the old, you have to make it better\n • a financial calculator is a professional tool, not a game\n \nFrom this mindset came Calc-12E, the first 12C emulator on the App Store. It was expensive back then ($20-$25) and compared to a game it still is because, well, you usually get what you pay for. Specifically:\n\nForemost, if the math isn't right in the corner cases I can't trust the calculator. Calc-12E's algorithms were written for iOS by a (the?) key member of the original 12C development team who incorporated his solutions to the quirks in financial computation that historically tripped up lesser implementations. There are reasons the 12C was the absolute best, and Calc-12E draws directly on that heritage.\n \nWhile the original did what it could, 1980s technology made many features difficult, impractical or impossible to use. Calc-12E pioneered the following innovations to address shortcomings:\n    • you can always see what's in the financial registers (and stack if you choose) so you have instant assurance that you've entered your data correctly. This feature has been copied by nearly every emulator on the App Store, for good reason.\n    • visual cash flow editing radically eases how you deal with cash flows... believe it or not it is actually easy to manipulate cash flows with Calc-12E. There's a demo on YouTube, search for Calc12E.\n    • Investment mode allows you to simultaneously evaluate metrics on up to three cash flow scenarios at a time. You can compare cash flows side-by-side AND because of visual cash flow editing you can play what-if games\n    • the results of some calculations need to \"leave the phone\" to be useful. Amortization schedules, leasing terms, bond yields... everything can be sent via email using customizable templates\n    \nFinally, a professional tool receives continuing support and updates. It does not nag you to rate it, it does not invite you to pay to get more. It does not crash. Check out Calc-12E's version history and reviews of previous versions. This is a live, supported app with tens of thousands of long term customers and I have never charged for an upgrade or cloaked features behind ads or paywalls. It's not ethical at this level (in my humble opinion!).\n\nWhen you buy Calc-12E you get my best (and evolving!) rendition of the most popular handheld calculator ever made. It's core (the math) comes from the same mind as your trusty original and to that foundation you get usability advances that actually enhance the overall tool."

All for fraction of the cost of other consulting guides, and available anywhere you have your phone (full offline functionality).\n\nMemorizing frameworks is not good preparation for a consulting case study interview. You need to be at ease in the consulting case setting. Proficiency with 'case study math' is crucial for that. Use CaseBase to learn the techniques, practice the math, and put it all into use with case studies sourced from the leading consulting firms.\n\nFEATURES\n> Over 50 case pages sourced from recent Boston Consulting Group (BCG), McKinsey, and Bain interviews.\n> Automated answer checks for all calculation problems (precise and estimated). Recommended responses for free form questions.\n> Detailed explanations for each question and subsection, with step by step guide to each answer.\n> Intuitive interface, color graphics with each case.\n> Built to run offline. No wifi needed, no data used.\n> Tiny storage footprint. Consistently among the smallest apps on user devices. \n\nPRAISE FOR CASEBASE\n5-STARS\n“Great prep. As someone whose works in management consulting and has gone through tons of cases with applicants, I'll say this app is great preparation whether sitting down for a while to hammer on a case or quickly flipping through some mental math.”\n\nFrom the creators of CaseMath: Case Interview Math Prep.\n\nFull email support at support@caseinterviewprep.com\n\nFrom The Wall Street Journal:\n\n\"Mel Wolfgang, BCG's head of recruiting in the Americas, interviews about 100 students every year and says he can tell when someone sounds too \"scripted.\" \"It's sort of painful,\" he says, about hearing such responses.\"\n\nABOUT CASEBASE\nConsulting case interview preparation is wasted time if it takes the wrong form. Today’s most commonly used guides outline elaborate frameworks for the reader to memorize and detail point by point how candidates should present themselves. But when you approach each case and question with a prefabricated answer your responses become formulaic, not insightful. Almost without exception, this is painfully obvious to the interviewer.\n\nAs with any pursuit, the best preparation will focus on building a solid foundation. That means developing a close familiarity with the material and calculations you’ll face in consulting case study interviews as well as learning to form and articulate conclusions based on limited information. \n\nThis guide was designed to provide that sort of preparation. First and foremost it offers instruction and practice in the type of math that underlies these case interviews. Then, with the accompanying cases you will break down and solve actual interview questions sourced from leading consulting firms."

      "label": "The Fitzroy Readers is a set of graded books which employ the Fitzroy Method - a phonic approach to reading developed over the last 3 decades.\n\nThe first Reader, A Fat Cat, uses only 13 letters. This makes it easy for small children to start reading without delay.\n\nThe first five Readers each teach one basic vowel sound: a, e, i, o and u.  Repeated often, these vowels and many consonants become completely memorable.\n\nWithin Readers 1-10, special words like I, have, to, go, for…  are introduced – one  or two with each Reader.  Children quickly learn to read simple-sounding words wherever they see them.\n\nReader 9 teaches the first digraph, oo as in roof.  Digraphs enable children, without further teaching, to sound out whole families of words – including many they have never seen before.\n\nBy Reader 10, children are already reading simple sentences with fluency.\n\nThere are several sounding-out options available. All speech is high-quality recording. The interface is designed for young fingers and can be used by the student alone or with a tutor."

Find the hidden Numberblocks, add them together and see what happens. \n\n● Every time you get to Ten, you win something new to play with.\n\n► Play hide and seek! Tap on the Numberblocks when they poke their heads out.\n\n► When you have found two Numberblocks, drag one on top of the other to start the number magic. \n\n► Predict what will happen when you add them together - if you don’t know, take a guess.\n\n► Make the number magic happen yourself: drag both Numberblocks into the white shape. Watch the number magic happen.      \n                  \n► Keep finding more Numberblocks and adding them on until you make a Ten.               \n\n► An animation plays to celebrate every time you make Ten.         \n\n► You will also discover a new interactive plaything in the park. Try playing with it!\n\nAs you keep playing, the sums get gradually harder and the Numberblocks try out new number shapes. This helps children get better at recognising amounts on sight. If a Numberblock looks unfamiliar, try counting their blocks!\n\nKeep going to fill the park with playthings. After discovering all 20, you can restart the game and play again. Repeat play is a great way to get better at your number bonds and predicting which Numberblocks you will make."

This app is the perfect brain-trainer to help teach babies, toddlers, and children about sounds in the world.\n\nDo more than just give your kids a video to watch. Let them explore and learn with their senses.

Trumpets, birds, harmonicas, planes, lions, and more; there are so many sounds and items for your toddler or baby to explore! They will love playing this app and you will love sharing the memory with them.\n\nAvailable in over 35 languages, this app is designed to teach anyone anywhere what sounds are and where they come from. Allow children of any age to explore by himself or herself, or with a parent, and to experience that joy of learning."

Die toepassing het ‘n saamgestelde woordelys wat bestaan uit ongeveer 500 woorde. Hierdie woorde word verdeel in verskillende groepe van woordlengtes, wat aangepas word by die kind se spelsukses en -vermoë. Daar kan enige tyd ‘n spesifiek groep van woordlengtes geselekteer word vir beoefening. ‘n Resultaatstaat word aan die einde van elke woordgroep gepubliseer wat die ouer kan help om probleemwoorde te identifiseer. Spel Pret maak ook gebruik van fonetiese klanke om geheuevaslegging te versnel. Hierdie funksionaliteit lewer aan Spel Pret die unieke baanbreker verskil relatief tot ander soortgelyke toepassing in die mark.\n \nOns vertrou dat u kind Spel Pret sal geniet.

      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

      "label": "Open up the world-famous Peekaboo Barn, perfect for toddlers. \n\nInside the little bouncing barn, friendly farm animals are waiting to pop out and surprise your little one. Try and guess who they are; tap the doors to find out! More animals, animations, and sounds than ever.\n\nWork with your child to learn the names of animals and hear the sounds they make. Younger children will love opening the barn doors to find new animal animations, as they learn about cause and effect and become familiar with animal names and sounds. Older children will enjoy guessing animals by sound, then seeing the animal names, which helps develop early literacy skills.  \n\nMultiple Language Features:\n\nWe started with a child's voice in English. It's her real voice, which some kids really enjoy, but she does say \"wabbit\" and \"wooster.\" If this is a concern for you, you can switch to any of 12 adult voices; our adult narrators say everything clearly and perfectly, just like the teachers they are. You can try many languages from around the world—or record your own language, or grandma's voice. There are tons of ways to explore the languages of Peekaboo Barn!\n\nPress the Language button on the Options screen to try them out.\n\n—Choose from the built-in narrators: child's voice in young English; adult's voice in American English or Spanish.\n—World languages also included: Mandarin, Cantonese, Hindi, Japanese, Swedish, Dutch, Italian, German, French, Australian, and UK English. \n—Record your own voice: We added this feature so parents, children, and visiting relatives and friends can capture their own voices and star in Peekaboo Barn.  Now you can record the animal names in your native language--or grandma's voice, or grandpa's--and, if you're recording a new language, you can save the appropriate written version too, and both will show up the next time you play. (Please note, we can only support the writing systems that are supported by your device.)\n\nFEATURED BY APPLE \nOne of the first apps to be released for toddlers, since 2008 Peekaboo Barn has been downloaded over a million times, and played over 100 million times worldwide.  It has been a top 20 educational game on the iTunes store nearly every day since its launch, and has been featured by Apple often.  It won The Best Toddler App Ever award in 2009, and was named one of the top 50 iPhone apps for kids by Babble.com in 2010 and 2011.  It is recommended by The New York Times, MSNBC, USA Today, Wired, Telegraph UK, Ireland’s The Independent, Parents Magazine, and the Washington Post.\n\nPeekaboo Barn was made for you and your toddler by artists and educators, not marketers, robots, or companies repackaging clip art. Our team has backgrounds in cognitive science and child development, and we’ve worked in educational media everywhere from Penguin USA to the Smithsonian Institution. When you could really use a safe distraction--in airports, restaurants, and waiting rooms--or you'd like to try something new with your little genius, Peekaboo Barn is the educational, artful solution. Enjoy! \n\nIf you are looking for more Peekaboo, check out our awesome cousins: Peekaboo Fridge, Peekaboo Forest, and Peekaboo Wild.\n\nIf your kids are ready for a more complex game with the same great characters, please try Peekaboo Barn Farm Day! Many activities to try: for example, you can milk the cow, shear the sheep and llama, and pet the animals to help them fall sleep.\n\nFollow us on Facebook: www.facebook.com/nightanddaystudios. \nTwitter: @nightdaystudios \nYour privacy is important to us!

Choose your most trusted horse and head off for an adventure in the woods, where you can sleep under the stars in your sleeping bag, then wake up for a swim in the waterfall.\n\nTHE SHOP: When you need more horse tack, head over to the shop — you'll find everything you need.\n\nTRAVEL BETWEEN LOCATIONS\nEach location gives you access to the horse transport, so you can get your horses, equipment, bikes and even characters from here to there. Put what you want to move into the transport, close the door and select the new location by tapping an icon. Everything will arrive in the selected location so you can begin your next adventure!\n\nCREATE AN ORIGINAL VIDEO OF YOUR STORY\nUse the in-app recording feature to create an original video! This feature records your voice as you’re telling the story, along with your characters’ movements. Create videos up two minutes long and save them to your camera roll to share later!\n\nFEATURES:\n- Explore four locations: stable, arena, forest and shop.\n- Create stories for 24 new characters plus horses and other animals!\n- Care for your horses: feed them, lather them up till they're nice and clean, brush them. \n- Choose outfits from your favorite themes: medieval, western, everyday stable life and fantasy!\n- Hop on to ride bikes in the forest and race motorcycles in the arena!\n- Set up obstacles and show off your horse's jumping skills!\n- Eat at the food court and use the portable potties!\n- Have a campout! \n- Snuggle into your sleeping bag to stay warm under the stars! \n- Take a canoe ride or swim by a waterfall.\n- Make music with magical lily pads!\n- Move horses, characters and objects from here to there in the horse transport! \n- Record your stories in the app and share with your friends!\n- No time limit or high scores — play for as long as you like!\n- No third-party advertising\n\nWE LISTEN\nOne of our top requests for the Toca Life series has been horses!

      "label": "Hit the Button Math is an app designed to help develop mental math and calculation skills.\n\nThe app is aimed at 5-11 year olds. There are 166 different game modes of varying difficulty so it is useful throughout grades K-5. Answer as many questions as possible in minute-long games, or you can now practice without the pressure of a countdown timer - a feature which is new for 2019. Questions are randomly generated which means it is very replayable. The game has been carefully designed for children, with large, widely spaced buttons. We recommend that young children play on a tablet.\n\nSix main topics are covered: \n\n* Times tables - up to 10 or 12 \n* Division - up to 10 or 12\n* Square numbers\n* Number bonds\n* Doubling \n* Halving\n\nBetween these topics, the four standard arithmetic operations are covered: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.\n\nYou can create up to 30 player profiles per device to track an individual's high scores (increased from 15 in 2019). If you prefer there's also the option to play as a guest. All data is stored locally on your device so you don't have to worry about privacy issues. We've also made it very easy for children to quickly switch between profiles after playing a game, if they're sharing a device.\n\nAfter each game, the score achieved is displayed along with the child's high score. Bronze, silver or gold stars and trophies are awarded depending on the score achieved in each game."

      "label": "This guided meditation digital recording and book from New York Times best-selling authors Esther and Jerry Hicks explains  how \"getting into the vortex\" is essential for manifestation using the Law of Attraction. Gain an understanding of what the \"vortex of creation\" means and how you can use meditation to enter the vortex in order to allow the Law of Attraction to work for you. Also gain valuable insights about what happens to your affirmations and manifestation efforts when you are out of the vortex.  Five guided meditation audio sessions with music are included in this app.  \n\nListeners will be led by Abraham through four guided meditation sessions on these topics: General Well-Being, Financial Abundance, Physical Well-Being and Relationships.   Each guided meditation experience is 15 minutes long.   \n\nThis Vortex of Attraction Guided Meditation iPhone App is an exact duplicate of the physical product and includes the complete written text, and the complete audio recording along with an extra bonus track of guided meditation music which was not included with the original product.\n\nMany people exert manifestation and Law of Attraction efforts outside of the Vortex, and then conclude that the Law of Attraction \"doesn't work.\" Find out how to stop efforting and start allowing the Vortex of Creation to align you with the life you desire.  These are the first guided meditation recordings ever produced containing the Teachings of Abraham."

You can also check how a native speaker of the language you are learning could say a word in your language.\n\nA must-have for all language users but particularly for:\n\n* learners of foreign languages,\n* teachers,\n* actors,\n* singers,\n* public speakers,\n* businessmen.\n\nThis app is an ad-free version of (How to) Pronounce. You might want to test the free version in order to find out if the app suits your needs. The app uses a top-class text-to-speech system to generate speech which, in rare cases, may generate slightly inaccurate pronunciations."

The world of science just got a little bit weirder and a lot more fun with Toca Lab: Plants!\n\nJust like with the first app in the Toca Lab Series, Toca Lab: Elements, your curiosity will lead the way. Choose your plant, then visit five different locations in the lab:\n\n● Grow light: Shine the light on your plant and watch what happens! Does your plant bask and happily sigh in the light, or groan and wriggle away? What happens when you turn the light up a notch or two?\n\n● Watering tank: Put your plant in the tank and fill it up with water. Will your plant float? How does your plant behave when it’s soaking wet?\n\n● Nutrition station: What’s the optimal diet for your plant? Try the three different nutrition formulas and discover which ones your plant character likes!\n\n● Cloning machine: Spin the wheel on the cloning machine and before you know it, you’ll have five little versions of your plant. Wonder what the clones can do? Experiment and find out!\n\n● Crossbreeding apparatus: Here you can mix two plants to create something unexpected. Try it and see what happens!\n\nHave fun experimenting at each station to see how the plants evolve. Keep experimenting until you’ve collected all 35 plant characters in the app. Once you’ve collected a plant, keep experimenting to continue to evolve it! Who says kids can’t be scientists? Toca Lab: Plants brings out the budding botanist in everybody!\n\nFEATURES\n- Start with one plant and experiment your way to 35 different plant characters, each with its own unique personality!\n- Continue to evolve existing plants through experimentation!\n- Evolve plants with five lab tools: grow light, watering tank, nutrition station, cloning machine and the crossbreeding apparatus.\n- Discover plants from five groups: green algae, mosses, ferns, trees and flowering plants.\n- Learn the names and Latin names of real-life plants!\n\n--\n\nABOUT TOCA BOCA\nAt Toca Boca, we believe in the power of play to spark kids’ imaginations and help them learn about the world.

Control gravity to make characters walk or float. You decide how many lives they get.\n\nCREATE OR CHOOSE YOUR CHARACTER\nCreate your own ninja or ball. Pick character colors or add a photo and special effects. Or choose one of six unique characters or balls: Chompers, Jellyclops, Inky Brains, and more! Each has their own skills, strengths, and weaknesses. Be wise with your choices.\n\nTELL STORIES\nAdd words and thought bubbles to tell a story. Post signs, clues, and secret messages to help your character out. Add all kinds of sound effects: laughs, boos, cheers, and farts! Write your own messages for the end of the game: Super bummer if you lose. You are the champion if you win!\n\nPLAY YOUR OWN GAMES\nLet the gaming begin! Can you play as well as you make? Now’s the time to see. Run on a travelator, jump over hot lava, swim through water, and find the victory portal. Attack zombies, evil snails, and electromagnetic cats. Collect all the gold coins and glittery skulls. Is your game too easy? Go back and make it harder. Set the high score record! \n\nSHARE & SAVE ALL YOUR GAMES\nYou have your own video game showroom.

You can even create new exercises yourself!\n\nVIRTUAL MANIPULATIVES\nMathematics education organizations strongly advocate the use of manipulatives. They believe manipulatives allow students to actively construct their own understanding of math. Math Wizard is a new generation of virtual manipulatives which allows kids to explore math concepts.\n\nENGAGING FOR KIDS\nWe took special care to make the app fun and engaging so that children love manipulating the different terms of mathematical expressions!\n\nCUSTOMIZABLE \nMany settings are available to adapt the application to the child's level, including:\n\n • Numbers can be displayed using digits or beads that visually show the amount that numbers represent \n • Voice can be enabled to read numbers and operations aloud\n • Numbers available in the sandbox can be customized (the app handles positive and negative integers - up to 10 billion!)\n • Choose to allow inequality or force equality\n • Animation Speed\n\nYou can add as many users as you want, and view the activity history of each user\n\n-------------\nACTIVITIES\n-------------\n\n  Sandbox \n\nThe sandbox is an open-ended activity that allows users to experiment freely with algebra rules. You can add the numbers you want, and thus create and interact with any expressions or equations you want. \n\nFor parents and educators, it's a tool to show what are addition,  subtraction, equality and inequality. It also shows users how they can manipulate terms. For students, it's a tool to experiment with numbers in order to better understand \"how it works.\"\n\n  Exercises \n\nThe app contains hundreds of built-in exercises (additions, subtraction, equality, inequality, isolate a variable, brain teaser), but you can also create your own exercises!\n\nThe goal of each exercise is to reproduce an expression or equation (e.g., \"3\", \"4=4\", or \"x=3\") starting from another expression or equation (e.g., \"1+2\", \"2+2=3+1\", \"-1+x=2\"). This requires the child to interact with the numbers and operators in order to build their understanding of how algebra works (again, the child can only do what is permitted by algebra)\n\n---------------\n\nFEATURES\n\n  • Positive and negative integer numbers (up to 10 billion!)\n  • \"x\" variable \n  • Expressions with + and - operators\n  • Equality and inequality\n  • Division by 2\n  • Undo/redo operations and manipulations\n  • Unlimited number of users\n  • Record user activities\n  \nMany settings are available to customize the app, so it can fit the needs of both educators and students:\n\n • Number display mode (beads or digits)\n • Voice for numbers and operations\n • Custom numbers (Sandbox)\n • Do operations by dragging numbers on top of each other\n • Authorize inequality\n • Authorize division by 2\n • Animation Speed\n  \nFeel free to send us your feedback and suggestions so we can add them to the next update! support@lescapadou.com\n\nHave fun with algebra!"

      "label": "iCircuit 3D gives you an endless virtual workbench upon which to design and test your electronics projects. It combines the robust electronics simulation engine of the original iCircuit with the latest rendering and 3D physics technology of iOS.\n\nDon’t let the physical availability of parts be a constraint on your creativity! Choose from an expansive library of more than 150 physically and electronically simulated parts and over 1,000 reference boards to build and test your circuits for flaws, simulate your physical designs, and test your Arduino code in a fun sandbox environment. Each of these parts is adoringly rendered to look like the real thing so that you can enjoy the beauty of electronics.\n\nWhen powered, LEDs light up realistically, DC motors spin, and speakers make noise! Follow the flow of current along your simulated wires, and see pinout and color code data on the circuit components themselves. Tapping a part gives you quick access to simulated values such as voltage and current and also allows you to change the parameters of the part. In the event of a wiring issue or an over-stressed element, magic smoke will billow from the point of failure, making it easy to locate, diagnose, and fix errors. Add photographs and other reference images to the environment to keep them close at hand. You can even import your own 3D models to attach your electronics to, or use Blocks to build an enclosure, or a panel for them!\n\nFeatures:\n\n* Tons of resistors, capacitors, and LEDs\n* Multiple breadboard and wiring elements\n* Diodes, Transistors, and MOSFETs\n* DC power supplies\n* Waveform Generators to make AC, Square, and Sawtooth signals\n* Various batteries, including AA, AAA, 18650, and coin\n* Switches, including SPST and SPDT\n* Buzzers and speakers\n* DC motors and Servos\n* Programmable Arduino elements!\n* The full symbolic original iCircuit library\n* Over 1,000 reference circuit boards. These are not fully simulated, but are great for layout out your designs.\n* Import custom circuit elements in Eagle Board or Fritzing element formats (imported circuits won’t simulate, but you can at least wire them up)\n* Import custom 3D models to attach your projects to, and simulate their behavior on the workbench\n* Import images for reference or documentation, and they’ll appear as physical photographs\n\nAll of these are available in the 3D work environment that mimics an electronics workbench. When you add parts, they land on the table due to gravity. From there you can drag them around and connect them to each other by drawing wires between their ports. When a circuit is completed, they start simulating. Once connected to each other, wires stay connected no matter where the part is positioned. You can stick them to other parts to make panels and structures, or just leave them laying on the bench haphazardly, like I do. \n\niCircuit 3D was designed with a strong emphasis on fun and exploration and there are a lot more features along those lines to discover!\n\nI hope you enjoy this new take on circuit software."

      "label": "With Toca Kitchen Sushi, you’re the chef of a busy seaside restaurant. Customers come in, and you decide what they’re going to eat. Feel like slicing up squid, asparagus, and candy canes, and rolling it all up into a cone of seaweed? Go right ahead. Want to make stars and hearts of watermelon and mix them with fish and hot peppers? Make the roundest rice ball? You’ve got great tools for that right at your fingertips. With a fantastic array of ingredients, condiments, tools, serving dishes and some hidden surprises, you’re set for some serious play. \n\nOnce you’re finished cooking up something unexpected for your customers—it could even be totally gross if you want—sit back and see how they react. That might be the most surprising thing of all!\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Greet your customers, then head to the fridge to see all your fresh ingredients. Choose from rice, tuna, avocado, asparagus, squid, salmon, pepper, salami, radish, candy canes (no joke!), ginger, potato, tofu, shrimp and many, many more. If you’d rather stick to just veggies, switch to the vegan setting!\n\n- The shape machine is 1,000 light years ahead of a plain old rice cooker. Using the control panel, you can form any ingredient into different shapes, like an oval, square, or even a flower!\n\n- The rolling mat is where everything comes together. Whether it’s a sheet of seaweed, tofu or lettuce, you can roll up your ingredients into sushi, funky cones, giant burritos, you name it.\n\n- Want your food a bit well-done? Crank up the temperature on the frying pan and see what happens. \n\n- Hit the cutting board to slice up your ingredients or your sushi rolls. Your blade is masterful—it can cut through anything, like a huge fish or hard salami!\n\n- Once you’ve prepared your meal, it needs the perfect plate. Get artistic about it, arrange the food in perfect patterns, or make a huge, messy pile; even decorate with funny stickers. Do something extra and you may get a big reaction from your customers!\n\n- The dining counter is where your customers finally get to see your culinary creation, grab their chopsticks and dig in. Will their eyes brighten in delight, or will they make a grossed-out face?\n\nSo, what will you serve today?\n\n\nAbout Us:\nToca Boca creates digital toys and other playful products for kids around the world.

Fun for kids and adults alike and plenty of challenges at all levels.\n\n*Dinosaur Chess  by Mls968\nThis is a great program. The lessons are interesting, and play levels go from easy to difficult. My 4 and 6 year olds are learning the game, and it's helping novice players like my wife and I too. Highly recommended to anyone who wants to introduce their children to chess!\n\n*An excellent app   by Adg6\nA wonderful app. Ideal for anyone new to chess. It is even fun for experienced chess players.\n\n*Highly Recommended - by doled \n\"This is a fantastic chess teaching game. This game alone makes it worth buying an iPad. My three year old now knows the piece names and basic moves. My six year old is well on her way to playing a full game. Our family has had an iPad since the day the iPad was released and this is one of the best apps we have.\"\n\n*Great! - by TonySchleizer\n\"This game has gotten my 5 year old interested in chess. Great tutorials that get progressively harder as skills improve.\"\n\n\n* Great for getting started - by Milfordthelargebonedgorilla\n\"This has been fantastic for my five year old son...using this in addition to a real board and pieces has helped him immensely in understanding each of the pieces, how they move, their strengths and weaknesses...a terrific way to introduce young ones to the game without overwhelming them\"\n\n\n* Great learning tool - by Triplescoop \n\"I have an adopted 7 year old boy with fetal alcohol syndrome. It is very hard for him to learn to play games. Checkers was very hard for him to learn. I thought that chess would be something that he would have to wait to learn. I bought this app even though there were no reviews. So glad I did! What a great teaching tool! I love the mini games that teach the directions that each piece can move. We play slowly but my son can play chess! I recommend this for anyone who wants to learn the basics of the game. This app is for beginners. Great for kids! Thank you to the developers of this app!\"\n\n\n*Super! - by Chess player\n\"Hats off to the developers. A fun program for kids.\"\n\n\n*Ideal For kids - by Kingkot \n\"This game is ideal to teach the kids in the chess.\""

      "label": "As featured in Astronomy Now and Sky At Night Magazines!\n\nDouble Stars is an astronomy app for hunting down and resolving the beautiful double stars throughout the night sky. The app features a catalogue of hundreds of known double stars, and will identify for you which ones you will be able to see, and when, based on your location and viewing equipment. You can then take the app out into the field to help you locate the double star and record a successful sighting. \n\nHere's what our beta testers told us about the app:\n\n\"Great app and I'm loving the filter functions. It makes it so easy for me to decide my targets for the night!\"\n\n\"What a wonderful app. I had a brilliant time last night seeing double stars in Leo and Bootes, mostly new and some old friends\"\n\n\"a great app, well designed interface and a unique use for the iPhone's accelerometers and GPS\"\n\nInterested? Please read on...\n\nDouble star spotting is a pursuit everyone can enjoy with the just the naked eye or with advanced telescope equipment. For centuries, astronomers have enjoyed tracking down these objects and testing their eyes and the limits of their equipment. \n\nDouble Stars has a detailed catalogue covering both hemispheres and all 88 constellations. The catalogue covers the key data for double stars; the magnitudes of the pair, the separation of the pair, the positive angle and the location in the night sky. It also notes stars with colour variations and those that form part of a multiple system for 3 or more stars. \n\nUsing your location, the time and date, and the details of your observing equipment, the app will filter the catalogue, creating a bespoke list for your location and equipment.\n\n\"Smart Tours\" automatically create lists of the best doubles each night; your favourites, colour doubles, multiple systems, wide easy pairs, tough split pairs or by  constellation. In addition, you can create your own tour.\n\nOut in the field, the app operates in a special night mode allowing you to use it without ruining your dark adapted vision. All the key information you need is present – Double Stars even suggests an eyepiece to obtain the best magnification. \n\nThe app also features live Alt Azimuth tracking of the double star for those without GoTo equipment, and uses the inbuilt compass and gyroscope (where available) to point you in the right direction! Try attaching your iPhone to your telescope for precision control. The Sky Tour allows you to record which stars you have resolved. You can add the best double stars to a favourites list for later.\n\nAs the seasons change, revisit the night sky each month with Double Stars to see the pick of the delights of each constellation.\n\nWe really hope you’ll enjoy discovering and resolving new double stars with this app."

Pocket Universe is an easy-to-use app that will help you learn the names of constellations, bright stars, planets and more. You can literally hold up your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch in front of you, and the app will use the built-in compass to display the same view of the sky you see - but one that's complete with names and information. \n\nThen explore the Solar System, and take virtual walks on the surface of the Moon and Mars, before playing a game to help you learn more about astronomy that you thought possible.\n\nEvery night there is something to see: Pocket Universe will provide you a list of suggestions, as well as give you regularly updated news and observation tips - which you can even share with your friends.\n\nYou don’t need to be an expert to use Pocket Universe, and everything you see has a useful pop-up information window and links to Wikipedia for the latest information.\n\nWith over 80,000 stars, beautiful textures, built-in quiz games, updated news, lunar phases, information on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, an Orrery view, and more, there’s so much to explore.\n\nFor support or to ask a question, feel free to send a direct message on Twitter to @CraicDesign or email john@craicdesign.com.\n\nKey Features\n\nPocket Universe was the first iPhone astronomy app to support the built-in compass, and it was also the first to add a true augmented reality view using the iPhone's built-in camera! Use the camera view in the evening or morning sky to overlay the labelled view over the real sky.\n\nSimply hold up your iPhone in front of you, and the view will be exactly what you see - but with names and information at your fingertips. Move the iPhone around to see the view change in real-time. \n\nEasy-to-use astronomy application, which focuses on helping you answer the question \"What's that in the sky?\"\n\n• Works on all iPhones, iPads and iPod Touch devices running latest IOS\n\n• Supports augmented reality views that put the solar system in your living room, or all around you with 3rd party stereo headsets (available separately).\n\n• Tracks the International Space Station, and predicts sightings.\n\n• Tells you how long every day is, and tracks changes over the year.\n\n• Special \"Show Me\" mode will guide you to named stars, planets, constellations as well as the brightest galaxies and nebulae. \n\n• \"Tonight's Sky\" and \"Objects and Events\" will keep you up-to-date, and give you suggestions for what to look for when you head outside.\n\n• Constellation and Star Quiz to help you learn your way around the sky.\n\n• Works in Northern Hemisphere and ‘Down Under’ too.\n\n• Links to Wikipedia articles for the latest information.\n\n• Responsive customer support, frequent updates.\n\nPlease note: Network access is only required to view supplementary web-based news and Wikipedia text. This app never transmits data from your device.\n\n\nNote: Non-English localizations focus on solar system objects and constellation names."

Teach your toddler what an airplane, truck, and train sound like in a way that they will love.\n\nEach tile you touch opens up and reveals an exciting picture that plays a sound. The images rotate so that children can learn to identify the object, not just the single image that is shown.\n\nParents and children alike love this app and you will too! Download and play with your baby,\ntoddler or young children -- it's easy to learn and can entertain for hours.\n\nListen to the sounds made by both nature and machines. From boats, firetrucks, and\nhorse-drawn carriages to ducks, tigers, and birds. Each animal or object is like its own flash card; when opened, it plays a sound that is sure to stimulate each child and leave them with awe and wonder. This app is the perfect brain-trainer to help teach babies, toddlers, and children about sounds in the world.\n\nDo more than just give your kids a video to watch. Let them explore and learn with their senses. Parents of children with autism have found this app helpful in engaging their children, but truly it is for anyone that wants to teach their kids something new while stimulating and training their brains.\n\nEvery animal, transportation mode, and tile has five different sounds linked, so children can learn different sounds and images associated with objects. Trumpets, birds, harmonicas, planes, lions, and more; there are so many sounds and items for your toddler or baby to explore! They will love playing this app and you will love sharing the memory with them.\n\nAvailable in over 35 languages, this app is designed to teach anyone anywhere what sounds are and where they come from. Allow children of any age to explore by himself or herself, or with a parent, and to experience that joy of learning."

      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

      "label": "Open up the world-famous Peekaboo Barn, perfect for toddlers. \n\nInside the little bouncing barn, friendly farm animals are waiting to pop out and surprise your little one. Try and guess who they are; tap the doors to find out! More animals, animations, and sounds than ever.\n\nWork with your child to learn the names of animals and hear the sounds they make. Younger children will love opening the barn doors to find new animal animations, as they learn about cause and effect and become familiar with animal names and sounds. Older children will enjoy guessing animals by sound, then seeing the animal names, which helps develop early literacy skills.  \n\nMultiple Language Features:\n\nWe started with a child's voice in English. It's her real voice, which some kids really enjoy, but she does say \"wabbit\" and \"wooster.\" If this is a concern for you, you can switch to any of 12 adult voices; our adult narrators say everything clearly and perfectly, just like the teachers they are. You can try many languages from around the world—or record your own language, or grandma's voice. There are tons of ways to explore the languages of Peekaboo Barn!\n\nPress the Language button on the Options screen to try them out.\n\n—Choose from the built-in narrators: child's voice in young English; adult's voice in American English or Spanish.\n—World languages also included: Mandarin, Cantonese, Hindi, Japanese, Swedish, Dutch, Italian, German, French, Australian, and UK English. \n—Record your own voice: We added this feature so parents, children, and visiting relatives and friends can capture their own voices and star in Peekaboo Barn.  Now you can record the animal names in your native language--or grandma's voice, or grandpa's--and, if you're recording a new language, you can save the appropriate written version too, and both will show up the next time you play. (Please note, we can only support the writing systems that are supported by your device.)\n\nFEATURED BY APPLE \nOne of the first apps to be released for toddlers, since 2008 Peekaboo Barn has been downloaded over a million times, and played over 100 million times worldwide.  It has been a top 20 educational game on the iTunes store nearly every day since its launch, and has been featured by Apple often.  It won The Best Toddler App Ever award in 2009, and was named one of the top 50 iPhone apps for kids by Babble.com in 2010 and 2011.  It is recommended by The New York Times, MSNBC, USA Today, Wired, Telegraph UK, Ireland’s The Independent, Parents Magazine, and the Washington Post.\n\nPeekaboo Barn was made for you and your toddler by artists and educators, not marketers, robots, or companies repackaging clip art. Our team has backgrounds in cognitive science and child development, and we’ve worked in educational media everywhere from Penguin USA to the Smithsonian Institution. When you could really use a safe distraction--in airports, restaurants, and waiting rooms--or you'd like to try something new with your little genius, Peekaboo Barn is the educational, artful solution. Enjoy! \n\nIf you are looking for more Peekaboo, check out our awesome cousins: Peekaboo Fridge, Peekaboo Forest, and Peekaboo Wild.\n\nIf your kids are ready for a more complex game with the same great characters, please try Peekaboo Barn Farm Day! Many activities to try: for example, you can milk the cow, shear the sheep and llama, and pet the animals to help them fall sleep.\n\nFollow us on Facebook: www.facebook.com/nightanddaystudios. \nTwitter: @nightdaystudios \nYour privacy is important to us!

Depending on the child’s age, all animations and functions can run automatically or be controlled through a tap.\n\n7 interactive scenarios contain over 100 interactive animations and surprises:\n\n1. Steer the digger, fill the truck and repair the water pipe.\n2. Paint the house in different colours and unload the removals truck.\n3. Operate the crane and build a new roof for the house.\n4. Mix cement and build a real wall.\n5. Operate a big cement mixer and concrete a large area.\n6. Drive the street sweeper and clean the dirty road.\n7. Unload the crane truck and make sure it leaves on time.\n\nAmazing graphics, great animations, a user-friendly interface, no text and no in-app purchases.

      "label": "Hit the Button Math is an app designed to help develop mental math and calculation skills.\n\nThe app is aimed at 5-11 year olds. There are 166 different game modes of varying difficulty so it is useful throughout grades K-5. Answer as many questions as possible in minute-long games, or you can now practice without the pressure of a countdown timer - a feature which is new for 2019. Questions are randomly generated which means it is very replayable. The game has been carefully designed for children, with large, widely spaced buttons. We recommend that young children play on a tablet.\n\nSix main topics are covered: \n\n* Times tables - up to 10 or 12 \n* Division - up to 10 or 12\n* Square numbers\n* Number bonds\n* Doubling \n* Halving\n\nBetween these topics, the four standard arithmetic operations are covered: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.\n\nYou can create up to 30 player profiles per device to track an individual's high scores (increased from 15 in 2019). If you prefer there's also the option to play as a guest. All data is stored locally on your device so you don't have to worry about privacy issues. We've also made it very easy for children to quickly switch between profiles after playing a game, if they're sharing a device.\n\nAfter each game, the score achieved is displayed along with the child's high score. Bronze, silver or gold stars and trophies are awarded depending on the score achieved in each game."

      "label": "This guided meditation digital recording and book from New York Times best-selling authors Esther and Jerry Hicks explains  how \"getting into the vortex\" is essential for manifestation using the Law of Attraction. Gain an understanding of what the \"vortex of creation\" means and how you can use meditation to enter the vortex in order to allow the Law of Attraction to work for you. Also gain valuable insights about what happens to your affirmations and manifestation efforts when you are out of the vortex.  Five guided meditation audio sessions with music are included in this app.  \n\nListeners will be led by Abraham through four guided meditation sessions on these topics: General Well-Being, Financial Abundance, Physical Well-Being and Relationships.   Each guided meditation experience is 15 minutes long.   \n\nThis Vortex of Attraction Guided Meditation iPhone App is an exact duplicate of the physical product and includes the complete written text, and the complete audio recording along with an extra bonus track of guided meditation music which was not included with the original product.\n\nMany people exert manifestation and Law of Attraction efforts outside of the Vortex, and then conclude that the Law of Attraction \"doesn't work.\" Find out how to stop efforting and start allowing the Vortex of Creation to align you with the life you desire.  These are the first guided meditation recordings ever produced containing the Teachings of Abraham."

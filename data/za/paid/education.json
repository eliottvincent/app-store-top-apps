      "label": "It's never too late to expand your horizons, challenge yourself, and bridge the gap to another culture with Arabic Alphabet!\n\nArabic Alphabet teaches you the foundations of Arabic in a fun and unique way. For each letter you will be able to:\n\n• See it in great detail.\n• Hear the proper pronunciation of its phonemes.\n• Hear the proper pronunciation of its name.\n• See and hear a common Arabic word which begins with that letter.\n\nArabic Alphabet is not only fun, but it's also accurate because it was developed by a native Arabic speaker, and all audio samples were recorded by a college professor of Arabic.\n\n\"I was born and raised in Morocco with Arabic as my language of origin. When I moved to America, I wanted to be sure that I didn't lose my identity and my culture. After my first son was born, this became even more important to me as I want him to understand the importance of his heritage. I developed Arabic Alphabet so that adults and children alike could have a fun way to accurately learn the foundations of the language. I hope you enjoy it!\" —from the developer\n\nWe have finally added two in-app upgrades, so that you can expand your learning:\n\n• The Write feature which allows you to “finger-write” on the screen so that you can memorize and perfect the strokes for each character.\n• The Quiz feature which will help you put everything you’ve learned to the test.    With a little practice, you’ll learn to recognize and write the Arabic Alphabet in no time!"

Astronomical concepts are explained pedagogically step by step with various interactive elements that deepen the understanding.\n\n- How far is it to Jamaica?\n- When does the Sun go behind that house?\n- Where is Easter Island?\n- What time is it in New Delhi?\n- In which direction is Tokyo?\n- When is the next Harvest Moon?\n\nYou can get answers to these questions and many more by exploring and experimenting in the Sandbox mode of the app. Here you can visit all corners of the Earth and compare places with each other. This part is full of aha moments for both kids and grown-ups.\n\nThe app doesn't have a lower (or upper) age limit, but we believe that most curious kids under the age of 10 will need some kind of support from an adult. Fortunately, learning together works great!"

      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

      "label": "We received the \"Editor´s Choice\" award by Apple for \"Little Fox Animal Doctor\" And in addition our app was awarded the \"Tech with Kids' Best Pick Award\" for exceptional design of a children's app. \n\nLittle Fox has caught a cold. Can you help to find him a cure? The bat has broken its wing. Do you know what to do? \n\nWhether a bump on the head, a stomach ache from too much candy, a little wound, or a sunburn, these funny animals need the help of a really good doctor! \n\nFrom Oscar-nominated artist Heidi Wittlinger, the illustrator and director behind the bestseller Apps „Nighty Night“, „Little Fox Music Box“ and „Nighty Night Circus“ comes a wonderful new 3D-App which your child will love! \n\nThe app is full of humorous animations, amazing 3D illustrations, and funny short movies. In the animal doctor’s office, located in a magical treehouse, the animals are waiting to be cured. Kids are playfully guided through applying treatments that they might have experienced themselves: measuring temperatures, taking medicine, getting a plaster. And of course, eating a snail is probably just good for owls!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n\nHighlights:  \n\n1.There are 7 animals in the App - fox, bat, rabbit, mole, hedgehog, spider and owl, with 21 different injuries, sicknesses, and diseases.                                                                                                      \n2. Your child has many different treatments and medicines to choose from to cure the animals and make them happy again. \n3. Every time your child plays the App the animals have different illnesses, injuries and diseases.                                                                                             \n4. Little Fox Animal Doctor is the first 3D-App by Oscar-nominated artist Heidi Wittlinger. She is also the creative genius behind Nighty Night, Little Fox Music Box and Nighty Night Circus. Her Apps have been downloaded over 5 million times worldwide.                                                                                                                                  \n\nThe App will make your children’s dreams of being an Animal Doctor come true!\n\nAbout Fox & Sheep:\nWe are a Studio in Berlin and develop high quality apps for kids at the age of 2-8 years.

      "label": "Welcome to Expedition White Shark, the world’s first app designed to track adult white sharks in real time! To make this possible, scientists at the Marine Conservation Science Institute (MCSI) attached custom satellite tags to the dorsal fin of adult Great White Sharks, allowing us to follow their movements from Satellites orbiting the earth. Expedition White Shark allows you to receive near real time Great White Shark tracking data at the same time as the research scientists. Positions for the tagged sharks can only be calculated when a shark is at the surface with its dorsal fin out of the water for several minutes; since sharks are not always finning we receive intermittent position data from our sharks, but each signal beamed to us form space adds to our growing knowledge of the life history of this species. Since you are getting our data in near real time you will notice that the satellites sometimes make mistakes, placing the shark far from its actual location; we correct these errors later, when we analyze the data. The MCSI satellite tagging of Great White Sharks has led to many important new findings regarding white shark biology, and each new day brings promise of a new discovery that you can make with us!\n\nUse the shark filter to select a specific shark or see the last position for all sharks of a specific species, or select current to see shark positions within the last 30 days. If current is selected the last position for a shark that appears on the map as a dorsal fin , while sharks with historical location data on today’s date in previous years are marked with dot. This allows users to look for patterns of where sharks may be found during that time of year.\n\nKeep up with the latest research insights posted by Dr. Michael Domeier and Nicole Nasby-Lucas, by following us on Facebook www.facebook.com/MarineCSI and Instagram @marinecsiorg."

Tap on the Numberblocks when they poke their heads out.\n\n► When you have found two Numberblocks, drag one on top of the other to start the number magic. \n\n► Predict what will happen when you add them together - if you don’t know, take a guess.\n\n► Make the number magic happen yourself: drag both Numberblocks into the white shape. Watch the number magic happen.      \n                  \n► Keep finding more Numberblocks and adding them on until you make a Ten.               \n\n► An animation plays to celebrate every time you make Ten.         \n\n► You will also discover a new interactive plaything in the park. Try playing with it!\n\nAs you keep playing, the sums get gradually harder and the Numberblocks try out new number shapes. This helps children get better at recognising amounts on sight. If a Numberblock looks unfamiliar, try counting their blocks!\n\nKeep going to fill the park with playthings. After discovering all 20, you can restart the game and play again. Repeat play is a great way to get better at your number bonds and predicting which Numberblocks you will make."

      "label": "Geometrics is a powerful tool that is used by students and professionals throughout the world! From real estate agents in Australia to construction estimators in Canada!\n\nThe app constructs two-dimensional shapes when provided a minimum set of dimensions and then calculates area and perimeter. Shapes can be saved and combined with others to effectively calculate the area of any irregular shape. Geometrics can e-mail a report of the saved shapes and the total area! \n\nGeometrics supports these common two-dimensional shapes: \n\n• Circular: circle, ellipse, segment, sector, ring sector \n• Triangles: right, equilateral, isosceles, acute, obtuse \n• Quadrilaterals: square, rectangle, trapezoid, parallelogram, rhombus \n• Polygons: triangle to icosagon (20-sided) \n\nCircle circumference and area is shown numerically or in terms of π. Special 30-60-90 and 45-45-90 triangles can be constructed with areas and perimeters calculated in terms of √3 or √2. Hexagon perimeter and area is shown numerically or in terms of √3.\n\nGeometrics becomes a powerful productivity tool by managing a group of saved shapes. With a simple tap, the app remembers the shape just solved and then sums the saved shape areas to provide a total area. Saved shapes can be viewed and edited at any time. Each saved shape can be scaled to a fraction of its original area, and even can be subtracted from the total area. These features allow Geometrics to construct any arbitrary shape, including those with a “punch out”. \n\nIf there is a need to calculate the area of an irregularly shaped concrete patio with a tree growing in the middle of it, let Geometrics do the hard work. To figure out how much area needs to be covered by mulch in intricate landscaping, Geometrics is up to the task! To know how big of an area will be painted in a great room with complex, vaulted ceilings, look no further than Geometrics to provide the answer. \n\nOnce saved shapes are edited and arranged to calculate the proper total area, Geometrics can e-mail a report of the saved shapes and the total area. The e-mail contains a table that makes it easy to copy/paste the data into a spreadsheet program. \n\nWatch the video tour on our web site!"

      "label": "Wonderfully updated Beatrix Potter books, with graphic adaptations of there wonderful illustrations come with option \"Read to Me\" or \"Read Myself\".  They are accompanied by soothing background music.  There are also activity pages that come from the illustrations that can be colored, printed, saved and/or shared via email to your family and friends.\r\n\r\nPeter Rabbit- Wonderful told tale, loved for 100 years by children the world around.  The story follows Peter after he disobeys his mother and goes to Mr. McGregor's garden instead of going to pick blackberries with siblings: Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cotton-tail. Mr. McGregor tries to catch Peter, but he narrowly escapes. To get home safely, Peter must run past Mr. McGregor and get to the gate. He slips safely under the gate, but he has lost his jacket and his shoes. He runs home, where his mother puts him to bed and gives him a dose of chamomile tea.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Bunny- The Tale of Benjamin Bunny is the fourth book made in Beatrix Potter’s “Peter Rabbit” series. The story, follows Peter’s cousin Benjamin as he convinces Peter to come to Mr. McGregor’s garden to get Peter’s clothes back. This tale is a great follow up to the classic “Peter Rabbit.”\r\n\r\nThe book starts off with Benjamin Bunny watching Mr. and Mrs. McGregor going out for the day and he decided to get his cousin Peter to come along with him to Mr. McGregor’s garden to get Peter’s clothes back.\r\n\r\nJemima Puddleduck- Jemima is a  duck living on a farm whose eggs are always taken by the farmer's wife because she believes Jemima would be a poor mother. Jemima searches for a place away from the farm where she can hatch her eggs without interference, and naively tells her woes to a suave fox who invites her to nest in a shed at his home. Jemima accepts his invitation, little realizing her danger: the fox plans to kill and roast her. Kep, a collie on the farm, discovers Jemima's whereabouts and rescues her just in time.\r\n\r\nFlopsy Bunnies-  Yes, this is how Beatrix Potter spelled their name! The Flopsy Bunnies are sometimes careless when they've stuffed themselves with lettuce, and this time, it endangers their very lives. That old Mr. McGregor, he really hates bunnies in his garden, but he doesn't mind selling their skins for tobacco! How will Benjamin and Flopsy's \"one, two, three, four, five, six leetle bunnies\" escape from Mr. McGregor's sack?  Book is filled with these strange old english words, but that is part of the fun of the story.\r\n\r\nThank goodness for Thomasina Tittlemouse, who arrives just in time to save the day! And those spunky Flopsy bunnies, they are more curious than they are scared (or are they more reckless?), because they follow Mr. McGregor right up to the windowsill of his home to see what happens next!"

      "label": "PitchBop is a melodic ear training app designed to help you improve the connection between your ear and your instrument by directly linking the level of skill to the accuracy of your performance.\n\n\nWHAT PITCHBOP DOES DIFFERENTLY\n\nUnlike most ear training apps where you answer by tapping on a screen without addressing the rhythmic aspect of what you hear, PitchBop offers a performance-like scenario where you listen and actually play your instrument or use your voice.\n\nUsing the 'Call and Response' model, Dr. Bop, the resident jazz cat of PitchBop, plays a short phrase for you to listen to and allows you the same amount of time to repeat the phrase back to him to evaluate the accuracy of your performance.\n\n\nHOW PITCHBOP WORKS\n\nBehind the simple interface, there is a complex algorithm based on AI which creates endless melodies and adjusts the difficulty according to your progress.\n\nUsing the 'Call and Response' model, Dr. Bop plays a short phrase for you to listen to and allows you the same amount of time to repeat the phrase back to him to evaluate the accuracy of your performance. Once the session is complete, you receive feedback on how well you did, and the difficulty level is set based on your performance so you can focus on playing without needing to worry about adjusting the settings.\n\n\nAPP FEATURES\n\n+ Pitch Complexity\n\nPitchBop creates calls with varying levels of pitch complexity on a scale of 1 to 9. Use this slider to set the complexity level.\n\n+ Rhythmic Complexity\n\nUse this slider to set the rhythmic complexity level between 1 and 9.\n\n+ Choose Your Instrument\n\nTap the instrument name to see a list of instrument choices, then tap the name of your instrument to automatically set your available range. PitchBop can be used with a wide variety of instruments, including your voice.\n\n+ Metronome Settings \n\nSet the metronome volume and choose if you want it to give you all four beats, one and three, two and four, or whichever combination of beats you prefer.\n\n+ Profile Tab\n\nVisit the Profile Tab to study your progress. This information is only stored for Dr. Bop’s Game, however, not for Practice Mode.\n\nAdditional details can be found by tapping the up and down arrows next to “Scale” to select the various scale and harmony types PitchBop uses for the calls and it will report the success rate and the Pitch and Rhythmic Complexity in your most recent “Call-and-Response” session.\n\n+ Practice Mode settings\n\nPitch Complexity\nRhythmic Complexity\nTempo\nScale\nRange\nAlways start on root on/off\nNumber of calls per session\nSwing/Even\nChromatic notes on/off\n\n\n\nADDITIONAL GAME DETAILS BEFORE YOU START \n\n1. Pay attention to the octave \n\nYour response must be in the same octave as Dr.Bop’s Call in order for it to be registered accurately. If it isn’t, even if the note is correct, you will see a lower score due to the incorrect octave. \n\nExample: For level 1 (when both sliders are all the way to the left) the starting note for the piano is C4 (the middle C). For the guitar, it is C4 as well (first fret on the B string or 5th fret on the G string)\n\n\n\n2. Pay attention to the rhythm\n\nWhile the app may be called PitchBop, rhythm is still a big part of the game. Users should make sure to pay attention to the rhythm and try to be as accurate as they can in matching it. Responses played out of rhythm will lower your score. \n\nIf the Calls feel a little too challenging, you can move the sliders all the way to the left and try starting from there. If this still feels like more than you’re comfortable with for now, you also have the option to go to the “more” tab and adjust the range to be as narrow as an octave.\n\n\n3. Bluetooth and external devices\n\nDue to the diverse and often unpredictable nature of external devices, PitchBop is designed to use the device’s microphone and speaker. \nBluetooth compatibility, however, will be addressed in a future update.\n\nFor any other questions please contact us at support@pitchbop.com"

      "label": "If you loved our First Phrases and Picture the Sentence apps, you’ll love this app too! Fun with Verbs & Sentences is the next step up for children who are learning to speak in sentences, understand past and present verb tensing, and formulate basic syntax structures.\n\nThis app is developed for language ages 2-5 with eye-popping color drawings and 266 delightful animations--a cutting-edge way to show and teach action words! For a demonstration of this app, please check out our YouTube video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUcYWlJ27yw .\n\nThis app is for the iPhone and is our “full” version. It provides a fun way to visually show left to right sentence building (early literacy concepts) and sequence the parts of a sentence in the right order. This full version allows up to 75 users and groups and data tracking.\n\nWant to show animations simply to elicit sentences and verb forms? Just select the \"Watch & Say\" activity--also a great pre/post assessment tool. Select the verbs from 39 choices or random, and decide which syntax forms you want to target.\n\nBut this app does more! Play the \"Build a Sentence\" activity:\n1) Choose your subject: There are three character choices in this app: a boy, a girl, and a bear.\n\n2) Then choose your verb: The next step is choosing something for the girl to do. (There are always 3 picture choices, such as draw, jump, or eat). Let's choose \"draw\".\n\n3) Choose your object or prepositional phrase: The last step is choosing something for the child to draw. (Choices for draw include: cat, spider, or cat).\n\n4) The narrator now voices each part of the sentence slowly, as the circles flip around, one at a time, to reveal the associated pictures: “The girl…is drawing…a cat.” Unless de-selected, the narrator will then model the sentence at a quicker speaking pace, “The girl is drawing a cat.” The child is complimented for the sentence and then instructed, “After the video, it will be YOUR turn to say the sentence.”\n\n5) The animation that shows the sentence that was created (i.e., “The girl is drawing a cat”) is now shown, typically with a sound effect. If the verb is present tense, (which is the default) it snaps back and loops continually, without sound.\n\n6) The child is asked, “What is happening? Tell me the whole sentence.” The circles below can be tapped to show the associated pictures or tapped again to hear the associated audio. The child taps “Record” and tries to formulate the target sentence, then touches “Stop”.\nThe child listens to the target phrase by touching a “Check” button that pops up, and compares to his own recording. If used in therapy, the data tracking features on the left can be used. (This can be de-selected within the settings if no desired)\n\n*If past tense verb forms have been selected, the animation is shown only once and the narrator asks, “What happened?” If the user would like to target the verb only, this can be selected in the settings, with the question being asked, “What is the girl doing?” (or “What did the girl do?” for past tense)\n\n7) A reward game can be played at desired intervals, the “Pop It!” Game. The child touches bubbles on a screen until a selected “prize” is found.\n\nPRIVACY POLICY: We do NOT collect personal data from our users and have no ads. Personal data regarding user performance on the tasks on this app are self-contained and not transmitted in any way, unless the user chooses to email them to someone else. There are no in-app purchases in this app. A demo link will allow a user with internet access to view a video on YouTube to learn about the features of this app, as well as a link to our other apps in the iTunes store.\n\nDeveloped by licensed speech-language pathologist and author, Patti Hamaguchi, M.A., CCC-SLP.

This simulation uses changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide over the first 20 years of the 21st century to project temperature changes into the future (to the year 2100). If the rate of change over the last 20 years continues unchanged, then carbon dioxide will accumulate in the atmosphere causing the planet to warm and sea levels to rise.\n\nControl settings allow you to simulate the result of changing the sources of energy production. Increasing the use of green energy and burning less fossil fuel will slow global warming. Settings for energy conservation and carbon capture are also available for each simulation.\n\nView the detailed graphs to explore the results of increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide. Occasionally popups will display \"tipping points\" or other consequences of the warming.\n\nClimate change is real and global warming is happening now. However, it is a complex subject that is difficult to get your head around. Hopefully, this app will encourage you to explore the global warming in depth and then do what you can to mitigate the consequences.\n\nThis simulation assumes that the increased concentration of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere causes global warming.

Because Solar Walk knows what time it is, the planets are in proper orientation to the Sun: Earth is dark where it is currently night and gradually lightens to daytime on the other side.” - NY Times\n\n\"It's great for showing my students the relative positions of the planets in the solar system, the satellites orbiting the Earth and our place in the galaxy. Awesome with a smartboard as well.\" - by jbrown61\n\nSolar Walk enables you to:\n\n► Observe 3D model of our Solar system with all its objects in real time and in a ​proper orientation. Turn into an astronomer and explore planets, moons, satellites, asteroids, dwarf planets, comets, stars and other celestial bodies. Enjoy gorgeous graphics and visuals while navigating through the solar system!\n\n► Make virtual flights from one space object to another.\n\n► Travel in time and see what the universe and our Solar system looked like at a certain period.\n\n► Find an exciting view of the Milky Way Galaxy.\n\n► Watch a collection of educational solar system movies to learn about space-related topics including Earth's moon phases, Earth's cycles, tidal phenomena, and zodiacal constellations.*\n\n► Enjoy 3D planetarium with the help of special glasses and activating the anaglyph mode.\n\n► Share interesting screenshots of the app with your friends.\n\n► Choose the view mode comfortable for you (orrery/true-to-scale).\n\n*Available through In-App Purchases.\n\nSolar Walk is a great educational tool appropriate for both adults and children. The amount of information users can learn about the planets, moons, satellites and other celestial bodies is impressive. Information is age appropriate, detailed and animated video clips make learning our solar system even more engaging!\n\nThe entire Solar system can be explored with Solar Walk app!"

Daar kan enige tyd ‘n spesifiek groep van woordlengtes geselekteer word vir beoefening. ‘n Resultaatstaat word aan die einde van elke woordgroep gepubliseer wat die ouer kan help om probleemwoorde te identifiseer. Spel Pret maak ook gebruik van fonetiese klanke om geheuevaslegging te versnel.

      "label": "Open up the world-famous Peekaboo Barn, perfect for toddlers. \n\nInside the little bouncing barn, friendly farm animals are waiting to pop out and surprise your little one. Try and guess who they are; tap the doors to find out! More animals, animations, and sounds than ever.\n\nWork with your child to learn the names of animals and hear the sounds they make. Younger children will love opening the barn doors to find new animal animations, as they learn about cause and effect and become familiar with animal names and sounds. Older children will enjoy guessing animals by sound, then seeing the animal names, which helps develop early literacy skills.  \n\nMultiple Language Features:\n\nWe started with a child's voice in English. It's her real voice, which some kids really enjoy, but she does say \"wabbit\" and \"wooster.\" If this is a concern for you, you can switch to any of 12 adult voices; our adult narrators say everything clearly and perfectly, just like the teachers they are. You can try many languages from around the world—or record your own language, or grandma's voice. There are tons of ways to explore the languages of Peekaboo Barn!\n\nPress the Language button on the Options screen to try them out.\n\n—Choose from the built-in narrators: child's voice in young English; adult's voice in American English or Spanish.\n—World languages also included: Mandarin, Cantonese, Hindi, Japanese, Swedish, Dutch, Italian, German, French, Australian, and UK English. \n—Record your own voice: We added this feature so parents, children, and visiting relatives and friends can capture their own voices and star in Peekaboo Barn.  Now you can record the animal names in your native language--or grandma's voice, or grandpa's--and, if you're recording a new language, you can save the appropriate written version too, and both will show up the next time you play. (Please note, we can only support the writing systems that are supported by your device.)\n\nFEATURED BY APPLE \nOne of the first apps to be released for toddlers, since 2008 Peekaboo Barn has been downloaded over a million times, and played over 100 million times worldwide.  It has been a top 20 educational game on the iTunes store nearly every day since its launch, and has been featured by Apple often.  It won The Best Toddler App Ever award in 2009, and was named one of the top 50 iPhone apps for kids by Babble.com in 2010 and 2011.  It is recommended by The New York Times, MSNBC, USA Today, Wired, Telegraph UK, Ireland’s The Independent, Parents Magazine, and the Washington Post.\n\nPeekaboo Barn was made for you and your toddler by artists and educators, not marketers, robots, or companies repackaging clip art. Our team has backgrounds in cognitive science and child development, and we’ve worked in educational media everywhere from Penguin USA to the Smithsonian Institution. When you could really use a safe distraction--in airports, restaurants, and waiting rooms--or you'd like to try something new with your little genius, Peekaboo Barn is the educational, artful solution. Enjoy! \n\nIf you are looking for more Peekaboo, check out our awesome cousins: Peekaboo Fridge, Peekaboo Forest, and Peekaboo Wild.\n\nIf your kids are ready for a more complex game with the same great characters, please try Peekaboo Barn Farm Day! Many activities to try: for example, you can milk the cow, shear the sheep and llama, and pet the animals to help them fall sleep.\n\nFollow us on Facebook: www.facebook.com/nightanddaystudios. \nTwitter: @nightdaystudios \nYour privacy is important to us!

Drive the street sweeper and unload the truck crane!\n\nOn our construction site your child can drive a digger, mix cement, roof a building, operate a crane, drive a street sweeper or paint a house. There’s so much to do here. Our Little Builders dig, plaster, fill, paint and mix... And they need your children´s help.\n\nAt the same time they can watch funny things happen, because on every building site there’s always something going wrong. Water suddenly bursts from a pipe, a builder falls into a hole or the wind blows the bricks away because the cement wasn’t dry yet.\n\nLittle Builders is the first 3D app for children aged 2-6 years that want to explore the world of being a real little builder. Depending on the child’s age, all animations and functions can run automatically or be controlled through a tap.\n\n7 interactive scenarios contain over 100 interactive animations and surprises:\n\n1. Steer the digger, fill the truck and repair the water pipe.\n2. Paint the house in different colours and unload the removals truck.\n3. Operate the crane and build a new roof for the house.\n4. Mix cement and build a real wall.\n5. Operate a big cement mixer and concrete a large area.\n6. Drive the street sweeper and clean the dirty road.\n7. Unload the crane truck and make sure it leaves on time.\n\nAmazing graphics, great animations, a user-friendly interface, no text and no in-app purchases. Download now and start building!\n\nPlease also check out our other great Apps for kids:\n\n„PETTING ZOO“ - is a fantastic storybook app for the iPad and iPhone.

      "label": "Hit the Button Math is an app designed to help develop mental math and calculation skills.\n\nThe app is aimed at 5-11 year olds. There are 166 different game modes of varying difficulty so it is useful throughout grades K-5. Answer as many questions as possible in minute-long games, or you can now practice without the pressure of a countdown timer - a feature which is new for 2019. Questions are randomly generated which means it is very replayable. The game has been carefully designed for children, with large, widely spaced buttons. We recommend that young children play on a tablet.\n\nSix main topics are covered: \n\n* Times tables - up to 10 or 12 \n* Division - up to 10 or 12\n* Square numbers\n* Number bonds\n* Doubling \n* Halving\n\nBetween these topics, the four standard arithmetic operations are covered: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.\n\nYou can create up to 30 player profiles per device to track an individual's high scores (increased from 15 in 2019). If you prefer there's also the option to play as a guest. All data is stored locally on your device so you don't have to worry about privacy issues. We've also made it very easy for children to quickly switch between profiles after playing a game, if they're sharing a device.\n\nAfter each game, the score achieved is displayed along with the child's high score. Bronze, silver or gold stars and trophies are awarded depending on the score achieved in each game."

      "label": "This guided meditation digital recording and book from New York Times best-selling authors Esther and Jerry Hicks explains  how \"getting into the vortex\" is essential for manifestation using the Law of Attraction. Gain an understanding of what the \"vortex of creation\" means and how you can use meditation to enter the vortex in order to allow the Law of Attraction to work for you. Also gain valuable insights about what happens to your affirmations and manifestation efforts when you are out of the vortex.  Five guided meditation audio sessions with music are included in this app.  \n\nListeners will be led by Abraham through four guided meditation sessions on these topics: General Well-Being, Financial Abundance, Physical Well-Being and Relationships.   Each guided meditation experience is 15 minutes long.   \n\nThis Vortex of Attraction Guided Meditation iPhone App is an exact duplicate of the physical product and includes the complete written text, and the complete audio recording along with an extra bonus track of guided meditation music which was not included with the original product.\n\nMany people exert manifestation and Law of Attraction efforts outside of the Vortex, and then conclude that the Law of Attraction \"doesn't work.\" Find out how to stop efforting and start allowing the Vortex of Creation to align you with the life you desire.  These are the first guided meditation recordings ever produced containing the Teachings of Abraham."

Share the songs you loved as a child with your children and experience anew the sheer delight of a child's earliest musical encounter.\n\nThe child you love will love listening to the songs with the fun vocal track or they can sing-along by themselves. \n\nThe simple animated lyric pages add to the fun. It’s a great app for young kids of kindergarten age. It also encourages early reading and exploration. \n\nSix songs for the price of one on the iTunes store. \n\n• 12345\n• ABC\n• Incy-wincy spider \n• Row row row your boat\n• 3 little monkeys \n• Twinkle twinkle little star\n\nListen to a clip from our website before you buy, at www.kidzongs.com\n\n-----\n \n- \"The best trip companion ever. My kids love it (3 years and 7 months old), its the only thing that keeps them calm. My 7 month old stops crying instantly as soon as the music starts. Everyone in the family now has this app, even grandma!\" – by Pablus1\n- \"I love this app, my little boy started singing and dancing as soon as the program started. I recommend it to all.\" – by Nola D\n- \"My 21-month-old can use this app all by himself! Love the voices of the performers! Don't hesitate to purchase it.\" – by BTA'smom\n- \"My two-year-old son really enjoys music so I was excited to find this app. The music is really cute and the little animations keep him entertained. This is a great find!\" – by turtlesmom79\n \n-----\n\nA big thank you to everyone who has downloaded Kidzongs and Kidztory animated interactive children's stories and told us how much you like them by leaving comments on the app store.

From sunup to sundown, Toca Life: Farm is fun on the farm!\n\nEXPLORE LIFE ON THE FARM\nThe four locations in Toca Life: Farm will give you everything you need to tell your farm stories. Tend to the animals in the barn — feed them and clean up their poop! Once you've taken care of the animals, head to the house, where you can have a meal then grab your banjo for an impromptu jam session. After a good night's sleep head out to the field to tend to your crops. Harvest your produce and head to the store, where you can sell your food, make new products and buy goods!\n\nTURN YOUR HARVEST INTO FOOD\nPlant your seeds and find out how to make them grow! Tinker with your tractor to see what it can do! The food machine magically turns your raw ingredients into food: Use milk to make cheese, then use the cheese and corn to make cheese puffs! Use berries to make jam, wheat to make bread, and then use those ingredients to make donuts! Discover all the foods you can make and how you can make them!\n\nCREATE AN ORIGINAL VIDEO OF YOUR STORY\nUse the in-app recording feature to create an original video! This feature records your voice as you’re telling the story, along with your characters’ movements. Create farm videos up two minutes long and save them to your camera roll to share later!\n\nFEATURES:\n- Explore four locations: barn, house, field and store.\n- Create stories for 29 new characters plus all the animals!\n- Feed the animals, milk the cow and gather eggs from your hens.\n- Bottle the milk from the milk tank.\n- Help the vet check the animals.\n- Let the pigs (or people!) wallow in the mud.\n- Clean up different types of animal poop!\n- Grab the banjo, fiddle, guitar or washbucket bass and jam into the night!\n- Pick fruit in your orchard.\n- Farm your crops from planting to harvest.\n- Use your tractor's different functions to farm faster!.\n- Fire up the food machine to turn your harvest into food.\n- Record your stories in the app and share with your friends!\n- No time limit or high scores — play for as long as you like!\n- No third-party advertising\n\nWE LISTEN\nSo many of you asked for a farm in the Toca Life series, and we're excited to give you what you want!

We were working on the pro forma balance sheets and cash flows for a new project I'm working on.  They were all asking why I had switched to the iPhone for I used to be a die hard \"brandX phone\" fan. I said that one could do so much more. They said \"yea...sure\" (they were all using \"brandX phones\") until I started using your calculator. We were analyzing different payment and amortization schedules. They were so impressed by how easily we could figure out the amount of interest, principal and remaining loan balance for any certain period or combination of periods that in the end they were saying \"I have to get me one of those\".   Great product. Thanks.\""

Professional! Highly Recommended... finally the currency application I have been waiting for so long...\"\n\n◆◆◆◆◆ \"...I tried all other similar apps, and I am proud to announce that this app is simply the best of them all..\"\n\n◆◆◆◆◆ \"Smart, intuitive and flexible!... slick interface with great functionality which further impresses with its great selection of currencies and immediate updates. Good job! Highly recommend!\"\n\nFeatures:\n\n-- Simple Interface -- \niCurrencyPad was designed to be fast and easy to use. Just select the currencies to convert and tap in the amount to convert. A convenient calculator allows for basic math calculations, showing the results as the values are tapped. Swipe across the display to swap the left and right currencies, or swipe up and down to select different currencies. Tap and hold to copy/paste. \n\n-- Favorite Currencies -- \nWhile iCurrencyPad offers exchange rates for 160+ currencies from around the world, you may be interested in only a few currencies. To reduce clutter on the screen, iCurrencyPad allows you to select and sort your Favorite Currencies, so only those currencies that interest you appear on the screen, thereby making the application easier and faster to use. \n\n-- Charts -- \nDetailed charts show the history of exchange rates for any two currencies. Tap on the chart for the exchange rate on any particular day. Tap with two fingers to show the change in rates between any two dates. Rotate the device for a larger chart in landscape view. Charts for most currencies are available for 1-day, 5-days, 3-months, 6-months, 1-year, 2-years, 5-years and 10-years. \n\n-- Exchange Rates Listing -- \nThe exchange rates listing shows a base currency compared to all other currencies, similar to the electronic exchange rate boards seen in \"Change\" shops around the world. \n\n-- Exchange Rates Updates -- \niCurrencyPad updates Exchange Rates on demand, or automatically at pre-defined intervals ranging from 15 seconds to 1 day. Exchange Rates are automatically updated when the app is launched, or auto-updates can be turned off when roaming. An Internet connection is required to update rates, either via cellular network or a Wifi connection. Without a connection, rates can still be accessed and converted using the last data downloaded. \n\n-- Easy to Get Started -- \nA short 20-second tutorial will play when you first launch iCurrencyPad and guide you through the app's features. \n\n-- Languages -- \nThe user interface is offered in 9 languages: English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Russian, Chinese, Japanese and Arabic. Please visit the App Store in your language for a translated description and screenshots.\n\n-- Reviews -- \n\"...iCurrency Pad is a great piece of software powered by a stunning design and usability. It’s beautiful, useful, powerful yet simple and straightforward...\" \n\n-- MacStories (http://bit.ly/94Y9IT)"

      "label": "Loan Calculator Pro is an easy to use financial calculator.  Within seconds, you will be able to calculate the monthly payment for different types of fixed rate loans such as home mortgage, auto, and credit card.  You can calculate \"what if\" scenarios to determine how additional monthly and yearly payment will help you to pay off your loan earlier and save money in interest.  In addition, you can use Loan Calculator Pro to track all your extra payments at any amount and at any point in the life of your loan.\n\n\nFEATURES\n\n* Early Payment Simulation\nSee how much interest you will save and how early you will pay off your loan by entering extra payment amounts per month and/or per year.\n\n* Extra Payment Tracking\n- Loan Calculator Pro will let you track all of your extra payments in variable amounts throughout the life of the loan.  For example, it will let you track an extra $100 in principle on the first payment, an extra $300 on the 5th payment, and an extra $1000 one the 10th payment, etc.  This way, the application will still be useful long after you have purchased your property and will let your know exactly where you are with all your loan payments.\n\n* Fast Calculations\n- Loan Calculator Pro is designed to be fast.  Calculations are done instantly after you enter each amount field.\n\n* Large Numeric Keypad\n- The large keypad allows for easier, faster, and more accurate entry of numeric amounts.\n\n* Amortization Table\n- A complete payment schedule allows you to view the amount, interest, principal, and remaining balance for each and every payment of the loan.\n\n* Bookmark of Payments\n- You can bookmark the current payment you are at in the amortization table and the application automatically scroll to the memorized payment the next time.\n\n* Saved Loans\n- Loan Calculator Pro lets you save and organize all your various loans in a list so you do not have to enter the information over each time.  It will also remember and opens up the last saved loan you worked on.\n\n* Loan List Reordering\n- You can reorder the loans from the saved list in any order you choose.\n\n* Email Export\n- Export loan information and payment schedule via email.\n\n* Passcode Security\n- Passcode protection to keep your loan information private.\n\n* Backup / Restore\n- Backup your data to your computer for safekeeping.  Then restore it to your iOS device when you need to via the iTunes file sharing interface.\n\n* Intuitive User Interface\n- Special attention was given to the user interface to ensure that it is clean, intuitive, and easy to use."

The built in calculator lets you focus on two selected currencies on one screen. The built in calculator remains on the screen at all times making data entry quick and easy.\n\nApple Watch\nUse Currency+ on the Apple Watch. See your favorites currency list and your Currency Alerts directly on the watch.\n\nToday Widget\nUse the Today Widget to quickly see the conversion rates between all your favorite currencies. Tap the rate to reverse the conversion. Tap any of the currencies on the list to set as the base currency.\n\nSupport For Over 150 World Currencies & Precious Metals\nFor times where you want to keep track of many currencies at one time, the favorites list is where you need to go. You pick from  over150 world currencies and precious metals (powered by Yahoo.com). Selecting any currency in your list, enter a value and the rest of the currencies in your list will show you that amount in their own currency in real time.\n\nHistorical Charts\nCurrency+ has historical charts. You can view historical currency conversion charts for any two currencies. Touch the chart with a single finger to see data from any period in the past. Touch the chart with two fingers to compare currency exchange rates from any two past periods. Show charts for 1 day (real time intraday), 5day, 3 month, 6 month, 1 year, 2 years and 5 years.\n\nCurrency Trends\nWith Trends, you can select any of the 150+ world currencies and compare it to a list of other currencies to see how it has performed over time. See if your currency has strengthened or weakened. Select your time period from days to years. Export your work to an email, text, note, etc using the trend share sheet.\n\nBackground Rate Updates & Currency Alerts\nCurrency+ will go out and update your currency rates without taking your device out of your pocket. Whenever you open Currency+, your data will always be up to date. Do you want to be notified when a currency goes above or below a certain value? If so, Currency+ can notify you of these changes without the need to open the app. You will receive a push notification on your device whenever the currency you are watching goes beyond the limit you set.\n\nEditable Calculator Tape\nCurrency+ has an integrated calculator tape that keeps track of everything that you do. You can send any value from the tap to any of your favorite currencies. You can edit/delete/insert tape values and your calculations will automatically update. Finally, you can put comments on any of your tape values to help you keep track of what your numbers stand for.\n\nInverse Currency Calculations\nNeed to do inverse or reverse currency calculations? Currency+ can switch between standard and inverse currency conversion modes on the fly.\n\nTransaction Fees or Taxes\nCurrency+ can factor in transaction fees (or tax) automatically. Individuals rarely convert money at published exchange rates - most banks and exchange offices charge a fee. Enter the transaction fee percentage to give you a better estimate of your 'real' conversion rates.\n\nMake the leap with Jump Gap Software's Currency+, the currency converter that takes you around the world and back."

It takes advantage of price correlation between various Forex pairs. Currency strength is measured for 8 currencies (USD, JPY, EUR, GBP, AUD, NZD, CHF & CAD) and is reported on a scale of 0 (weakest) to 10 (strongest). \n\nCurrency strength data provides the trader with important insights into the forces at play causing a move on a particular Forex pair. For example, if GBP/USD suddenly trends upwards following an economic news announcement (e.g. US Non-Farm Payroll), the currency strength values would immediately indicate whether the move was due to generalized GBP strength or USD weakness.\n\n\nFeatures:\n\nStreaming currency strength data feed - fast updates, low latency. Accurate and reliable\n\n8 currencies and 4 currency strength time-frames. Currency strength resolution down to 1 min on lower time-frames.\n\nBar Chart. Multiple time-frames, history viewer feature, real-time max/min highlighting.\n\nLine Chart. For real-time and historical data. Multiple time-frames, zoom. Customizable currencies, gridlines etc.\n\nDark Mode support (requires IOS13+)\n\nMultiple bar chart color themes.\n\nAdjustable chart Time-Zone. Match the time-zone to your Forex charts.\n\nBuilt-in Help / User Guide. Detailed description of all features.\n\nPriority Support.

Non financial data, such as the change in mileage and average fuel consumption can also be calculated, and displayed in brief or in detail. \n\nA carbon footprint can also be calculated, depending on the consumption of the vehicle, as well as the mass of carbon dioxide (CO2) it produces (total and average per day and per mile traveled). \n\nCar Manager also allows all these data (costs, fill-ups, vehicle information) to be exported and sent by e-mail directly from your iPhone as a CSV file (comma separated values, which can opened and processed by Excel or any other spreadsheet program), should you feel the need to create your own personalized statistics. \n\nThe application also enables you to manage a directory containing all the information about the service providers for your vehicles: insurance companies, garages, stores, clubs, associations, etc. You can then easily locate them thanks to the Maps interface. \n\nCar Manager also provides you with a Tools section, which allows you to geolocate your current position or your parking spot in a single click, so you can easily go back there later with the integrated GPS visual guiding function (or with Maps directions). This tools section can also help you find various services around your location: gas stations, garages, restaurants, hotels and others. \n\nCar Manager also gives you the opportunity to stay tuned to car news: it comes with a number of RSS feeds (internet information channels) allowing you to be informed of anything related to cars and motorsports.

You can see how these and other parameters like your current savings, will affect how much you will have at retirement as a multiple of your salary at retirement (under the assumptions entered and no uncertainty). \n\nThe living annuity calculator allows you to flex the consumption of your savings at retirement (or any other savings), and will calculate how long your savings are expected to last (again, under the assumptions entered and zero uncertainty). Alternatively, you can now see the results of hundreds of stochastic simulations for the real returns (where I've assumed a return distribution for each level of real return).\n\nYou can also see a full payment or savings schedule, and each calculator has its own help / info screen.\n\nFinally, there is a full financial calculator that allows you to not only perform regular calculations, but also financial calculations (including solving for any of the five inputs, namely: term, interest rate, present value, periodic payment, and future value - given the other four)."

After entering your debts in the application, you can analyze how the choice of payment strategy or different extra amounts helps you pay off your debts sooner, and save on the total interest paid.  Debt Strategy supports multiple strategies such as:\n\n- Minimum Payments Only\n- Lowest Balances First, with rollover of payments from paid off loans\n- Highest Interest Rate First, with rollover of payments from paid off loans\n\nDebt Strategy helps you to take control of your debts. Pick one debt, either one with the lowest balance or one with the highest interest rate, and focus on paying it off first by paying a little more than the minimum. This will shave months off your debt. With your other debts, continue paying just the minimum. After you finish paying off the first debt, move on to the 2nd debt per your strategy. Roll over the amount you paid each month from your first debt to pay off this one. You will pay off the second debt even more quickly. Continue this strategy until all your debts are paid.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Ability to enter debts and track debts.\n- Ability to identify the best pay-off strategy, and perform what-if analysis with different additional amounts and pay-off strategies\n- Graphical view of how the debts will be paid off\n- Pie/Bar charts for debt break down by category, or remaining balance\n- Monthly payment schedule for each debt\n- Ability to enter payments during the life of the loan, and accurately track remaining balances\n- Payment reminders so you can make your payments on time\n- Ability to override the home currency\n- Option to email a report\n- Password protection"

      "label": "The forex market is available for trading 24 hours a day. However, this doesn’t mean it’s always active throughout the whole day. Most successful traders understand this and choose to trade during times when market activity is high and avoid times when trading is light. Spreads are tighter during these periods and currency movements backed up by high trading volume are more likely to follow through. \n\nForex Hours Pro provides a quick overview of the status and local time of major forex markets in the world. At those overlapping trading hours it is likely you will find the highest volume of trades and therefore more chances to win in the foreign currency exchange market. The status and local time are updated in real-time thus no refresh is required. \n\nIn addition, you can also choose to receive notifications/alerts when your favourite market open and closed. \n\nThis Pro version has no ads.\n\nJoin our facebook fan page. \nhttp://www.facebook.com/codingtrader \n\nFor technical support / enquiries, please email our technical support team at codingtrader.sg@gmail.com\n\nNote: \n\nThis application assumes local trading hours of 8:00 AM - 4:00 PM in each Forex market from Monday to Friday excluding holidays as most participants trade between these times in their local time zone. \n\nThe current version of Forex Hours Pro comes with the 5 major markets.  If there is a Forex market which you wish to be included in this app, do drop us an email for evaluation and we may include it in our next update.  =)\n\n******* IMPORTANT NOTE ******* \nPlease visit http://www.codingtrader.com to view the new screenshot for this new update."

This app provides 1) quick identification and interpretation of current market trading direction, 2) a complete reference on 100+ Japanese Candlestick patterns, and 3) two training games to build your knowledge of charting patterns.\n\nCandice helps you quickly find the possible Japanese candlestick patterns in a chart from input of the trading situation. No more looking through numerous graphic images to match or memorizing what each pattern means. Enter specific values to find possible matches and then see the trade action. Patterns can also be found by name, prior trend, signal type (bearish/bullish), number of candles, or marked favorites. Each candle pattern provides image, name, signal, reliability, rating, trend, colors, how to recognize, recommended trade actions, and your own custom notes.\n\nCandice employs a visual table of contents as well as a full index dictionary name reference. Caveat notes are provided as a separate extendable database on chart patterns as well as other references.\n\nCandice comes with three game study operations: Flashcards, Guess and Press, and Slide Show to learn candle patterns. You can configure which patterns to learn or all of them."

      "label": "\"Catan\", the legendary strategy game provides gaming fun anytime, anywhere.\n\nTrue to the original game, you can compete with up to four players for the most settlements, the longest roads and the largest army. You can trade with each other and claim the precious land with all its resources.\n\nThe game allows you to challenge other Catan fans online via cross-platform multiplayer to prove your strategy skills or play against the AI:\nVarious computer opponents, each with their own individual characteristics, will prove themselves worthy competitors: the pirate Jean, who knows no compromise, Vincent the merchant, who never allows himself to be cheated, Sean the knight, who takes what is rightfully his...\n\nThe popular Catan expansions \"Seafarers\", \"Cities and Knights\" and two new special scenarios are available as In-App purchases.\n\nThe complete Seafarers expansion includes more than 10 additional scenarios with an extensive campaign. Become Harbormaster, discover new islands and extra game elements like ships, gold fields, treasures and pirates. Ahoy!\n\nThe Cities and Knights expansion introduces various new gameplay mechanics that add even more variety to Catan. Invest new trade goods in city improvements to build one of the three metropolises of Catan – but beware of the barbarians attracted by Catan’s new wealth! You’ll need your best knights to fend them off! C&K contains a short campaign and 7 challenging maps.\n\nExciting adventures await you in the two new scenarios \"Enchanted Land\" and \"The Great Canal\". Vanquish dragons and bag their treasures or build a canal to help barren grain fields bloom once more.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Available languages: English, German, French, Dutch, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese\n- Original \"Settlers of Catan\" rule set\n- Update 4.0+: Synchronous online multiplayer games\n- Smart computer opponents with individual strategies\n- Scrollable game board including zoom option \n- Freely combinable game settings \n- Game statistics\n- Comprehensive tutorial\n- Seafarers LITE: New scenario \"The 4 Islands\" and two additional game variants\n- Cities and Knights LITE: Test the new expansion in the scenario “The first Island”\n- 3 different graphic sets to choose from\n\n\n***** \nCatan FAQ: \n\nQuestion: An expansion seems gone after an update or reinstallation of Catan or after restoring the device? \nAnswer: Don’t worry! Your initial purchase is already saved in your iTunes account. You can restore your InApp purchases by selecting the restore-option in the Catan IAP menu. \n\nQuestion: I lost my campaign progress after reinstalling, updating or restoring my device. Is there any way to restore it? \nAnswer: When saved games can’t be automatically restored, we’ve integrated a cheat code: In the campaign mode go to select player and enter „CatanWarp*“ (* = 1–15) as your player name and confirm. Exit the game via the home button and restart it. The campaign can now be continued from the specified level number (1–15). Levels up to the specified number will be unlocked in the custom game mode as well. \n\nQuestion: Are dice rolls really random? \nAnswer: Of course! All dice rolls are 100% random and not modified in any way. We’re avid Catan players ourselves. We’ve played the iOS version hundreds of times while developing the program. There have been times when we won and lost a few games in a row because of the dice - just like when playing the board game! \n\n*****\nQuestions or suggestions for improvements: \nMail to ios@usm.de \nWe are looking forward to your feedback! \n\nFor more information on news and updates: www.usmgames.com \nor visit us on www.facebook.com/UnitedSoftMedia and twitter.com/USM_News \n\n*****"

      "label": "NOTE: Remastered version from the PC version. A device with at least 2 GB of RAM is required for this game to run properly.\n\nWelcome to your new summer job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, where kids and parents alike come for entertainment and food as far as the eye can see! The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman.\n\nFrom your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if Freddybear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed!\n\nCan you survive five nights at Freddy's?\n\n\"For all the simplicity of the game’s controls and premise, Five Nights at Freddy‘s is frightening. It’s a fantastic example of how cleverness in design and subtlety can be used to make an experience terrifying. Simple still images and proper character design steal the show in this game, and show that Scott Cawthon knows quite a lot about the secret fears people feel when looking at creepy dolls and toys. It’s elegant in how it sows fear, and is a must-own for anyone who likes scary games.\" -Joel Couture IndieGameMag.com\n\nNOTE: Interface and audio in English. Subtitles in English, French, German, Dutch, Spanish (Latin America), Italian, Portuguese (Brazil), Russian, Japanese, Chinese (Simplified), Korean.\n\n#MadeWithFusion"

Playing as a child whose role is yet unknown, you must safeguard yourself until 6am by watching the doors, as well as warding off unwanted creatures that may venture into your closet or onto the bed behind you.\n\nYou have only a flashlight to protect yourself.

If something has crept too close, then shining lights in its eyes will be your end.\n\nNOTE: Interface and audio in English.

Thus, the operation is only done to people on their deathbeds, to fulfill what they wish they had done with their lives, but didn’t.\n\nThis particular story follows their attempt to fulfill the dream of an elderly man, Johnny. With each step back in time, a new fragment of Johnny's past is revealed. As the two doctors piece together the puzzled events that spanned a life time, they seek to find out just why the frail old man chose his dying wish to be what it is.\n\nAnd Johnny's last wish is, of course... to go to the moon.\n\nMORE DETAILS\n\"To the Moon\", a story-driven RPG with pixel graphics, was originally developed six years ago for PC by Canadian producer Kan Gao and Freebird Games, his indie game studio.Rights to develop and publish the remastered mobile version of \"To the Moon\" were acquired by X.D. Network Inc.\nThe story of \"To the Moon\" unfolds before players, much like a movie. While the entire game has no battle system and can be completed in a few hours, the compelling story and moving original soundtrack resonated with players worldwide. On top of receiving overwhelmingly positive ratings, \"To the Moon\" received multiple awards from Gamespot, Metacritic, WIRED, and more, and was nominated for \"I'm Not Crying, There's Something In My Eye\" in the 2016 Steam Awards.\n\nKEY FEATURES\n•\tUnlocked 29 new iMessage stickers.\n•\tAdded \"Music Box\" function, allowing backstage music playing& in-game music downloading(will be enabled automatically after clearing the stage).\n•\tAdded \"DIY QR code\" function, allowing one-key sharing of player data for playing on different devices.\n•\tA unique & non-combat story-driven experience\n•\tInnovative mix between adventure game elements and classic RPG aesthetics\n•\tAcclaimed original soundtrack that closely ties to the story\n•\tAn espresso execution with zero filler and no time drains\n\nLanguages Supported: \n* English \n* Français \n* Deutsch \n* Español (Latinoamérica) \n* Español (Europa) \n* Português \n* Polski\n* lingua italiana (Italian)\n* Người việt nam\n* русский(Russian)\n* 한국어 (Korean) \n* 简体中文 (Simplified Chinese) \n* 繁體中文 (Traditional Chinese) \n* 日本語 (Japanese)\n* Türk dili(Turkish)\n* Українська（Ukraine）\n\nFacebook: /TotheMoonHD\nTwitter: @TotheMoonHD\nService email: TotheMoon@xindong.com\n\n© 2017 X.D.

Her destiny is mysteriously linked to that of Peter, a young filmmaker covering a military expedition in the 1950s and Simon, a sailor of the Franklin expedition struggling to keep his crew alive.\n\nNavigate through time to discover what links them together. Search for ideas, instill them in the characters' minds and guide them toward Nanurluk, the mythical polar bear who lived 10 000 years ago.\n\nA Mystical Time Travel Experience\nGo on an adventure in the far North of Canada, navigate through the ages, and interact with the past to change the present. In Inua, you’ll need to unravel space-time to solve mysteries and guide the characters on their journey. Move from scene to scene, era to era, and uncover events of the past, unearthing new ideas that influence the characters' minds. Help Simon, Peter, and Taïna overcome the obstacles standing in their way, and change the course of history.\n\nA Historical Saga\nThe original and supernatural scenario of Inua is based on a very real story: that of the Franklin expedition, a British mission in the 19th century to explore the Arctic that resulted in shipwreck, disease, and mutiny. The fate of this expedition is still largely unknown. Gather clues and discover its history!\n\nInua - A Story in Ice and Time:\n- A fantasy tale based on incredible historical facts..\n- An extraordinary story inspired by Inuit tales and legends, with support from Inuit writer Thomassie Mangiok and advisors Billy Gauthier and Monica Ittusardjuat.\n- A game designed by the creators of Bury Me, My Love, and Vignettes, adapted from the original story by Nathalie Frassoni and Frédéric Bouvier, with the breathtaking artistic direction of Delphine Fourneau from the Klondike collective."

Earn points by overtaking traffic cars, you need them to open the new vehicles, modes and other features of the game.\n\nThis racing simulator gives you the ability to choose the style of driving that can be tranquil and safe or extremely racing. The abundance of settings allows you to customize a level of car physics realism, from arcade and simple to the most realistic, as in the difficult racing simulator in which you will need to show your driving skills.\n\nRecord your gameplay videos and share them to your friends in social networks with Everyplay Service. You can edit recorded video replays and comment them using the camera and microphone on your device.\n\nFeatures:\n- Modern beautiful graphics;\n- Car tuning and customization feature;\n- Realistic car physics;\n- Change the time of day in real-time;\n- Qualitatively modeled German cars;\n- 4 tracks with different weather conditions;\n- First person view / cinematic / interior camera.\n\nWarning! This game is quite realistic, but it is not designed to teach you how to street racing. Be careful and responsible when you're driving real car. Enjoy virtual driving in heavy car traffic, but please observe the traffic rules and be careful on real roads."

      "label": "We Spot! is my simple clone of the popular Spot It! card game, but with a twist. Unlike the game on which it's based, We Spot has four difficulty levels and correspondingly larger deck sizes. \n\nThe object of the game is to find the one (and only one) matching symbol between any two cards. It's shockingly simple and at the same time surprisingly challenging. The more symbols on the cards, the harder and longer the game will be.\n\nFirst, choose the number of symbols you want on each card:\n4 (Easy): 13-card deck.\n6 (Medium): 31-card deck\n8 (Hard): 57-card deck (this is the closest to the original Spot It! game)\n12 (Extreme): 133-card deck\n\nNext, select what fraction of the complete deck you want to play: full, 1/5, 1/4, 1/3, or 1/2 deck. Choosing a smaller deck will make the game shorter, of course.\n\nNow the fun begins. The cards are dealt two at a time. You have approximately one second for each symbol on a card. The faster you find the match, the higher your score for that pair of cards. Incorrect picks will penalize you some of that time. When your time expires, you will only get a minimum score.\n\nYour score for each pair of cards is shown at the top of the screen while the next pair of cards is dealt. Your total score is shown at the bottom left side of the screen. The number of cards remaining in the deck is shown at the bottom right.\n\nWhen you're done, your total score is displayed, along with the option to share your success with the world on your favorite social media account.\n\nI originally wrote this game for two reasons: \n1. I wanted to learn more about animations.\n2. I am horrible at the Spot It! card game and thought this would help me practice.\n\nI hope you enjoy the game as much as I do. Depending on how well it does, I hope to add more gameplay modes and possibly even a multiplayer option."

Please see details on our website at http://oxigenator.com/products/camcarder/ . We suggest that you connect your iPhone to a power, rather than using it on a battery.\n\nSo if your phone receives an incoming call or you want to switch to another app, CamCarDer will save current clip. You can start new clip manually, or set application to auto-start it when application goes back to foreground."

Mae'n ased cenedlaethol a hwn yw mynydd mwyaf poblogaidd y Deyrnas Unedig o ran ymwelwyr. Mae'n denu pobl o bob cwr o Gymru, y DU, ac o bob rhan o'r byd.\n\nDyluniwyd yr ap gan Awdurdod Parc Cenedlaethol Eryri a phartneriaid gweithgar sy’n cynnwys cynrychiolwyr o sefydliadau sydd â dyletswydd ymarferol o reoli’r mynydd ar lawr gwlad. Mae’r gwaith yn amrywio o reolaeth cadwraeth a llwybrau i dwristiaeth, ffermio ac achub mynydd.\n\nMae’r ap yn hawdd i’w ddefnyddio, yn gweithio gyda GPS ac yn cynnwys mapiau manwl sy’n dilyn eich taith wrth i chi gerdded ar unrhyw un o’r 6 prif lwybr i’r copa. Mae hyn yn gweithio all-lein, sy’n golygu nad oes angen cyflenwad i’r we neu signal ffôn tra’n ei ddefnyddio ar y mynydd. Mae pob map yn cynnwys cyfuchliniau fel y gallwch gadw golwg ar ddarnau anodd wrth i chi gerdded.\n\nFe fydd yr ap yn eich helpu i gynllunio ymlaen llaw cyn eich ymweliad ac yn cynnwys cyngor pwysig fydd yn eich galluogi i’n cynorthwyo i barchu, gofalu, a gwarchod y mynydd, yr amgylchedd o’i amgylch, a’r cymunedau lleol.\n\nYn cynnwys data AO © Hawlfraint y goron a hawl basdata 2020.\n\nDatblygwyd yr ap gan Tiny Mobile Limited ar gyfer Partneriaeth Yr Wyddfa. Cysylltwch â paul@tinymobile.co.uk os oes diddordeb gennych mewn datblygu ap cerdded.\n\n\n\n\nYr Wyddfa (pronounced uhr-with-va) is a globally renowned, iconic mountain and home to vibrant, energetic communities and a mosaic of upland hill farms. It is a national asset, the most visited mountain in the UK, attracting people from across Wales, the UK and around the world.\n\nThis app is designed by the Snowdonia National Park Authority together with partners who are responsible for the on-the-ground management of the mountain. The work ranges from conservation and path management to tourism, farming and mountain rescue.\n\nOur simple to use GPS-enabled app covers the 6 main paths to the summit of Yr Wyddfa with detailed route maps that tracks your progress as you ascend. This works offline, meaning no internet or phone signal is required when using the app on the mountain. Each map also includes contour information so you can look out for hazardous sections as you climb.\n\nThis app will also help you plan ahead before your visit and includes important advice which will allow you to help us respect, care, and protect this incredible mountain, the surrounding environment and local communities.\n\nContains OS data © Crown copyright and database right 2020.\n\nThis walking app was developed for Partneriaeth Yr Wyddfa by Tinymobile Limited. Email Paul on paul@tinymobile.co.uk if you would like to discuss walking app development."

      "label": "The first and only Vector Magnetometer on the iPhone - Visualize the hidden world of magnetism around you in 3 dimensions (3GS or later!)! It can be perfectly used to explore and measure the direction and strength of the magnetic field of random objects around you (which can be quite fascinating!). With limitations (see docs) it can be used as a metal detector to find electric lines or pipes in walls (always good to check a wall before drilling in, at least better with this than not to check at all). Another application is to use this tool as a rough estimate of your north-south position on earth without using the GPS(!) - just by measuring the local earth magnetic declination (it works fine even while flying in a plane to check how the declination changes). Or simply explore your next Christmas present before opening it! Send us your results!\n\n\nThe application has four different displays modes to visualize the magnetic field:\n\n- Absolute Mode: Displays the absolute magnetic field in microtesla (μT) measured by the magnetometer.\n\n- North Mode: A compass head-up displays the geographic north along with the pointer that directs to the magnetic north (thus display difference magnetic to geographic north).\n\n- Declination Mode: Two arrows will be displayed to indicate the declination of the earth magnetic field (0° just on equator, increasing to north with blue pointer direction up or south with blue pointer direction down). \n\n- Relative Mode: This mode shows the relative strength (absolute minus compensation vector) of the magnetic field in μT. \n\n\n… and five different display modes for acceleration visualization: \n\n- Absolute Mode: Displays the reverse acceleration of the iPhone (1g up when hold steady). \n\n- X-Rotation - Y-Rotation - Z-Rotation: The arrow will display the rotation around the X-, Y- and Z-Axis of the iPhone. The digital indicator shows the angle numerically (-180° - +180°). A way to calibrate will be added with one of the next updates, so you could use this as a level.\n\n- Relative Mode: This mode shows the relative strength (absolute minus compensation vector) of the acceleration.\n\n\nFor a detailed documentation, please visit our product homepage. \n\n\nFor recreational use only. However it CAN (!) be very accurate. The measurement is performed as good as possible (we try our best) by using the inbuilt accelerometer and magnetometer to their limits. The range of the accelerometer typically has a max of ±3g (~4.2g displayed here if combined) and each magnetometer usually recalibrates internally when over ±120μT in one axis. However, tell us your experience!"

The same data is written into the metadata record of images, making image files self-contained data records. Third-party apps can tap into Theodolite's advanced camera functions with a camera sharing feature.\n\nView current position on the built-in map with optional offline Outdoors maps that include topo contours, roads, trails, landmarks, campgrounds, ski lifts, and more. Live map markers continually update distance/heading relative to the current location and also show wayfinding info in the main viewfinder. Draw polygons on the map to mark things like property boundaries and trails, and import/export polygon data via KML.\n\nShare map markers and nav calculator points with other users of Theodolite via text messages or e-mail. This powerful capability opens up a wide range of collaborative uses including team land surveying, accident investigations, spotting wild fires, triangulation of landmarks, and advanced tactical observation and targeting. With an optional in-app purchase to enable team tracking, you can share location with up to 20 people on Theodolite's map.\n\nTheodolite includes features for serious users like a reference angle mode, nav calculator, map marker import/export, manual and automatic data logging with CSV and KML export, clipboard integration, %grade display, mil compass readout, optical rangefinders (including a mil-based reticle, sniper-style stadiametric graphs, and a variable 4X-24X scope), and night filters to improve use in dark conditions.\n\nTheodolite can provide location in military grid reference system (MGRS) coordinates, Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates, British/Irish National Grids, US National Grid, Maidenhead locator system, Map Grid of Australia, and six latitude/longitude formats. Optional US State Plane coordinates include SPCS27 and SPCS83 zones covering all US States. The optional Datum Pack adds over 230 geodetic datums to the app to improve position computation from GPS data, covering regions and countries on all continents around the world.\n\nAR Layers include navigational aids like the sun, moon, planets, and Polaris (North star), and the optional US Mountain Summits layer that shows over 70,000 US mountain summits in the viewfinder.\n\nTheodolite has been shown in Apple Keynotes, featured on the App Store, and has been a #1 selling Navigation app in App Stores around the world. Since its introduction in 2009, Theodolite has defined augmented reality navigation. The app continually introduces new technologies, pushing the limits of iOS app development and taking advantage of new hardware capabilities.\n\nFind out why Apple named Theodolite one of the most amazing apps available and showed it being used to explore the Great Wall of China. Where will you take it on your next adventure?\n\nNote: Theodolite is an iPhone app -- see “Theodolite HD” for use on an iPad.

      "label": "A high quality Speedometer, GPS tracker and trip cost monitor for iPhones and cellular iPads. \n∙∙ When you go over a preset speed limit, the large digits change colour from green to red and the device emits a loud sound to alert you! \n∙∙ The cost monitor shows you the current cost of the journey as you drive and tells you each passengers share. \n∙∙ GPS tracker records your trips so they can be analyzed, viewed and shared at any moment.\n\n‣‣ COST MONITOR. What's the cost of my driving?\nBased on gas price for a gallon or litre, MPG (U.S. or UK) or liters per 100 km the app will tell you what the cost is as you drive. You can add an extra cost per kilometer or mile! Useful for all cost aware drivers and for splitting the cost between passengers.\n\n‣‣ GPS TRACKING. Where I've been? How long did it take to get from A to B? \nSpeedometer records your trip statistics even when GPS tracker is switched off. When you need point by point data to see on the map later or export (Google Earth and GPX), speedometer gives you the first class GPS tracker.\n\n‣‣ INFOTAINMENT. \nWhen switched on, infotainment shows trip stats or weather/wind forecast  when you wait. Way better than just showing you a 0 speed!\n\n‣‣ Easy to set speed limits and SPEED LIMIT MEMORY option\nSet speed limits with 4 or 8 fast and configurable presets. Presets only need a single tap and are the safest way to set the limits! With SPEED LIMIT MEMORY you just apply the speed limit once and the app applies it for you automatically the next time!\n\n‣‣ MODES\nUse MENU>MODES to turn the app into a Rally computer, G-Force monitor, Camera alerter or taximeter! Currently there are 12 modes available and we are constantly adding new ones.\n\n‣‣ WAYPOINTS.\nSpeedometer gives you the unique way to leave a note with location and even optional photo or audio note attached! As easy as double tap on the big speed digits! You'll find more in a documentation section (star button).\n\n‣‣ RED LIGHT & SPEED CAMERAS\nImport camera data into speedometer in Garmin or iGO csv formats from poi-factory.com, scdb.info or poi-plaza and let speedo alert you on a camera approach and set speed limit automatically before you pass the speed camera!\n\n‣‣ SUNSET/SUNRISE\nWith the sunset and sunrise information that our speedometer provides, you'll be able to avoid driving in the dusk.\n\n‣‣ BARO VSI. Barometric Vertical Speed Indicator (VSI, IVSI) in both scale and graph forms.\n\n‣‣ VOICE COACH. When enabled and configured, voice coach will be telling you active track distance and duration as well as current speed and altitude.\n\n‣‣ MAPS. Google's native, Apple map, Blank map and Offline maps.\n\n‣‣ Siri shortcuts: New Track, Stop Track, Speed limits.\n\n+ UNIVERSAL APP. Speedometer for iPhone and cellular iPads. All in retina graphics.\n\n+ 000-999 SPEED AND LIMIT RANGE. MPH, KM/H AND KNOTS. Maximum/TOP, average speed, distance traveled.\n\n+ BACKGROUND MODE! Speedometer will work in background if told so and will still warn you with audio alert when exceed a preset speed limit. You can use other apps while speedometer does its job in the background!\n\n+ PRIVACY. Speedometer never shares your location data with 3rd parties or ad agencies. Location data is used solely for tracking your speed and recording the GPS tracks and never leave the app unless you decide to share by means of a track export. It always let you know when background mode is on and never runs in background unless it is explicitly told to do so.\n\n! You can use this app on your iPhone as well as on any cellular iPad. **App will not work properly on iPods and wifi only iPads as they don't have GPS (external GPS module is required). \n! Please note that as with all GPS apps, continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nDrive safely, keep the log and notes and avoid paying those speeding fines! Our speedometer is the ideal companion no matter what journey you are going on!"

      "label": "“Awesome!!! The best speed app on iphone” 5 Stars by kurtonic\n\nSpeed Box is a Speedometer and GPS app for both your iPhone and iPad. It displays your current speed, distance, direction and altitude along with your top speed and average speed. The app also keeps a record of the speed and altitude for the last few hours.\n\n\nMAIN FEATURES\n========================\n\n* MPH, KM/H and KNOTS\n* Show decimal speed (e.g. \"45.7 mph\")\n* One app for both the iPhone and iPad\n* \"Speak speed\" - Tap screen to have the speed spoken to you\n* 11 Analog and digital speedometers\n* Map view\n* Maximum and average speed\n* Altitude \n* Digital compass \n* HUD display to see speed in windshield \n* Odometer to measure distance traveled \n* Chart of the traveled speed and altitude \n* Warning signal when driving too fast \n* Export last 3 hours of data \n* Change maximum displayed speed on speedometer \n* Swipe finger over chart to display historic data \n* Display GPS accuracy by tapping the indicator in the top left corner \n\n\nUSER REVIEWS\n========================\n\n5 Stars by Darekakuta \n\"Just what I needed. My '58 chev's speedo doesn't work. This did the trick.\" \n\n5 Stars by Rawd \n\"Great My 79 Firebird speedo only goes to 140 kmh. ;). This worked perfectly.\" \n\n5 Stars \n\"Within 1 mile per hour +/- Great Job!\" \n\nSpeedBox was one of the very early Speedometer Apps for the iPhone. Take advantage of my experience and the refined algorithms that can get a much greater accuracy from the iPhone then a lot of other apps. I regularly update my application to make it even more accurate and usable. \n\nUsers have already used our application to verify the accuracy of their car's speedometer or they tried measuring the speed they achieved while skiing. Can you come up with more ideas? How about measuring the speed of the airplane you travel with? \n\nUSAGE NOTES\n========================\nThe \"GPS strength\" indicator in the top left corner should display a green dot. You can tap this indicator to display the current GPS accuracy.\n\nPlease allow the application up to a minute to find enough satellites to work correctly. \n\nIf you get a message to enable GSP, please go to ”Settings > General > Location Services“ on your iPhone and check if the little switch is set to \"On\" for Speed Box as well as for \"Location Services\" in general. \n\nATTENTION iPod touch users! Unfortunately this app doesn't work very well on the iPod touch and the iPad WiFI (without 3G) since these devices are missing a GPS!\n\n\nFEEDBACK\n========================\nIf you've got any wishes or suggestions for new features, please let me know with the contact form on this application's website (see link below).\n\nI am already working on the next update!"

The timer counts either up or down, and will display an alert when reaching zero.\r\n\r\n27 AVIATION FUNCTIONS\r\n \r\n-Pressure & Density Altitude\r\n-Planned True Airspeed\r\n-Heading and Groundspeed\r\n-Compass Heading\r\n-Leg Time\r\n-Fuel Required\r\n-Crosswind, Headwind and Tailwind\r\n-Cloud Base and Freezing Level\r\n-Actual True Airspeed\r\n-Actual True Altitude\r\n-Wind Speed and Direction\r\n-Groundspeed\r\n-Planned Mach Number\r\n-Required True Airspeed\r\n-Required Calibrated Airspeed\r\n-Distance Flown\r\n-Endurance\r\n-Fuel per Hour\r\n-Actual Mach Number\r\n-Percent Mean Aerodynamic Chord (MAC)\r\n-Hydroplane Speed\r\n-Required Rate of Climb\r\n-Specific Range\r\n-Pivotal Altitude\r\n-Top of Descent\r\n-Required Rate of Descent\r\n-Glide Distance\r\n\r\n22 AVIATION CONVERSIONS\r\n \r\n-Celsius :: Fahrenheit\r\n-Nautical Miles :: Statute Miles\r\n-Nautical Miles :: Kilometers\r\n-Feet :: Meters\r\n-Pounds :: Kilograms\r\n-Avgas Gallons :: Pounds\r\n-Jet A Gallons :: Pounds\r\n-Gallons :: Liters\r\n-Hours/Minutes/Seconds :: Hours\r\n-Climb FT/NM :: Climb Percent\r\n-Climb FT/NM :: Climb Degrees\r\n\r\nCALCULATOR\r\n \r\n-Perform basic math without having to exit the application\r\n\r\nCLOCK/TIMER\r\n \r\n-Simultaneous tracking of Zulu, Home and Local time zones\r\n-Advanced timer counts up or down and operates independently so you can perform other calculations while the timer is running\r\n-Upon reaching zero in the countdown mode, a message will display no matter what app is active  – a useful feature for missed approaches, switching fuel tanks, etc."

Many other uses for engine tuning, racing, sports, etc.\n\n* Seamlessly integrates weather data, GPS and your phone's onboard barometer to quickly and accurately calculate your density altitude, altimeter setting, relative air density, and more.\n\n* Takes humidity into account in all calculations, making it more accurate than the typical dry bulb approximation formula used by AWOS/ASOS, etc.\n\n* Works anywhere. Great without cellular connection as well, which makes it all the more useful in the backcountry and far away from ASOS/AWOS stations.\n\n* Location Search: Find atmospheric data (Density Altitude, etc.) at any point on Earth, from anywhere!\n\nData Sensed and Calculated (all calculated with humidity):\n\n* Density Altitude \n* GPS Altitude\n* Temperature\n* Altimeter Setting\n* Absolute Pressure\n* Dew Point\n* Relative Humidity\n* Specific Humidity (grains/pound)\n* Air Density\n* Relative Air Density (RAD)\n* Dyno Correction\n\nThe quickest way to get your Density Altitude! On the iPhone 6/6+ and newer iPads, it will use the built-in barometer and GPS. If you're in cell range, you don't need to supply any data. If you're out of cell range, all you need to supply is the outside air temperature. Designed not to need an internet connection, so it will work anytime and anywhere you need it.\n\nGreat tool for pilots, drag racers, engine tuners, golfers, or anyone who needs to conveniently find their Density Altitude, Altimeter Setting, Relative Aid Density (RAD), Specific Humidity or Absolute Pressure.\n\nNo ads or in-app purchases.\n\nWe love feedback!

For example, an E6B can be used to calculate heading and groundspeed after taking into account forecast winds. An E6B is also used to calculate data used for performance planning such as density altitude.

It looks just like the real thing because photos of the real thing were used to create the graphics.  \n\nPitch and roll angles are represented both with the analog instrument as well a digital display.   The instrument can be zeroed and the pitch reference \"wings\" can be adjusted, just like the real instrument.\n\nOf course, the iPhone doesn't have the same type of Gyro as an aircraft, so the instrument function is simulated using the iPhones built in accelerometer, \n\nThis program has been tested on an iPhone 3g, 3Gs, 4 and iPod touch running firmware version 4.0 on up"

      "label": "Pro Compass replicates the look and feel of classic pocket compass hardware in use since the 1800s, adding modern features and technologies.  The app uses advanced OpenGL graphics (normally reserved for games) to render 3D floating compass hardware for realistic operation.\n\nPro Compass offers nine different compass modes with direct read, traditional, and rosette styles capable of displaying degrees, quads, or mils (the direct read mode shows a North-South needle and reversed East-West convention).  In all display modes, Pro Compass shows both magnetic and true direction simultaneously, with a rotating outer true ring that is automatically adjusted for local magnetic declination.  Sun and Moon position are marked on the compass rings and continually updated.\n\nPro Compass displays location and altitude, with decimal, degree-minute-second, UTM, and MGRS position formats.  An optional \"Datum Pack\" adds over 230 geodetic datums covering regions and countries on all continents around the world.  The app also contains a built in two-axis inclinometer that drives two independent bubble levels and a bullseye level.  The inclinometer has angle readout dials for each axis, making it useful for many different types of measurements including slopes, pitches, sight lines, and geological angles like dip and strike. \n\nAfter using Pro Compass, you'll see why it's the best and most realistic compass available on the App Store!  Also be sure to check out the new Pro Compass for Watch, available for all Apple Watch models running watchOS 6 or later.\n\n***** IMPORTANT ACCURACY NOTE *****\n\nPro Compass reports accuracy directly from the magnetometer sensor in your device.  This accuracy is determined by the hardware, not the application itself.\n\nTo improve results, operate Pro Compass away from any electronics or other sources of electro-magnetic interference, including car dashboards, aircraft cockpits, metal structures, and other devices.  \n\nPlease contact the developer via the support link if you need additional information about accuracy or operation of Pro Compass."

      "label": "Pro Altimeter uses the high-fidelity barometric pressure sensor in iOS devices to measure and compute altitude.\n\nPro Altimeter has a dead simple interface.  Barometric altitude and GPS altitude are displayed in large easy to read numbers, showing units of both feet and meters, and giving realtime accuracy estimates from the hardware.  At bottom are calibration and display mode buttons. The display offers a highly-readable daytime mode with black digits on an LCD-green background, and a reversed night mode that is easy on the eyes in dark conditions. That's it!\n\nProper calibration is necessary to measure altitude from barometric pressure (this is why a pilot \"dials in\" the cockpit altimeter before taking off). Pro Altimeter offers four different methods for calibration -- choose the easiest and most convenient:\n\n1. Use GPS altitude.  This method correlates the measured local barometric pressure with the altitude measured by GPS. This method can be used when your device has a clear line of sight to the sky and a reliable GPS fix with good accuracy.\n\n2. Manually enter altitude.  This method correlates the measured local barometric pressure with known altitude from landmarks, elevation benchmarks, trail markers, topo maps, land surveys, etc.  Altitude can be entered in feet or meters.\n\n3. Manually enter pressure.  If you have a weather station, weather report, or METAR report with equivalent sea level pressure for a nearby location, this can be used to correlate local barometric pressure to altitude.  Pressure can be entered with units of inches Hg, kPa, or mb. \n\n4. Check local airports.  With the tap of a button, Pro Altimeter will locate the five closest airports within 100 miles (160km) of your present location anywhere in the world, and pull in METAR data.  From that list of five, pick the airport of your choice and Pro Altimeter will import pressure data for calibration.\n\nOnce calibrated, Pro Altimeter keeps track of the time since its last calibration.  Because weather and local barometric pressure change over time, the app will warn you when 6 hours have elapsed since the last calibration by flashing the \"CALIBRATE\" button.  You should calibrate as frequently as practical -- for example, on a hike, calibrate whenever you pass a trail marker or elevation benchmark.  But at a minimum, calibrate at least every 6 hours or whenever weather changes in your area.\n\nPro Altimeter is intended for iOS devices with a built-in barometric pressure sensor (iPhone 6 and later, iPad Air 2 and later, iPad mini 4 and later, and iPad Pro).  On older devices without a barometric pressure sensor, only GPS altitude and accuracy will be displayed.  \n\nIf you have an Apple Watch, check out the new Pro Altimeter for Watch and get all this same functionality on your wrist!"

It is a great program that has been very useful to us. I think we have 60 pilots using iPhones and iNavX and your app links in so well.\"\n\n\"I am a ships Pilot in BC and use Aye Tides a lot and it has become invaluable.”\n\nYou can see the day’s events in tabular form, or you can rotate the phone for an interactive graph that shows you the tide’s value at any point during the day. You can find a station on a map, by name, or based on your current location.\n\nAyeTides is updated regularly and stations are added whenever we find new data. We encourage our customers to contact us if you hare having any issues with the program so that we can help you. \n\nThis app is designed to run on your iPhone or iPod Touch. While it will run on your iPad, it does not offer the additional features available with AyeTides XL, which was designed specifically for the iPad. If you have multiple devices, you may want to consider our bundle. You get both apps at a discount!\n\nThis is the only place to install AyeTides. Other websites may look like they have AyeTides, but they do not. We only support iOS, any other version of AyeTides is not ours."

Following these cycles can help you get a stronger connection with nature around you and become conscious of your essence.\n\nThis app provides a simple way to sync along those cycles, to raise our frequency and give us a new lens to view both our day-to-day and planetary events.\n\n- Did you ever realize that our (Gregorian) calendar is not a harmonic calendar? \n- Did you know that the moon has 13 (not 12!) orbits around the earth in 1 year? \n- Why do we live with this irregular calendar?\n- Are you interested in Astrology?\n\n-> All this, and more, is explained carefully in this app. (over 15.000 words on 37 pages) Please note that these text are in English language only.\n\nIn the New Time, synchronicity is the norm.\n\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// \n5 star rating across the world! \n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// \n\"Entertaining as well as enlightening\" \n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// \n\nMORE INFO: \nwww.1320sync.com \n\n\nFor the beginner this app is a learning tool because it contains an extensive explanation about Tones and Seals and the synchronizing order of the Mayan Astrology. You may think it's difficult at first but soon you will feel how it all connects. \n\n\"This app is great, and allows easy manipulation of dates. I spent years in books doing in hours what I can now do in seconds.\"\n\nFor the ones who are already familiar with the Mayan Calendar this app is a handy tool to navigate the cycles, and calculate the Combined Kin for any given combination. Furthermore this app can be of great assistance to teach other people about the 13:20 cycles and is used in teachings around the world.\n\n\n=== FEATURES ===\n\n+ Kin Calendar\nThis is your main Mayan Dreamspell Calendar Dashboard with all the details you need to stay in sync. Shows the Kin of today by default, and you can calculate the Kin for any other date.\n\n+ Personal Notes\nOn this new page you can keep your personal notes for the 2 main cycles of time: the Tzolkin cycle of 260 days and the 13 Moon cycle of 365 days. And with the powerful text search function you quickly find your notes.\n\n+ Kin Picker\nSelect any combination of the 13 Tones and 20 Seals. Top section can scroll to 4 pages with information.\n\n+ Combined Kin Calculator \nCalculate the Combined Kin of any combination of Kin. You can add as many Kin as you like to calculate the Combined Kin for a group of people. \n\n+ Tzolkin with indication of the GAP day's and Wavespell and more. Tap and hold to select a Kin number directly.\n\n+ Contact Import \nAll contacts in your Contacts App will be automatically imported and assigned to the correct Kin. See all your contacts with their Mayan Reading and how you relate to them. \n\n+ 13 Moon Calendar \nFull integration of 13 Moon Calendar. (doubles as a birthday calendar!) \n\n+ 13:20 Information \nLots of information about the theory behind synchronization to help you navigate the Mayan Dreamspell Calendar. The texts provide a clear explanation of the Cycles of Time. (More than 15.000 words on 37 pages) Please note that these text are in English language only.\n\n+ Sharing\nOn all the 3 main tabs you can share the current selected Galactic Signature using your favorite app. \n\n\n# Based on the work of José Argüelles.\n# This app was made with permission of and in cooperation with the Foundation for the Law of Time - www.lawoftime.org, \n# Ariel Spilsbury."

      "label": "Keyhole markup language (KML) is a standard format used by many other mapping and navigation tools to represent geographical information. KML Map lets you create, display, and store KML map data and attached media content (often called metadata) on the iPhone/iPod Touch. Use KML Map to view photographs on maps from the location and direction they were taken, to create your own custom maps containing point, line, and polygonal data, to display topographic maps and ground overlays on top of map layers, to visualize scientific data and metadata for a variety of applications, and much more.\n\nHere are some of the features of KML Map:\n\n•Display KML point, line, and polygonal features, ground and photo overlays.\n•Standard north up or rotating map that points in your look direction.\n•Display KML content from Safari or embedded in email. Just click and see the data in KML Map.\n•Add new map features. \n•Assign address information to new objects using reverse geocoding. \n•Elevation data is downloaded from global terrain data server (not GPS) for consistency.\n•Display ground overlays (e.g., your own maps and images) over base maps/images \n•Photo overlays are rendered on a map from the location and direction they were taken.\n•Supports multiple, variable-transparency map layers\n•Read compressed KMZ files\n•Transfer files between KML Map and your computer using iTunes File Sharing\n•Download KML and KMZ content from network URLs\n•Supports standard and custom pushpins/placemark icons\n•Shows/hides names on map\n•Quickly find an object of interest in the current map layer by name\n•Display full HTML content contained in CDATA tag (text, pictures, sound files, or movies)\n\nImportant Notice\n\nKML Map understands a subset of the KML language, specifically points, line strings, and polygons (without holes). It can display ground overlays (LatLonBox format only) and photo overlays. HTML contained within CDATA tags (including pictures, sound files, and video) are rendered in a web view window. Files containing unsupported tags will not load. File sizes should be limited to 5-7 Mbytes. If the file is too large KML Map will quit. The size of files that can be emailed is limited by the operating system. KML Map also reads compressed KML or KMZ files. However, depending on the internal structure and contents of the file, KML Map may only be able to display one KMZ file at a time.\n\nN.B. Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

      "label": "BlindSquare is pioneering accessible navigation both indoors and outdoors. Know where you are, know where you're going, travel with confidence.\n\nBlindSquare is a new solution that combines the latest technology to help the blind with their daily lives. It has been developed in collaboration with blind people and carefully field tested. You need either an iPhone or an iPad to get started. It also supports some additional accessories to enhance the experience. \n\nHow does it work? \n\nBlindSquare uses GPS and the compass to locate you. It then gathers information about the surrounding environment from FourSquare. BlindSquare has some unique algorithms to decide what information is the most relevant and then speaks it to you with high quality speech synthesis. \n“What's the most popular café within 200 meters radius? Where is the post office or the library?” \n\nYou can control BlindSquare also through voice commands. The Voice Command feature is a premium service requiring purchase of credits for continuous use.  Voice Command Credits are available as an in-app purchase on the App Store.\n\nUsing BlindSquare as a GPS solution:\n\nWhen you start the app, it will start telling you the interesting places and street crossings around you. By changing the radius, you can limit the area you are interested in. You can also search by search term or by category. You can select an interesting place from the search results and perform the following tasks:\n\n1) Get contact info (address, phone number) \n2) Open twitter feed or restaurant menu (if provided)\n3) Make a phone call\n4) Start tracking the place (BlindSquare will assist you by repeating the distance and the clock face direction)\n5) Start your favourite navigator for turn-by-turn instructions (TomTom, Navigon or Apple Maps)\n\nBlindSquare is aware of when you travel by car, bus or train and starts to report interesting places in front of you (for example, the next stops) and street crossings when you are passing them.\n\nYou can also save your own private places to iCloud so they will be found with your every device.\n\nUsing BlindSquare as a Foursquare client:\n\nIf you like to play Foursquare, you can do the following with BlindSquare:\n \n1) Get a list of nearby FourSquare venues\n2) When you are in a place, you can check in by shaking your device\n3) Do a check in with commenting and twitter/facebook sharing\n4) Correct the location of the place\n\nBlindSquare supports the following languages: English, Arabic, Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean (South Korea), Norwegian, Polish, Portugues, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish.\n\nVoiceOver usage is supported but it also includes higher quality additional speech synthesis by Acapela Text-To-Speech from Acapela Group.\n \nInstructions in English: https://www.blindsquare.com/user-guide/ and https://www.blindsquare.com/faq/\n\nPlease note: This app retrieves data in real time from Foursquare and Open Street Map. Use of a flat rate data plan is highly recommended.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nHaving only been released in May 2012, BlindSquare has already received several prizes and awards:\n\n - GSMA: Global Mobile Awards 2013, Best Mobile Health Product or Service\n - Apps4Finland 2012\n - OpenCities App Challenge 2012\n - The Finnish Information Processing Association: Best Product 2012\n\nPlease note: To use BlindSquare, your iCloud account has to be active so BlindSquare can access it to save your settings and places.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

      "label": "BACKGROUND:\n\nBuilt from the ground up in the rugged mountains of eastern Afghanistan, Tactical NAV comes from the mind of a U.S. Army Field Artillery officer who had a vision of creating a low-cost and highly accurate tactical navigation platform built specifically for military service members.\n\nTactical NAV's journey began in the notorious Pech River Valley of Kunar Province, Afghanistan. \n\nU.S. Army Capt. Jonathan J. Springer, a Fire Support Officer with the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), began developing the tactical navigation platform following the memorial services for Spc. Blair D. Thompson and Spc. Jared C. Plunk, who were killed in action on June 25, 2010.\n\nAfter pitching the idea and being turned away by the Department of Defense on multiple occasions, Captain Springer remained resolute in his mission to continue developing Tactical NAV — even to this day. His ultimate goals were (and still are) to make a difference for other Soldiers and honor the men and women who were killed and wounded in battle.\n\nHe ended up using his life savings to continue moving forward with the Tactical NAV project, all with the ultimate hope of saving military lives and helping his fellow service members accomplish their mission at home and abroad.\n\nTactical NAV officially launched on the App Store on February 14, 2011.\n\nMISSION:\n\nTactical NAV's mission is to provide military service members with a low-cost, highly accurate, and exceedingly powerful mobile tactical navigational solution.\n\nVISION:\n\nOur vision is to assist and support our nation's service members with their mobile navigational needs and further enable them to operate and win during Multi-Domain Operations (MDO).\n\nBUILT FOR ACCURACY:\n\nTactical NAV's performance is on par with the AN/PSN-13 Defense Advanced GPS Receiver (DAGR), and it has the feedback to prove it.\n\nBOTTOM LINE:\n\nPurpose-built by Soldiers and created to save military lives, Tactical NAV was the very first MGRS-focused app on the App Store. It has proven to be effective across a multitude of environments all throughout the world.\n\nTactical NAV has been successfully evaluated against other software platforms and devices such as Nett Warrior, JCR, BFT, JBC-P, and ATAK. Its accuracy is within 1-to-3 meters of these officially approved systems issued by the Department of Defense.\n\nIAPs & SUBSCRIPTIONS: \n\nTactical NAV contains in-app purchases (IAPs) and subscriptions. Currently, tactical drawing mode is available as an in-app purchase, and offline mapping is also available to users as either a monthly or yearly subscription. All revenue generated from these features goes towards further developmental coding and updates, and a portion of all proceeds are donated to charities that specifically benefit disabled veterans.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n• A military-quality precision targeting platform\n• Purpose-built for the individual Soldier\n• Offline mapping capabilities (complete usage of the TACNAV platform with no emission of a cellular signal)\n• WGS 84 standard (MGRS, UTM, BNG, and USNG coordinates)\n• Tactical drawing mode (e.g., useful for Joint Fires planning, creating overlays, route planning, and so forth)\n• Waypoint plotting functionality with military graphics (per FM 1-02.2)\n• Compass \"FastLock\" function for capturing quick azimuths\n• Snap and save photographs onto the main map for intelligence purposes and AARs\n• Location, waypoint, and photo-sharing capabilities (via email and text)\n• One-button night mode function for low-light situations \n• \"Go to Grid\" option for intelligent pinpoint planning and drawing of overlays\n• Created and tested to ensure utmost accuracy and reliability \n• iOS native code built for austere and contested environments\n• And so much more!!!\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES:\n \nThe Department of Defense does not endorse Tactical NAV, nor should it be used in life-threatening or combat situations in place of a government-issued device."

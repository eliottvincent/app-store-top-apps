Get both with a one time $.99 in-app purchase.\n\n\nThere are three main components to Last Alert:\n\n1.) Audible Notifications - Select your favorite alarm sound and choose up to 3 battery alert intervals (20%, 10%, 5% etc.,) When the alert sounds, you or your child will know it's time to put it back on the charger. (Children pick up on this idea very well, and we've included several kid-friendly alarms to choose from.) \n\n\nOptional features:\n\n2.) Email Alerts - in the event of a dying battery, the app will send out an email with last known GPS coordinates. Choose up to 3 email notifications (20%, 10%, 5% etc.,) Open the email on a computer, click the link and see the location of the device on a map. \n\n3.) Radar Tracking - configure the alert messages to be sent to an email address on a second mobile device running Last Alert. You can then use the app's built-in map to get walking directions. Or try the radar view to point you to the last known location. (Go 15ft Northeast, etc.,) \n\nLast Alert compares the distance between the two devices, and tells you where to go to start your search. We also compare elevation information to help you determine if the missing device is on another floor of your house or apartment building. A sonar-style \"ping\" increases frequency, as you get closer.**\n\n___________________\nYes, there are plenty of battery and GPS apps out there, but nothing that provides all this functionality to help you find your missing device AFTER the battery has died. Kind of like good car insurance...you will really appreciate it when you need it.***\n\n___________________\n*Last Alert will need to be launched manually. For this app to run in the background, Apple requires GPS to be on constantly, which can produce a noticeable drain on the battery.\n\n**Due to the lack of hardware (magnetometer), the radar feature is not available on iPod Touch.\n\n***The accuracy of both the map and radar features are reliant on the coordinates provided by your device. Average accuracy varies between a 5ft-30ft radius. Weak or obstructed signals, and other environmental limitations may further degrade accuracy. \n\nRegardless, we will attempt to provide you with a starting point to begin the search."

Please do not use VPN, Proxy, VLANS and Subnets.\n\n* Latency is supreme (below 1 second) when you have good wifi network conditions\n\n* No hidden subscriptions or costs\n\n* If a third party app, for example Spotify, does not mirror sound correctly, please FORCE CLOSE and restart Spotify while the mirroring session is active. Please check the Apple Support page to learn how to FORCE CLOSE an app: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201330\n\n* Black screen issues: Some third party apps prevent screen mirroring. When you try to mirror them, you will just see a black screen on your TV, for example with Netflix and Disney+. This is a restriction chosen by Netflix and others, so we cannot fix it at the moment.\n\n\nIf you like the app and our constant work on it, please give the app a positive rating on the App Store. Many thanks in advance from the development & support team.\n\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Google or any other trademark mentioned here. Chromecast is a trademark of Google LLC."

Your phone controls installation of the app to the watch, not the app.  Put your watch on a charger to speed up install time;\n4. Not all audio content can be supported.  Amazon don't allow third-party apps such as this app to play music, audio books or some daily-news content, make announcements or drop-in;\n5. You can use a Siri Shortcut to launch the app and start speaking, just by raising your wrist on Apple Watch.  See the support page on how to configure;\n6. All watch complication types are supported, including those really weird ones.  Also you can change the complication icon under Settings;\n7. The watch app can listen automatically on launch. There is an option under settings to do the same thing on the iPhone;\n8. If the weather or time are wrong, ensure you've enabled Location access in the Alexa app to the \"Voice in a Can\" device, and that you have granted Location permissions to the app on your phone;\n9. You don't have to say \"Alexa\" ... just speak your command when the app is listening;\n10. You can change the language that you speak and hear responses in, under \"Settings\" on the watch and phone.  Only languages supported by Alexa are supported. The language should be set automatically.\n\nIf you have questions or any support issues please don't hesitate to email damian@voiceinacan.com ... you should get a response within 24 hours, and often in minutes.\n\nThis app was not created or endorsed by Amazon.

There is also a cost for each unit held in storage, commonly known as holding cost, sometimes expressed as a percentage of the purchase cost of the item.\n\nUse EOQ to determine the optimal number of units to order such that you can minimize the total cost associated with the purchase, delivery and storage of the product."

In detailed mode, the text being encoded is scrolling through the decoding process. \n\nTap some morse code onto the screen and the program will translate it into some text. \nDifferent input types are handled : Novice, Straight key, Memory Paddle, Iambic Paddle (A and B), Microphone. Left and right handed modes supported. \nTest and improve your skills : are you good enough to be understood? \n\nCreate audio files containing Morse code in a dynamic way or from a given text.\nUse those files as you wish : listen to them to train your decoding skills or use them as ringtones for your phone.\n\nExclusive feature allowing to decode, in real time, the Morse code recorded from the microphone into Text (the sound must be quite clear/loud and without much noise). \nSome automatic calibration is performed, allowing adaptation to speed, tone and volume changes. \n\nThe full Morse alphabet can also be consulted and the associated Morse code can be played. \nTapped and decoded text can be edited and exported to the clipboard, the In-app email and SMS. \nA special screen allows textual conversion of morse code and text. Exchange encoded messages with your friends. \n\nWikipedia and Visual Mnemonic screens allowing to get informations and mnemonics regarding morse code.\nYou can also add your own web sites for an in-app consultation.\nAll the application is highly configurable (Frequency, WPM, tone type, color, morse characters, variables ...) \n\n!!! As seen on TV !!! (UK) in Most Haunted Live: Apparently you can use it to communicate with ghosts (no guaranty though) \n\nPremium features can also be unlocked as a single in-app purchase : \nKoch trainer screen, CWops Academy learning method, Quiz screen, Prosigns, Macros, Dictionaries : abbreviations, QSOs, mnemonics, Timing (farnsworth) and Morse alphabet/prosigns personalization, look customization ... and more.\n\nMorse-it is powered by Icom, a world leader in the amateur radio market."

      "label": "このアプリは、日々の活動計画を、年間活動計画、月間活動計画からブレークダウンして、予定を管理するノート術、BULLET JOURNAL(バレット・ジャーナル)をベースにしています。\n\n全ての活動には、Objective(目的) / Target (目標)/Strategy (戦略) / があって予定を立てます。このアプリは、Bullet JournalのKeyに加え、Objective/Target/Strategy/をセットすることから始めます。\n\n使い方は、\n1. Bullet Journalに習って、最大12項目までのご自分のKeyを設定します。　例えば、タスク、タスク完了とか。いつでも初期登録を修正できますが、Saveをタップして下さい。\n2. 次に、ご自分の活動の、Objective/Target/Strategy/を最大12項目まで設定します。　例えば、仕事上の目標　とか、個人のダイエット目標とか、、初期登録をいつでも修正できますが、Saveを忘れずに。\n3. 次に、その目標を実現するための、年間活動計画をFutureLog Viewをタップして、「+」で新規のLogを　Log画面で設定します。なお、MonthlyLogViewまたはDailyLogViewからも新規Logを作成できます。\n4. Log画面では、Keyの設定, Objective/Target/Strategy/の選択、Task, Event, Memo, Infoのタイプの選択、活動なりの予定のContentを記入します。\nMarkは、3つまで利用者が任意に設定できます。\n　また、一時的に各LogViewに表示するか、しないかを選択できます。デフォルトは、Display(表示する)でいいと思います。\nさらに、入力したLogは、最初のFutureLog,すなわち年間計画のレベルから、MonthlyLogの月間計画、さらに、DailyLog(日次計画)へマイグレート(計画、スレジュールを詳細化すること)してきます。\nマイグレートした時、　FutureLog, MonthlyLog, DailyLogのフラグY/Nを選択、さらに、年、月、日と必要に応じて入力し、Saveをします。\nDailyLogの日付設定は、Log画面上部のカレンダーの日付けをタップするか、フィールドをタップすると選択できます。\n5. 各Logは、一件ごとに管理され、それらをFutureLogView, MonthlyLogView, DailyLogViewと　AllLogViewで閲覧できるようになっています。\n6. Logは、修正するたびにSaveをタップしてデータ保存をして下さい。\n7. すでにSaveしたLogは、FutureLog, MonthlyLog, DailyLog, AllLogのいずれの画面からも、セルをタップするとLog画面に移動し、修正ができます。\n8. Logを削除したい場合は、LogViewの画面の対象セルをスワイプするとDeleteが表示され、タッブして削除します。\nまた、FutureとMonthlyとDailyLogViewの画面で、並べ替えも可能としました。\n\nThis app is based on the BULLET JOURNAL (Bullet Journal), a daily activity plan that breaks down from an annual activity plan and a monthly activity plan and manages the schedule.\n\nEvery activity has an Objective / Target / Strategy / to schedule. This app starts by setting Objective / Target / Strategy / in addition to the Bullet Journal Key.\n\nUsage is\n1. Learn about Bullet Journal and set up your own keys for up to 12 items. For example, tasks and task completion. You can modify the initial registration at any time, but tap Save.\n2. Next, set up to 12 items of Objective / Target / Strategy / for your activity. For example, you can always modify your initial goals, such as work goals or personal diet goals, but don't forget to save.\n3. Next, tap FutureLog View on the annual activity plan to achieve that goal, and set a new log on the Log screen with “+”. You can also create a new log from MonthlyLogView or DailyLogView.\n4. On the Log screen, enter Key settings, Objective / Target / Strategy / selection, Task, Event, Memo, Info type selection, and the content of the activity schedule.\nUp to three Marks can be set by the user.\n Also, you can select whether or not to temporarily display each LogView. The default should be Display.\nIn addition, the entered log is migrated from the first FutureLog, that is, the level of the annual plan, to MonthlyLog's monthly plan and then to DailyLog (detailed plan and schedule).\nWhen migrating, select the FutureLog, MonthlyLog, and DailyLog flags Y / N, and enter the year, month, and day as required, and then save.\nYou can select the date setting for DailyLog by tapping the calendar date at the top of the Log screen or tapping the field.\n5. Each Log is managed on a case-by-case basis and can be viewed with FutureLogView, MonthlyLogView, DailyLogView and AllLogView.\n6. For Log, tap Save to save data each time you modify.\n7. Logs that have already been saved can be modified by tapping a cell from any of the FutureLog, MonthlyLog, DailyLog, and AllLog screens.\n8. If you want to delete a log, swipe the target cell on the LogView screen and Delete will appear. Tap to delete it.\nIn addition, it is possible to rearrange on Future, Monthly, and DailyLogView screens."

      "label": "Calculators have changed very little since the 1970s - while phones from that era look ancient. Why should calculators cling to a 40 year old design with a wall of buttons and one row for results in the age of retina displays? We deserve something better. Tydlig brings the calculator to the next level for iPhone & iPad with innovations like freeform canvas, responsive results and linked numbers. \n\nTydlig is perfect for calculating everyday things like tips and discounts, showing the entire history and allowing you to change any number with instant updates. For deeper calculations real-time graphing is an excellent way to explore and visualize things like bank interest rates and trigonometric functions.\n\nFeatures: \n\n* Responsive results: Edit any number on the canvas and see all results update automatically. Let your calculator work for you, not the other way around. \n\n* Linked numbers: With a result selected, press any operation to create a linked number below. Responsive results will cascade down these links. \n\n* All history is stored on an infinite scrolling canvas. Drag numbers around and reuse them as you wish.\n\n* Annotate any number with an attached text label, like a freestyle spreadsheet.\n\n* Real-time graphing: Link numbers to a graph and any change to the expression will instantly update the graph. Perfect when trying to explore how functions work and behave.\n\n* Use the Slider to tweak any number and see results and graphs update in real-time. Combined with the graph it is an excellent way to visualize and teach math. Tap the slider to toggle between discrete and continuous modes.\n\n* Share the entire canvas by printing, or exporting as a high quality PDF. You can also copy calculations as text, or save the visible area as an image which can be used in other applications like Pages or Word.\n\n* Undo support.\n\n* Supports external Bluetooth keyboards for really quick digit and basic operations entry (+, -, *, /).\n\n* Tydlig works completely offline, no need to be connected to the internet. \n\n* Lots of power under the hood with a lightning fast calculation engine, over 20 mathematical functions  and scientific notation formatting options."

Length, distance, area of any surface… Measure everything with this virtual ruler and tape measure thanks to augmented reality. \n\nMeasuring a length is now easier than with a laser meter or any other measure tool. You draw your measurement lines in 3D thanks to the camera directly on the video of your phone or tablet. You export your plans in PDF, PNG or DXF. CamToPlan is the AR measuring app that brings your measures from cam…to…plan !\n\nFor personal or professional use, always measure like a pro. Thanks to Virtual Reality (VR), you can measure floors, dimensions of walls, windows, doors or a whole home in a few seconds. No more tape measure or ruler needed!\n\nThis app has infinite applications for everybody:\n- Personal use: the length measure app for the handyman who loves DIY !\n- Real estate professionals (real estate agent, interior design decorator or designer, architect, topographer, energy adviser...): this app will help you make a floorplan of a house, apartment, a specific room of a flat.\n- Construction workers can use it to quickly measure jobs : concreter, tile layer, carpet fitter, painter, drywall guy, plasterer, builder, carpenter, electrician, plumber, slater... \n- For gardener, landscaper, swimming pool builders and maintenance, digger, earth-moving, navvy: this app also works outside\n- Cost estimation professionals: this length measure app can make pricing estimates, it will be a great assistant for quantity surveyor, price studies technician, economist…\n- Building industry: foreman, site manager or engineer can drop their tape measure and ruler to perform a quick measurement check\n\nHow does this measuring app work?\nIt relies on ARKit by Apple. Machine learning algorithms combine the device sensors data (accelerometer, gyroscope…) with odometry which analyses in real time the video of the camera and relies on visual details of images, in order to scan the environment and find the position and rotation angle of the device.\n\nPlease note: \n- you can measure in metric (meters, centimeters) or imperial units (feet, inches)\n- the app measures distances horizontally (= on the ground) and vertically!\n- no need to remove the furniture from the room for measurements. The application determines the intersection between the floor and the target, even if it is hidden.\n- The application may have difficulty with some types of tiles.\n- The accuracy is not guaranteed.\n- you can move while performing measurements to get closer to your target point, for maximum precision, even if it is not visible and calculated by extrapolation."

      "label": "This professional tool called Clinometer is the most precise (all you can get with some calculations) slope measurement tool for the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad using all sides of the device plus the camera. It can be used for simple applications like aligning a frame as well as for more sophisticated fields of applications where an arbitrary slope needs to be measured exactly. Read the reviews (and write your own) for all the applications you find! Thank for all your positive feedback! Please use our support link if you have questions and suggestions, we don't read the iTunes reviews every day!\n\nWith this tool, the slope can be measured by all edges of the device and through the camera. The current features include:\n\n◆ 3 Modes (incl. auto switching): Clinometer mode (auto when holding upright), Camera mode (any direction, manual activation) and Bubble level (smoothly fading in when holding flat).\n\n◆ Relative angles: Besides measuring absolute angles, for every mode you can measure the relative angle between device positions\n\n◆ Advanced two way calibration on all sides: For every 4 sides plus the bubble mode you can calibrate in two steps, which allows you to calibrate exactly even on non-level surfaces. Each direction can be calibrated individually to achieve the optimal precision. \n\n◆ Speech synthesis: The device will speak the current reading, so you don't have to watch the display while measuring/aligning your object.\n\n◆ Five different unit modes: The device can display the slope in degrees (rounded or in tenth of degrees), percentage, rise over run (common for roof slope measurement in :12) and 1V:H (common in engineering)\n\n◆ Dial Rotation: You can smoothly rotate the background dial and thus define which side of the device represents 0° and 90° degrees. \n\n◆ Motion-sensitive Lock feature: Besides the common instant simple tap hold mechanism you can activate the motion-sensitive lock. If activated the device waits for the final lock until you hold your device steady enough for at least 2 seconds. You can set the lock sensitivity between 0.1° and 1.0° degrees. \n\n◆ Peer Mode: Use two devices to measure angles: One as a display, the other as the measurement device that can be attached to the hardware you want to align. \n\n◆ Fullscreen Mode: The full screen mode can be toggled by tapping the center of the screen and by the upper and lower arrows in the center. This prevents you from erroneous inputs while measuring.\n\n◆ Different color schemes: Press the S/C Button to instantly switch the color. The color can be selected differently for the bubble and the clinometer mode. The predefined color sets include day and night color schemes (Black on White, White on Black and Red). \n\n◆ Adjustable Auto-Lock: You can prevent the device from turning into the sleep mode. \n\nAccording to wikipedia: An inclinometer or clinometer is an instrument for measuring angles of slope (or tilt), elevation or inclination of an object with respect to gravity. It is also known as a tilt meter, tilt indicator, slope alert, slope gauge, gradient meter, gradiometer, level gauge, level meter, declinometer, and pitch & roll indicator. \n\nFor recreational use only. After the calibration it CAN (!) be very accurate especially for the main axis after calibration. The measurement is performed as well as possible (we try our best) by using the three inbuilt accelerometers. \n\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT! \n\nWe will improve the application long-term. This was the first application of this kind shortly after the opening of the App Store. Since then it is continuously updated and enriched with new features."

      "label": "Rowmote lets you seamlessly control audio, video, and presentation applications on your Mac from your iOS device.\n\nYou love the remote control which came with your Mac - so simple yet elegant, with easy control of Front Row, iTunes, Quicktime, DVD Player, Keynote, and more.\n\nOr, your Mac didn’t come with a remote control or doesn’t even have an infrared port. Buying a remote control, from Apple or a third party, would carry a significant cost!\n\nYou carry your iPhone or iPod Touch wherever you go... so why should you carry a second device just to control your computer?  Furthermore, why should you need line-of-sight to do so?\n\nEnter Rowmote!  Rowmote is like your Mac’s remote control, but over the wireless network and even better! By tapping the Apps button, you get bonus abilities, switching between controlled programs, toggling the iTunes Visualizer, and more. Rowmote will even wake sleeping Macs.\n\nFEATURES\n\n - Control your Mac over a wireless network. No line of sight necessary.\n\n - Functions just like the hardware Apple Remote Control in:\n• Adobe Lightroom\n• Airfoil Video\n• Amarra\n• Aperture\n• BBC iPlayer\n• Beamer\n• Boxee\n• Decibel\n• DVD Player\n• Ecoute\n• eyeTV 3.x\n• Firefox\n• Front Row\n• Hulu Desktop\n• iPhoto\n• iTunes\n• Keynote ‘08 & later\n• kJams Pro\n• Kodi\n• Last.fm\n• Logic\n• Microsoft Powerpoint ‘04 & later\n• mPlayer\n• Movist\n• OpenOffice Impress\n• Preview\n• PandoraBoy\n• PandoraJam\n• PandoraOne Desktop\n• Photos\n• Plex, Plex Home Theater, & Plex Media Player\n• Quicktime\n• Rdio\n• Safari\n• Skim\n• Songbird\n• Spotify\n• Squire\n• The Tube\n• VLC\n• xbmc (Xbox Media Center)\n\n- SWITCH: Access your Mac’s Dock, launching & switch between all controllable applications on the Mac, toggle the iTunes visualizer, and more. Order & display customizable.\n\n - Click-and-hold works just like on the physical remote in applications; for example, holding the right button fast-forwards, while a single click is ‘next’. This is a feature no other iPhone remote control I know of does properly!\n\n- Sleep on demand; wake the Mac automatically\n- Pause the music or video automatically when you answer a call on your iPhone\n- Proximity sensor support to automatically turn the screen off if the device is face-down\n- Secure authentication\n- Optional dark interface\n- Connect via WiFi or Bluetooth (Bluetooth requires Personal Hotspot Bluetooth tethering)\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n\n • Mac OS X 10.4.0 or later.\n • Mac: The free Rowmote Helper program must be running on the Mac to be controlled. Download at www.rowmote.com. Some features require later versions of Mac OS X.\n\nRowmote is a steal! Couple it with Apple’s free Remote app to turn your iPhone or iPod Touch into the ultimate controller for home stereo, mobile presentation, or casual video viewing.\n\nThe artwork of Rowmote was designed by Rik Schennink."

Ishraq prayer is 10 to 12 minutes after sunrise. There is a misconception where Islamic websites and people use the word \"Ishraq\" and then give timings for actual Sunrise. Praying at sunrise is forbidden and must be performed after at least 10 minutes of sunrise. iPray for this reason adds 10 minutes to sunrise and labels it correctly as \"Ishraaq\".\n\n* Prayer Alerts will ONLY alert you with an initial Takbir. The full azan (and its length) is NOT supported by the iOS alert mechanism as there is a maximum limit of 30 seconds of audio playback."

      "label": "With Group SMS you can send an SMS text message to a group of contacts. Group SMS is the perfect app to send your Christmas and New Year greetings to your loved ones and friends.\n\nThese groups can be small or very large (Bulk SMS) and send to tens, hundreds or thousands of contacts. You can also send email to groups. Group SMS is ideal when you need to send the same message to any number of contacts.\n\nGroup SMS will show you the groups that are already defined in the Contacts app of your iPhone. It also allows you to create new groups as well as modify your existing groups and contacts.\n\nUsing the built-in Templates feature, you can reuse often-used text messages or emails that you need to send to groups.\n\nYou can also add attachments to your messages, like photos or PDFs.\n\nGroup SMS will send the SMS using the built-in Messages app OR you can use the special SMS gateway of Group SMS.\n\nThe costs of the SMSs will be charged by your mobile operator or you can buy SMS from within the app itself. If a group contains 12 contacts, you will be charged 12 SMS.\n\nWhen you have a very large group (more than 50 contacts), you can choose to bypass your own mobile provider and select to use the SMS gateway of Group SMS instead. This will allow you to send your Group SMS with less cost and with more control. This feature is also ideal for marketing campaigns. You can import a large set of numbers via a .CSV file.\n\nGroup Mail is always without costs. You can also forward email attachments to groups.\n\nFEATURES\n\n√ Text message a group (SMS)\n√ Text message very large groups (Bulk SMS)\n√ Email a group and forward email attachments to groups\n√ Text message to a CSV file of mobile numbers\n√ Text message with attachments (photo, PDF)\n\n√ Create groups\n√ Delete groups\n√ Rename groups\n\n√ Add contact to group\n√ Delete contact from group\n√ Edit contact information\n\n√ Templates\n\n√ Supports your built-in contacts and groups\n√ Supports your iCloud contacts and groups\n\n√ Uses built-in Messages app ór Bulk SMS Gateway\n√ Replies are received in Messages\n\n√ Uses built-in Mail app\n√ Forward attachments of any type\n\n√ Built-in video tutorials\n\nGroup SMS requires iOS 6 or higher and is localized in English, German, French, Italian, Spanish and Dutch.\n\nVideo tutorials are available on the web site (see link below) and in the app itself.\n\nREVIEWS\n\n\"Works Perfectly\" - USA\n\n\"This app does what it says it can, and does it very well.\" - United Kingdom\n\n\"WELTKLASSE.

      "label": "Note: This is the highest level of Bullet Flight (level M, Military). Also see BulletFlt L1 and BulletFlt L2 for lower-cost alternatives.\n\nKnight's Armament BulletFlight is a military-grade ballistic computer that provides quick solutions in the field. BulletFlight does not output information in table format but rather dynamically gives you the solution you need now to make that shot. Current weather conditions including temperature, pressure, humidity, wind speed, and  wind direction can be input, as well as angles to the target as measured by the built-in accelerometer. The app then provides highly detailed solutions out to 3000 meters. Your weapon profile includes your scope MOA/mRad per click, and hence when you provide a range to the target, the app will simply show how many clicks you need to change the scope by for that range and wind speed.\n\nIncludes over 1400 projectiles including carefully-measured G7 BC database for VLD bullets. BulletFlight's G7 data is courtesy of Bryan Litz and I recommend his book: http://www.appliedballisticsllc.com/index_files/Book.htm\n\nUp to five ballistic coefficients with corresponding velocity thresholds may be used for each profile to enhance accuracy, or use a single G1, G7, or G8 value.\n\nSeveral built-in profiles for the Army's M110 and M110C semi-automatic precision rifle, the Army's new XM2010 sniper rifle, the 14.5 inch SR16 rifle, The 50 BMG M107, .308 M40A3, .308 M24, and the 6.5mm KAC PDW allow you to get started quickly. You may alter these profiles, or add new ones.\n\nThis app was in combat use by military snipers in Iraq and Afghanistan. \n\nFeatures:\nBuilt-in profiles for common military rifles, but easily add more custom profiles.\nAccurate bullet database with most major brands.\n3000 meters range (2000 using simple screen).\nFast and accurate ballistic computation using G1, G7, or G8 ballistic coefficients.\nEasy to use interface yet powerful and full featured. All relevant data on screen all at once.\nUser interface designed to minimize chance of input errors.\n\"Simple Screen\" with distance wheel, but also \"Full\" screen where any exact range may be used.\nOutput in inches, cm, MOA, Mils, and scope clicks.\nOption for Metric units. In most cases imperial and metric are visible at the same time.\nDirect input for scopes with either MOA or mRad metric input (such as Schmidt & Bender).\nCalculates 360 degree wind drift using either degree of O'Clock format input.\nWind speed may be specified in either miles-per-hour or meters-per-second.\nAdvanced atmospheric model.\nUses GPS to locate nearest weather station and then automatically gets weather data and altitude for ballistic computation.\nSight-in weather may be logged and stored for automatic normalization to standard conditions. So you may sight in at any temperature or altitude and later be accurate at any other temperature or altitude.\nBuilt-in accelerometer will detect angle for improved accuracy.\nComputes actual BCs from collected data. Some users will do this for each log of ammo before a mission.\nBuilt-in mil-dot range calculator.\nCalculates bullet twist / stability with a highly-accurate formula.\nComputes bullet spin drift.\nBuilt-in help screen."

It is great for doing quick calculations when updating wiring on boats, RVs, trucks, cars, radios, or other \"low voltage\" DC applications for both do-it-yourselfers and professionals. \n\nOthers agree!\n\n\"This app is a joy to use! ...you'll be able to get the right wire gauge to use every time. Nice.\" - Cruising World Blog (11/27/2012) \n\n\"It is a must have for your electrical toolbox.\" - i-marineapps (2/9/2013) \n\nTo find your proper wire, simply select your DC voltage, your current, and the length of your circuit with simple flicks of your finger. No keyboard input needed! WireSizer will automatically calculate the minimum wire size for different percentages of voltage drop under normal or \"engine compartment\" operating conditions using copper wire. Wire gauge recommendations include commonly available sizes in AWG, SAE and ISO/Metric.\n\nUsing properly sized wire is important. Undersized wire can lead to equipment malfunction or failure, and oversized wire will add to cost and can be harder to work with. And unlike \"online\" wire gauge calculators, WireSizer will work wherever or whenever you need it.\n\nWireSizer allows you to select voltages up to 60 VDC, current up to 500 amps, and total circuit length in feet or meters up to 600 feet (or 200 meters).\n\nResults calculated are for voltage drops between 1 and 20 percent (which you can \"flip\" through to find the one which is best for your purpose), and wire sizes between 4/0 and 18 gauge AWG and SAE, and 0.75 to 92 mm.  \n\nWireSizer will also let you select whether the wire is going to run through an engine compartment or a similarly \"hot\" environment, is sheathed, bundled, or in conduit, and select the wires insulation rating (60C, 75C, 80C, 90C, 105C, 125C, 200C) to fine tune your results.\n\nAnd finally, the voltage drop calculation results are compared with the safe current carrying capacity (or \"ampacity\") of the wire, to make sure the wire suggested is suitable.\n\nAnd for your convenience, WireSizer also includes a \"Materials List\" for you to record all of your wire selections.\n\nWireSizer gauge calculation results meet ABYC E11 specifications (standard requirement for boats, excellent guidelines for other uses) provided you have clean connections, and are using good quality wire. ABYC specifications meet or exceed NEC where applicable, and correspond to ISO/FDIS.\n\n* * * NOT FOR USE WITH AC CIRCUITS * * *\n\nIf you have any questions (or complaints!), please email us.\n\nAd free, and will cost less than the wire scraps you probably throw away at the end of the day."

It works as long as you have both WiFi & Bluetooth on and within range of other devices. All devices connect effortlessly with peer-to-peer technology or via your Local Area Network (LAN). You can even leave it running in the background!\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Please read the specifications carefully before your download - This app transmits data directly over Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, but Wi-Fi and Bluetooth technology has limits in areas like range. It does NOT work like Internet-based Walkie-Talkie apps that can function anywhere with an Internet connection.\n\nFor maximum performance, this app requires all users having the same iOS version and same app version. It usually maintains a good performance when the device is within 10 meters (33 feet) with no obstructions, such as very thick concrete walls, or interference from other electronics like a microwave. However, these ranges can still be extended via LAN if all users are connected to the same LAN over Wi-Fi access points spread across multiple locations. Alternatively, good line-of-sight in open space or device models with newer Wi-Fi and Bluetooth versions also can increase range.\n\nFeature Set & Specifications:\n- Fully Offline & Private - No connection to the Internet is made\n- Connect up to 8 devices in a group together\n- Connect via existing Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN)\n- Connect via Peer-to-Peer (Ad-hoc) Wi-Fi and Bluetooth\n- Zero-Configuration connection - Just tap \"Allow\"\n- Remembers allowed connections: No confirmation needed when reconnecting\n- 10 meters (33 feet) minimum unobstructed range with peer-to-peer connection\n- Extra range available via WLAN (e.g. workplaces with multiple Wi-Fi access points)\n- Broadcast Voice Messages with Push-to-Talk*\n- Broadcast Text Messages\n- Audio input/output picker to select your preferred audio source\n- Can continue running in the background or when locked while connected\n- No Ads, No Tracking (it functions completely off the grid after all!)\n\nIf the above features and specifications are what you're looking for, get the app today!\n\n*Push-to-Talk only available on-screen. Third-party Push-to-Talk hardware is not yet supported.\n\nIf you have any problems, do contact me at lwjdev@gmail.com. I'm happy to help!"

      "label": "In this the limited but therefore free version of Clinometer. It as all features but can not be calibrated. This professional tool called Clinometer is the most precise (all you can get with some calculations) slope measurement tool for the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad. It can be used for simple applications like aligning a frame as well as for more sophisticated fields of applications where an arbitrary slope needs to be measured exactly. Read the reviews (and write your own) for all the applications you find! Thank for all your positive feedback! Please use our support link if you have questions and suggestions, we don't read the iTunes reviews every day. \n\nWith this tool, the slope can be measured by all edges of the device in every direction. When the device is put flat on the table a bubble view will fade in. The current features include: \n\n◆ Five different unit modes: The device can display the slope in degrees (rounded or in tenth of degrees), percentage, rise over run (common for roof slope measurement in :12) and 1V:H (common in engineering) \n\n◆ Dial Rotation: You can smoothly rotate the background dial and thus define which side of the device represents 0° and 90° degrees. \n\n◆ Motion-sensitive Lock feature: Besides the common instant simple tap hold mechanism you can activate the motion-sensitive lock. If activated the device waits for the final lock until you hold your device steady enough for at least 2 seconds. You can set the lock sensitivity between 0.1° and 1.0° degrees. \n\n◆ Volume Button Lock: Use volume buttons to trigger the lock.\n\n◆ Peer Mode: Use two devices to measure angles: One as a display, the other as the measurement device that can be attached to the hardware you want to align. \n\n◆ Fullscreen Mode: The full screen mode can be toggled by tapping the center of the screen and by the upper and lower arrows in the center. This prevents you from erroneous inputs while measuring.\n\n◆ Different color schemes: Press the S/C Button to instantly switch the color. The color can be selected differently for the bubble and the clinometer mode. The predefined color sets include day and night color schemes (Black on White, White on Black and Red). \n\n◆ Adjustable Auto-Lock: You can prevent the device from turning into the sleep mode.\n\nOnly the full version has a two way calibration feature!\n\nPlease support us and buy the full version if you can. \n\nAccording to wikipedia: An inclinometer or clinometer is an instrument for measuring angles of slope (or tilt), elevation or inclination of an object with respect to gravity. It is also known as a tilt meter, tilt indicator, slope alert, slope gauge, gradient meter, gradiometer, level gauge, level meter, declinometer, and pitch & roll indicator. \n\nFor recreational use only. After the calibration it CAN (!) be very accurate especially for the main axis after calibration. The measurement is performed as well as possible (we try our best) by using the three inbuilt accelerometers. \n\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT! \n\nWe will improve the application long-term. This was the first application of this kind shortly after the opening of the App Store. Since then it is continuously updated and enriched with new features.\n\n► Check out all our products (free and paid) on www.plaincode.com"

      "label": "Measure indoor room temperature using your iPhone or iPad and headset (required).\n\nOndo® is an experimental acoustic thermometer implemented using an iPhone (or iPad) and headset. Acoustic thermometers utilise the principle that the speed of sound in air changes with temperature; by measuring the speed of sound it is possible to calculate air temperature.\n\nHow it works?\nOndo® transmits a high frequency sound from the headset earpiece. This sound is received by the microphone positioned a short, fixed distance from the earpiece. The time taken for the sound to travel between the earpiece and the microphone is very accurately measured to less than a millionth of a second. \n\nWhat you will need to build your acoustic thermometer:\n• Standard Apple headset (EarPods with lightning connector)\n• Old credit or debit card (to provide a base)\n• Four elastic bands (to hold the right earpiece and microphone in position)\n• iPhone or iPad with Ondo® installed\n\nGetting started:\n• Follow the simple instructions in the app (or on the website www.ondo.app) to build your headset thermometer\n• Calibrate to the starting temperature and your thermometer is ready to use\n• Move the phone and headset to a different temperature zone e.g. take it outside or move nearer to a heater and watch the reading change\n\nSpecification:\n• Temperature range -40 to 50 degrees Celsius\n• Accuracy +/- 1 degree (dependent upon headset fixing)\n\nPLEASE NOTE - This app will only work with a headset connected and set up according to the instructions in the app. Please do not buy this app if you do not have a suitable headset. This app will not work with AirPods."

Want to know whether or not your heavy passenger *really* has to sit in the back and how much fuel must be maintained to stay in CG?  This app will tell you at a much lower cost.\n\nThis app will be a great help to new R44 pilots that need to quickly figure out if they have to put their 250lb. friend in back and the 160lb. teenager in front to maintain CG as well as how much fuel must be maintained to stay in CG in cases where it’s out of CG at zero fuel.  It’s also a great educational tool for new pilots to quickly see how much influence a seemingly insignificant amount of weight has on CG. You’ll quickly find out why R44 pilots are most desirable in the 150 - 200lb. range. You’ll also discover why the R44 CG envelopes are beveled at the corners.\n\nThe primary data displays are Longitudinal and Lateral graphs.  You can look at the raw numbers if you want to, but it’s designed to give you CG data in graphical form. You’ll find yourself hardly ever looking at the raw number display.\n\nThis app came about when I saw what was being charged for the other R44 weight & balance apps. I just couldn’t see paying significant money for a calculator I could write in five minutes.  It turns out that while yes, I could whip something up in a short amount of time for a single heli on a single iDevice, creating a dynamically graphed app that holds multiple R44 and scales from an iPhone 4s to an iPad Pro with no loss of functionality took considerably more than five minutes.  More like a hundred hours or so. On the bright side, I think the end result offers more than competing apps at a much lower price.\n\nIt is intended to be run on iPhone 5 and larger up through an iPad Pro.  On an iPhone 4s, the graph will be compressed (good excuse to trade up).\n\nFeatures:\n\t•\tShows CG for both zero fuel and current fuel.\n\t•\tIf out of CG at zero fuel, it shows the minimum fuel that must be maintained to stay in balance.\n\t•\tLongitudinal and Lateral CG graphs.\n\t•\tHolds multiple R44 helicopters for those who fly more than one and can easily switch between them.\n\t•\tAccommodates the Astro, Mariner, Raven I, and Raven II, and the yet to be released Cadet (best guess / experimental)\n\t•\tIndividual weight entries for all seats and baggage compartments\n\t•\tAccommodates doors on & off; makes more difference than you would think.\n\t•\tShows overweight warnings for the overall helicopter and combined seat & baggage.\n\t•\tRuns on iPhone 4s through iPad Pro.\n\t•\tLight weight app: uses little space and low CPU usage."

      "label": "WHAT IS IT? \n------------------------------------------// \nA2DPblocker is an audio player that blocks the Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP) (i.e. Bluetooth Stereo Profile) from connecting on a Bluetooth enabled iOS device without completely disabling the Bluetooth hardware. This enables the iOS device to continue to perform other Bluetooth functions like default audio output from another audio app (dictation, audio books, podcasts, GPS, music streaming, etc.) to a Hands-Free Profile (HFP) enabled Bluetooth car kit, headset, etc. as well as make phone calls over Bluetooth, and wirelessly control the iPod with a paired AVRCP enabled Bluetooth accessory. \n\nA2DP was introduced in iOS 3.0 and this app simply blocks A2DP from connecting and maintains the default audio output device when it's running in the foreground (including when the screen is locked on iOS 3.1 or later devices) or background (requires iOS 4.0 or later).\n\nYou can finally disable A2DP once and for all with this app and stop manually changing the default audio output device each time your car kit, headset, or whatever A2DP enabled Bluetooth accessory you have connects to your iOS device. \n\n\nFEATURES \n------------------------------------------// \n- blocks A2DP.\n- defaults audio output from another audio app to a HFP enabled Bluetooth car kit, headset, etc.\n- maintains the default audio output device. \n- built-in iPod controls. \n- audio Playback Queue (requires iOS 4.0 or later). \n- suppresses audio notification alerts (only on pre-iOS 7.0 or earlier devices). \n\n\nHOW TO USE \n------------------------------------------// \n1.) Pair your Bluetooth enabled iOS device with your Bluetooth car kit, headset, etc.\n2.) Launch A2DPblocker and ensure “A2DP Blocker\" switch is ON.\n3.) Add a downloaded non-DRM (i.e. not copy-protected) audio track from your music library to the Playback Queue on iOS 4.0 or later and adjust the independent volume slider to guarantee A2DP is blocked.\n4.) Ensure “Remote Control\" switch is OFF.\n5.) Set Default Audio to “speaker+” / “receiver” / “speaker” to block A2DP or “headset+” to default audio output via HFP.\n6.) Play Playback Queue.\n7.) Launch and configure your other audio app or begin playing the iPod with the built-in iPod controls or an attached accessory.\n\nNow your Bluetooth enabled iOS device should block the A2DP connection from occurring or audio should now be streaming via the HFP connection as long as A2DPblocker is active. Successive launches of A2DPblocker doesn't require reconfiguration and it will not interfere with the phone call function or transport controls (AVRCP).\n\n\nNOTICE\n------------------------------------------// \nHFP enabled Bluetooth car kits, headsets, etc. that only support the phone call function may configure A2DPblocker to utilize the same connection to playback audio (see HOW TO USE). However, the audio quality of the HFP standard is designed to be low bitrate, mono, and frequency limited to voice ranges, which is why music streaming may sound a bit lacking, but streaming dictation, audio books, podcasts, GPS, etc. for example would sound normal.\n\n\nREQUIREMENTS \n------------------------------------------// \n- requires iOS 7.0 or later. \n- Bluetooth. \n- microphone or other audio input. \n- works best with the audio Playback Queue active. \n\n\nCONTACT INFO \n------------------------------------------// \nPlease contact me with your questions and/or comments. If you just love A2DPblocker then please leave a review! \n- twitter.com/gnavicks \n- dkanem.selfip.com"

With the highlighted keyboard, you can just type \"dtmnn\" to have it show in the suggestion bar.\n\nAnother example is that once I wanted to input \"anthropology\" but I forgot the spelling, all I remembered was it started with \"an\" something and ended with \"logy\", I then typed “anlg” in the Highlighted keyboard and I saw “anthropology” in the suggestion list.\n\n** Highlighted next possible keys\nAfter you type one key the keyboard will smartly highlights the possible next keys that you want to input. Also it has the suggestions that you can select from the top of the keyboard.\n\n** Latin letters supported\nYou can type the latin letters directly from the keyboard. You can also type \"£\" &  \"€\" as well.\n\n** Emoji translation\nTranslate the word that you select in the suggestion bar into Emoji characters.

It is disabled by default and you need to use the \"Keyboard Setting\" page to enable this feature.\n\n** Slide to move the input cursor\nSliding from the Space key to left/right to move the current input cursor to left or right. Sliding up to move the current cursor to the beginning of the sentence and sliding down to move the current cursor to the end of the sentence. It makes your life much easier when editing text on the iPhone/iPad.\n\n** 36 most common emojis in the same keyboard without switching UI\nLong press on the \"happy face\" emoji key and it will popup the36  most common emojis. You can then input directly from there.\n\n** Full Emoji keys supported\nIt is very convenience to input Emoji characters with this keyboard when you are using Facebook, Twitter, iMessage, Wechat, Text Message, SMS, etc. Just long press on the key that has sub-menu and more Emoji characters will pop up. The Emoji characters are well categorized and you can input the Emoji and Text together in one keyboard!\n\n** Numeric Keypad\nThis keyboard supports the traditional numeric keypad layout with big number keys. It is useful for entering long sequences of numbers quickly.  \n\n** Keyboard Settings\nLong press on the \"globe\"/\"123\" key to pop up the sub-menu. Select the \"Tool\" key to launch the setting page. You can enable/disable the Highlight Next key feature. You can also enable/disable the \"Emoji translation\" feature.\n\n** NO Full Access required\n\n** How to use\n1. After install you need to enable it in the \"Settings\" App in your iPhone/iPad.\n\nLaunch \"Settings\", click on \"General\" -> \"Keyboard\" -> \"Keyboards\" -> \"Add New Keyboard\" -> Select the \"HighlightedKeyboard\".\n\n2.

Please do not use VPN, Proxy, VLANS and Subnets.\n\n* Latency is supreme (below 1 second) when you have good wifi network conditions\n\n* No hidden subscriptions or costs\n\n* If a third party app, for example Spotify, does not mirror sound correctly, please FORCE CLOSE and restart Spotify while the mirroring session is active. Please check the Apple Support page to learn how to FORCE CLOSE an app: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201330\n\n* Black screen issues: Some third party apps prevent screen mirroring. When you try to mirror them, you will just see a black screen on your TV, for example with Netflix and Disney+. This is a restriction chosen by Netflix and others, so we cannot fix it at the moment.\n\n\nIf you like the app and our constant work on it, please give the app a positive rating on the App Store. Many thanks in advance from the development & support team.\n\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Google or any other trademark mentioned here. Chromecast is a trademark of Google LLC."

Length, distance, area of any surface… Measure everything with this virtual ruler and tape measure thanks to augmented reality. \n\nMeasuring a length is now easier than with a laser meter or any other measure tool. You draw your measurement lines in 3D thanks to the camera directly on the video of your phone or tablet. You export your plans in PDF, PNG or DXF. CamToPlan is the AR measuring app that brings your measures from cam…to…plan !\n\nFor personal or professional use, always measure like a pro. Thanks to Virtual Reality (VR), you can measure floors, dimensions of walls, windows, doors or a whole home in a few seconds. No more tape measure or ruler needed!\n\nThis app has infinite applications for everybody:\n- Personal use: the length measure app for the handyman who loves DIY !\n- Real estate professionals (real estate agent, interior design decorator or designer, architect, topographer, energy adviser...): this app will help you make a floorplan of a house, apartment, a specific room of a flat.\n- Construction workers can use it to quickly measure jobs : concreter, tile layer, carpet fitter, painter, drywall guy, plasterer, builder, carpenter, electrician, plumber, slater... \n- For gardener, landscaper, swimming pool builders and maintenance, digger, earth-moving, navvy: this app also works outside\n- Cost estimation professionals: this length measure app can make pricing estimates, it will be a great assistant for quantity surveyor, price studies technician, economist…\n- Building industry: foreman, site manager or engineer can drop their tape measure and ruler to perform a quick measurement check\n\nHow does this measuring app work?\nIt relies on ARKit by Apple. Machine learning algorithms combine the device sensors data (accelerometer, gyroscope…) with odometry which analyses in real time the video of the camera and relies on visual details of images, in order to scan the environment and find the position and rotation angle of the device.\n\nPlease note: \n- you can measure in metric (meters, centimeters) or imperial units (feet, inches)\n- the app measures distances horizontally (= on the ground) and vertically!\n- no need to remove the furniture from the room for measurements. The application determines the intersection between the floor and the target, even if it is hidden.\n- The application may have difficulty with some types of tiles.\n- The accuracy is not guaranteed.\n- you can move while performing measurements to get closer to your target point, for maximum precision, even if it is not visible and calculated by extrapolation."

      "label": "This professional tool called Clinometer is the most precise (all you can get with some calculations) slope measurement tool for the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad using all sides of the device plus the camera. It can be used for simple applications like aligning a frame as well as for more sophisticated fields of applications where an arbitrary slope needs to be measured exactly. Read the reviews (and write your own) for all the applications you find! Thank for all your positive feedback! Please use our support link if you have questions and suggestions, we don't read the iTunes reviews every day!\n\nWith this tool, the slope can be measured by all edges of the device and through the camera. The current features include:\n\n◆ 3 Modes (incl. auto switching): Clinometer mode (auto when holding upright), Camera mode (any direction, manual activation) and Bubble level (smoothly fading in when holding flat).\n\n◆ Relative angles: Besides measuring absolute angles, for every mode you can measure the relative angle between device positions\n\n◆ Advanced two way calibration on all sides: For every 4 sides plus the bubble mode you can calibrate in two steps, which allows you to calibrate exactly even on non-level surfaces. Each direction can be calibrated individually to achieve the optimal precision. \n\n◆ Speech synthesis: The device will speak the current reading, so you don't have to watch the display while measuring/aligning your object.\n\n◆ Five different unit modes: The device can display the slope in degrees (rounded or in tenth of degrees), percentage, rise over run (common for roof slope measurement in :12) and 1V:H (common in engineering)\n\n◆ Dial Rotation: You can smoothly rotate the background dial and thus define which side of the device represents 0° and 90° degrees. \n\n◆ Motion-sensitive Lock feature: Besides the common instant simple tap hold mechanism you can activate the motion-sensitive lock. If activated the device waits for the final lock until you hold your device steady enough for at least 2 seconds. You can set the lock sensitivity between 0.1° and 1.0° degrees. \n\n◆ Peer Mode: Use two devices to measure angles: One as a display, the other as the measurement device that can be attached to the hardware you want to align. \n\n◆ Fullscreen Mode: The full screen mode can be toggled by tapping the center of the screen and by the upper and lower arrows in the center. This prevents you from erroneous inputs while measuring.\n\n◆ Different color schemes: Press the S/C Button to instantly switch the color. The color can be selected differently for the bubble and the clinometer mode. The predefined color sets include day and night color schemes (Black on White, White on Black and Red). \n\n◆ Adjustable Auto-Lock: You can prevent the device from turning into the sleep mode. \n\nAccording to wikipedia: An inclinometer or clinometer is an instrument for measuring angles of slope (or tilt), elevation or inclination of an object with respect to gravity. It is also known as a tilt meter, tilt indicator, slope alert, slope gauge, gradient meter, gradiometer, level gauge, level meter, declinometer, and pitch & roll indicator. \n\nFor recreational use only. After the calibration it CAN (!) be very accurate especially for the main axis after calibration. The measurement is performed as well as possible (we try our best) by using the three inbuilt accelerometers. \n\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT! \n\nWe will improve the application long-term. This was the first application of this kind shortly after the opening of the App Store. Since then it is continuously updated and enriched with new features."

Buying a remote control, from Apple or a third party, would carry a significant cost!\n\nYou carry your iPhone or iPod Touch wherever you go... so why should you carry a second device just to control your computer?  Furthermore, why should you need line-of-sight to do so?\n\nEnter Rowmote!  Rowmote is like your Mac’s remote control, but over the wireless network and even better! By tapping the Apps button, you get bonus abilities, switching between controlled programs, toggling the iTunes Visualizer, and more. Rowmote will even wake sleeping Macs.\n\nFEATURES\n\n - Control your Mac over a wireless network. No line of sight necessary.\n\n - Functions just like the hardware Apple Remote Control in:\n• Adobe Lightroom\n• Airfoil Video\n• Amarra\n• Aperture\n• BBC iPlayer\n• Beamer\n• Boxee\n• Decibel\n• DVD Player\n• Ecoute\n• eyeTV 3.x\n• Firefox\n• Front Row\n• Hulu Desktop\n• iPhoto\n• iTunes\n• Keynote ‘08 & later\n• kJams Pro\n• Kodi\n• Last.fm\n• Logic\n• Microsoft Powerpoint ‘04 & later\n• mPlayer\n• Movist\n• OpenOffice Impress\n• Preview\n• PandoraBoy\n• PandoraJam\n• PandoraOne Desktop\n• Photos\n• Plex, Plex Home Theater, & Plex Media Player\n• Quicktime\n• Rdio\n• Safari\n• Skim\n• Songbird\n• Spotify\n• Squire\n• The Tube\n• VLC\n• xbmc (Xbox Media Center)\n\n- SWITCH: Access your Mac’s Dock, launching & switch between all controllable applications on the Mac, toggle the iTunes visualizer, and more. Order & display customizable.\n\n - Click-and-hold works just like on the physical remote in applications; for example, holding the right button fast-forwards, while a single click is ‘next’. This is a feature no other iPhone remote control I know of does properly!\n\n- Sleep on demand; wake the Mac automatically\n- Pause the music or video automatically when you answer a call on your iPhone\n- Proximity sensor support to automatically turn the screen off if the device is face-down\n- Secure authentication\n- Optional dark interface\n- Connect via WiFi or Bluetooth (Bluetooth requires Personal Hotspot Bluetooth tethering)\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n\n • Mac OS X 10.4.0 or later.\n • Mac: The free Rowmote Helper program must be running on the Mac to be controlled. Download at www.rowmote.com. Some features require later versions of Mac OS X.\n\nRowmote is a steal! Couple it with Apple’s free Remote app to turn your iPhone or iPod Touch into the ultimate controller for home stereo, mobile presentation, or casual video viewing.\n\nThe artwork of Rowmote was designed by Rik Schennink."

Ishraq prayer is 10 to 12 minutes after sunrise. There is a misconception where Islamic websites and people use the word \"Ishraq\" and then give timings for actual Sunrise. Praying at sunrise is forbidden and must be performed after at least 10 minutes of sunrise. iPray for this reason adds 10 minutes to sunrise and labels it correctly as \"Ishraaq\".\n\n* Prayer Alerts will ONLY alert you with an initial Takbir. The full azan (and its length) is NOT supported by the iOS alert mechanism as there is a maximum limit of 30 seconds of audio playback."

You can also send email to groups.

Please do not use VPN, Proxy, VLANS and Subnets.\n\n* Latency is supreme (below 1 second) when you have good wifi network conditions\n\n* No hidden subscriptions or costs\n\n* If a third party app, for example Spotify, does not mirror sound correctly, please FORCE CLOSE and restart Spotify while the mirroring session is active. Please check the Apple Support page to learn how to FORCE CLOSE an app: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201330\n\n* Black screen issues: Some third party apps prevent screen mirroring. When you try to mirror them, you will just see a black screen on your TV, for example with Netflix and Disney+. This is a restriction chosen by Netflix and others, so we cannot fix it at the moment.\n\n\nIf you like the app and our constant work on it, please give the app a positive rating on the App Store. Many thanks in advance from the development & support team.\n\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Google or any other trademark mentioned here. Chromecast is a trademark of Google LLC."

      "label": "Create ringtones with your own customized Morse Code messages.  Don't bore people with yet another pop tune blaring from your phone.  Be different... retro-tech.  Communicate.  Or just hide really funny messages in your ringtones for \"special\" people (be they your best friends or your worse enemies).  Only other Alpha-geeks will understand.\n\nYou can email your new Morse Code ringtone file to yourself or a friend, and use iTunes on a Mac or PC to install the ringtone file to your iPhone.  Using iTunes on a Mac, simply connect your iPhone, and drag-and-drop the new ringtone file to \"On My Device\".\n\nThis app allows pasting your new Morse Code ringtone sound directly into an iOS GarageBand track, thus allowing one to create a ringtone directly on a iOS device, without having to Sync with iTunes.    Using GarageBand on iOS to install a ringtone is not a simple one-step process.  GarageBand requires a user to navigate and find several interesting looking and nearly hidden buttons in order to install a new ringtone.  \n\nOnce the new ringtone file is on your iPhone, you can use the Settings app in order to select your new custom ringtone.\n\nWith Morse Code Ringtone Maker, you can customize the text and the Morse Code/CW speed (combined up to 30 seconds), as well as the the tone frequency.  The Words-Per-Minute (WPM) speed is variable from 5 to 40 WPM.  The tone frequency is customizable from 300 to 1200 Hz.  On the customization page, you can additionally configure Farnsworth timing where the dots and dashes for each letter come even faster than the WPM of the letters.  For different timbres, select Sinewaves, Square-waves or Triangle-waves for your tone sound."

      "label": "Necrophonic is an ITC app used for spirit communication and EVP research.\n\n8 Sounds Banks:\n\nThe audio has been mastered in a way to bring out various sound properties . \nUsing Pro Tools I was able to enhance high, mid, and low range frequencies. I also applied \nother filters to create unique sound characteristics to help layer the audio and create an \nenvironment suitable for spirit communication.\n\nThe audio itself is made up of phonemes, \npartial words, reverse audio, foreign languages, and other parts of speech that can help \nspirits communicate. Besides some basic phonetic sounds such as na, no, da, do, di, ma, may, etc.\nthere are no real words of phrases contained in the banks.\n\nThese sounds banks play in a similar\nway to that of my other app \"Spiritus Ghost Box\" but instead of 4 sound banks Necrophonic has\n8 active sound banks.\n\nWhite Noise Sound Bank:\n\nThis app also has an optional 9th sound bank called \"White noise\". \nThis bank can be used alone or with the other 8 giving you a total of 9 sound banks. This \naudio is taken for the internal sounds of the famous DR60 recorder that is known as the \n\"Holy Grail\" of EVP recorders. This is not a White Noise Generator, this is a normal sound bank like the others but this one contains white noise from the DR60.\n\nAudio Effects:\n\nThis app does contain Echo and Reverb audio effects. These have been proven \nto be the best effects to apply to ITC sessions. The echo can create audio that can be \nmanipulated within the echo itself. Echo can also help in live, real time communication by \nrepeating the audio and allowing you to better hear whats coming through. Reverb can be \napplied to the audio to create a spacious sound environment that will enhance audio manipulation."

      "label": "\"Music Frequency Analyzer\" is a new sound source analysis tool for digital music content.\n\nDo you know what kind of sound characteristics your favorite music source has? This app allows you to check the sound characteristics of music sources.\n\nFor example, you can find out the bass and treble frequencies, the frequency overlap at the beginning and climax of the music, the recording condition, the background noise level, and more. It can also be used as reference information for acoustic evaluation when the same sound source is played back on audio equipment.\n\nThis app analyzes the information in the music file and displays the sound characteristics by FFT analysis and 1/3 octave band analysis in real time. It can also display quantitative analysis of their peak hold and average values.\n\nIn addition, with the fluctuation analysis, you can also see the degree of \"1/f fluctuation\", which shows the trend of frequency distribution of the sound source.\n\nFeatures: \n- Supported files: PCM, ALAC, AAC, MP3 format , Sampling frequency: 44.1kHz, 48kHz\n *Only music data synced with the Apple music app or iTunes can be used. iCloud Music Library is not available.\n- Source information display: title, file type, bit rate/quantization bit, sampling rate\n- FFT analysis: 4096 points / -110dB to +10dB\n-- Peak hold (Hold)\n-- FFT Average (Off/1s/10s/All): Off / Approx. 1s / Approx. 10s / Whole music\n-- Fluctuation analysis (1/f): 20 to 20 kHz, red line (instantaneous) / blue line (average)\n-- Channel selection display (L-ch/R-ch) [Monaural sound source is displayed on L-ch].\n- 1/3-octave band analysis: -100 dB to +10 dB\n-- Peak hold (Hold)\n-- Simultaneous 2-channel display: L-green, R-yellow  [Monaural sound source is displayed on L-channel].\n- Snapshot (Snap): Save image of analysis display\n\nHow to use:\n- Click List button to display the song list, and select the song you want to analyze.\n- Select the song you want to analyze.\n- You can use the time slider to move to an arbitrary time.\n- You can save a snapshot of the sound characteristics at the point you want to know.\n\nFluctuation Analysis: \nIn physics, \"fluctuation\" is the variation of energy from its average value over space and time. The 1/f fluctuation is said to be a pleasant natural rhythm, such as the murmuring of a stream or the lapping of waves.\nThe 1/f fluctuation has a characteristic that the Fourier-analyzed power spectrum is inversely proportional to the frequency. This app's fluctuation analysis determines the degree of fluctuation of a song by calculating the slope of the power spectrum of FFT analysis.\n- 1/f0 (0dB/Oct): White noise\n- 1/f1 (-3dB/Oct): Pink noise\n- 1/f2 (-6dB/Oct): Brownian noise\nIn general, it is said that sounds with a -3dB/Oct characteristic, such as pink noise, which attenuates gently in the high frequency range, are pleasant to listen to.\n\nRemarks:\n- Even if the audio format is playable on the iOS system, playback of all files is not guaranteed. Depending on encoding parameters and data size, playback may not be possible. (Linear PCM data can be analyzed up to about 15 minutes.) It also depends on the hardware performance of your iPhone device.\n- This app accesses to music files that exist in the music library in the iPhone. Music files must be downloaded to the iPhone. For example, if you have music files on your Mac/PC that you have ripped from CDs, etc., you can import the music files to your iPhone through device synchronization. Music files purchased from Apple Music subscriptions or the iTunes Store must be added to the library and then downloaded to the iPhone."

      "label": "This professional tool called Clinometer is the most precise (all you can get with some calculations) slope measurement tool for the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad using all sides of the device plus the camera. It can be used for simple applications like aligning a frame as well as for more sophisticated fields of applications where an arbitrary slope needs to be measured exactly. Read the reviews (and write your own) for all the applications you find! Thank for all your positive feedback! Please use our support link if you have questions and suggestions, we don't read the iTunes reviews every day!\n\nWith this tool, the slope can be measured by all edges of the device and through the camera. The current features include:\n\n◆ 3 Modes (incl. auto switching): Clinometer mode (auto when holding upright), Camera mode (any direction, manual activation) and Bubble level (smoothly fading in when holding flat).\n\n◆ Relative angles: Besides measuring absolute angles, for every mode you can measure the relative angle between device positions\n\n◆ Advanced two way calibration on all sides: For every 4 sides plus the bubble mode you can calibrate in two steps, which allows you to calibrate exactly even on non-level surfaces. Each direction can be calibrated individually to achieve the optimal precision. \n\n◆ Speech synthesis: The device will speak the current reading, so you don't have to watch the display while measuring/aligning your object.\n\n◆ Five different unit modes: The device can display the slope in degrees (rounded or in tenth of degrees), percentage, rise over run (common for roof slope measurement in :12) and 1V:H (common in engineering)\n\n◆ Dial Rotation: You can smoothly rotate the background dial and thus define which side of the device represents 0° and 90° degrees. \n\n◆ Motion-sensitive Lock feature: Besides the common instant simple tap hold mechanism you can activate the motion-sensitive lock. If activated the device waits for the final lock until you hold your device steady enough for at least 2 seconds. You can set the lock sensitivity between 0.1° and 1.0° degrees. \n\n◆ Peer Mode: Use two devices to measure angles: One as a display, the other as the measurement device that can be attached to the hardware you want to align. \n\n◆ Fullscreen Mode: The full screen mode can be toggled by tapping the center of the screen and by the upper and lower arrows in the center. This prevents you from erroneous inputs while measuring.\n\n◆ Different color schemes: Press the S/C Button to instantly switch the color. The color can be selected differently for the bubble and the clinometer mode. The predefined color sets include day and night color schemes (Black on White, White on Black and Red). \n\n◆ Adjustable Auto-Lock: You can prevent the device from turning into the sleep mode. \n\nAccording to wikipedia: An inclinometer or clinometer is an instrument for measuring angles of slope (or tilt), elevation or inclination of an object with respect to gravity. It is also known as a tilt meter, tilt indicator, slope alert, slope gauge, gradient meter, gradiometer, level gauge, level meter, declinometer, and pitch & roll indicator. \n\nFor recreational use only. After the calibration it CAN (!) be very accurate especially for the main axis after calibration. The measurement is performed as well as possible (we try our best) by using the three inbuilt accelerometers. \n\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT! \n\nWe will improve the application long-term. This was the first application of this kind shortly after the opening of the App Store. Since then it is continuously updated and enriched with new features."

      "label": "The HotPaw Morse Code Decoder translates Morse Code sound into text.  Just use the microphone or headset input on your iPhone or iPad for the audio signal input, and watch decoded text appear.\n\nThe Morse Code Decoder includes both an automatic decoding mode, plus manual controls to allow the decoding of weaker signals in noise and QRM.  Manually adjustable parameters include the frequency of the audio filter, the WPM dot/dash speed used for detecting characters, the threshold level of background noise, and whether Farnsworth timing is to be used for detecting spaces between individual characters.\n\nThe Morse Code Decoder includes a built-in spectrogram to help determine the audio frequency of the Morse Code tones.  Use the optional narrow-band DSP audio filter to help filter out background noise.  The audio filter works for tone frequencies from 300 to 2400 Hz.  Please do not try to decode tones outside this range.\n\nThe Morse code WPM (words per minute) detection speed is automatically adaptive from about 8 to 40 WPM, and can be locked to the current estimated WPM dot speed.  You can also manually set the WPM code speed if the automatic speed detection guesses incorrectly.  A QRQ High Speed WPM mode setting allows decoding much higher WPM speeds in the range of 30 to 80 WPM.\n\nPlease aim your iPhone microphone at the Morse Code sound source so that the iPhone's noise cancelling microphone doesn't cancel it out.  You can see if sound is getting to the iPhone by seeing a peak in the spectrum display.  Please use the manual settings if automatic decoding does not adjust to the frequency, WPM. or background noise threshold level properly.  Decoding will not work if the audio filter or WPM are set incorrectly, or there is a lot of background noise or room echoes above the threshold setting.  Please see the help file on the HotPaw website for hints as to how to solve decoding issues."

      "label": "Measure anything with CamToPlan! Horizontally and vertically! Length, distance, area of any surface… Measure everything with this virtual ruler and tape measure thanks to augmented reality. \n\nMeasuring a length is now easier than with a laser meter or any other measure tool. You draw your measurement lines in 3D thanks to the camera directly on the video of your phone or tablet. You export your plans in PDF, PNG or DXF. CamToPlan is the AR measuring app that brings your measures from cam…to…plan !\n\nFor personal or professional use, always measure like a pro. Thanks to Virtual Reality (VR), you can measure floors, dimensions of walls, windows, doors or a whole home in a few seconds. No more tape measure or ruler needed!\n\nThis app has infinite applications for everybody:\n- Personal use: the length measure app for the handyman who loves DIY !\n- Real estate professionals (real estate agent, interior design decorator or designer, architect, topographer, energy adviser...): this app will help you make a floorplan of a house, apartment, a specific room of a flat.\n- Construction workers can use it to quickly measure jobs : concreter, tile layer, carpet fitter, painter, drywall guy, plasterer, builder, carpenter, electrician, plumber, slater... \n- For gardener, landscaper, swimming pool builders and maintenance, digger, earth-moving, navvy: this app also works outside\n- Cost estimation professionals: this length measure app can make pricing estimates, it will be a great assistant for quantity surveyor, price studies technician, economist…\n- Building industry: foreman, site manager or engineer can drop their tape measure and ruler to perform a quick measurement check\n\nHow does this measuring app work?\nIt relies on ARKit by Apple. Machine learning algorithms combine the device sensors data (accelerometer, gyroscope…) with odometry which analyses in real time the video of the camera and relies on visual details of images, in order to scan the environment and find the position and rotation angle of the device.\n\nPlease note: \n- you can measure in metric (meters, centimeters) or imperial units (feet, inches)\n- the app measures distances horizontally (= on the ground) and vertically!\n- no need to remove the furniture from the room for measurements. The application determines the intersection between the floor and the target, even if it is hidden.\n- The application may have difficulty with some types of tiles.\n- The accuracy is not guaranteed.\n- you can move while performing measurements to get closer to your target point, for maximum precision, even if it is not visible and calculated by extrapolation."

It can also repeat the sound alarm (up to 3 times) at the given interval if it was missed/snoozed.\n\n* COLOR YOUR TIME\nYou can easily change the timer color to fit your personal lifestyle. There are 5 color themes: turquoise, red, green, amber and pink.

      "label": "Rowmote lets you seamlessly control audio, video, and presentation applications on your Mac from your iOS device.\n\nYou love the remote control which came with your Mac - so simple yet elegant, with easy control of Front Row, iTunes, Quicktime, DVD Player, Keynote, and more.\n\nOr, your Mac didn’t come with a remote control or doesn’t even have an infrared port. Buying a remote control, from Apple or a third party, would carry a significant cost!\n\nYou carry your iPhone or iPod Touch wherever you go... so why should you carry a second device just to control your computer?  Furthermore, why should you need line-of-sight to do so?\n\nEnter Rowmote!  Rowmote is like your Mac’s remote control, but over the wireless network and even better! By tapping the Apps button, you get bonus abilities, switching between controlled programs, toggling the iTunes Visualizer, and more. Rowmote will even wake sleeping Macs.\n\nFEATURES\n\n - Control your Mac over a wireless network. No line of sight necessary.\n\n - Functions just like the hardware Apple Remote Control in:\n• Adobe Lightroom\n• Airfoil Video\n• Amarra\n• Aperture\n• BBC iPlayer\n• Beamer\n• Boxee\n• Decibel\n• DVD Player\n• Ecoute\n• eyeTV 3.x\n• Firefox\n• Front Row\n• Hulu Desktop\n• iPhoto\n• iTunes\n• Keynote ‘08 & later\n• kJams Pro\n• Kodi\n• Last.fm\n• Logic\n• Microsoft Powerpoint ‘04 & later\n• mPlayer\n• Movist\n• OpenOffice Impress\n• Preview\n• PandoraBoy\n• PandoraJam\n• PandoraOne Desktop\n• Photos\n• Plex, Plex Home Theater, & Plex Media Player\n• Quicktime\n• Rdio\n• Safari\n• Skim\n• Songbird\n• Spotify\n• Squire\n• The Tube\n• VLC\n• xbmc (Xbox Media Center)\n\n- SWITCH: Access your Mac’s Dock, launching & switch between all controllable applications on the Mac, toggle the iTunes visualizer, and more. Order & display customizable.\n\n - Click-and-hold works just like on the physical remote in applications; for example, holding the right button fast-forwards, while a single click is ‘next’. This is a feature no other iPhone remote control I know of does properly!\n\n- Sleep on demand; wake the Mac automatically\n- Pause the music or video automatically when you answer a call on your iPhone\n- Proximity sensor support to automatically turn the screen off if the device is face-down\n- Secure authentication\n- Optional dark interface\n- Connect via WiFi or Bluetooth (Bluetooth requires Personal Hotspot Bluetooth tethering)\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n\n • Mac OS X 10.4.0 or later.\n • Mac: The free Rowmote Helper program must be running on the Mac to be controlled. Download at www.rowmote.com. Some features require later versions of Mac OS X.\n\nRowmote is a steal! Couple it with Apple’s free Remote app to turn your iPhone or iPod Touch into the ultimate controller for home stereo, mobile presentation, or casual video viewing.\n\nThe artwork of Rowmote was designed by Rik Schennink."

Get automatic reminders for individual prayers. Supports various azan alerts as well as vibration only alerts\n\n* Pre-Prayer alerts. Get reminded of the next prayer 30 minutes in advance to help you prepare\n\n* Displays prayer times for: Fajr, *Ishraaq, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, Isha and Qiyam-ul-lail (Last 1/3rd of the night; Tahajjud Prayer)\n\n* Landscape Prayer Timetable. Turn your device landscape to see upcoming prayer times for the week / month / year. Best way to observe Ramadan monthly prayer times\n\n* Apple Watch app, as well as support for various watch-face complications. Please note: not all complications are the same. The \"InfoGraph\" watch face, for example, are limited (by watchOS) to show static information such as the next or current prayer time only.

Ishraq prayer is 10 to 12 minutes after sunrise. There is a misconception where Islamic websites and people use the word \"Ishraq\" and then give timings for actual Sunrise. Praying at sunrise is forbidden and must be performed after at least 10 minutes of sunrise. iPray for this reason adds 10 minutes to sunrise and labels it correctly as \"Ishraaq\".\n\n* Prayer Alerts will ONLY alert you with an initial Takbir. The full azan (and its length) is NOT supported by the iOS alert mechanism as there is a maximum limit of 30 seconds of audio playback."

      "label": "With Group SMS you can send an SMS text message to a group of contacts. Group SMS is the perfect app to send your Christmas and New Year greetings to your loved ones and friends.\n\nThese groups can be small or very large (Bulk SMS) and send to tens, hundreds or thousands of contacts. You can also send email to groups. Group SMS is ideal when you need to send the same message to any number of contacts.\n\nGroup SMS will show you the groups that are already defined in the Contacts app of your iPhone. It also allows you to create new groups as well as modify your existing groups and contacts.\n\nUsing the built-in Templates feature, you can reuse often-used text messages or emails that you need to send to groups.\n\nYou can also add attachments to your messages, like photos or PDFs.\n\nGroup SMS will send the SMS using the built-in Messages app OR you can use the special SMS gateway of Group SMS.\n\nThe costs of the SMSs will be charged by your mobile operator or you can buy SMS from within the app itself. If a group contains 12 contacts, you will be charged 12 SMS.\n\nWhen you have a very large group (more than 50 contacts), you can choose to bypass your own mobile provider and select to use the SMS gateway of Group SMS instead. This will allow you to send your Group SMS with less cost and with more control. This feature is also ideal for marketing campaigns. You can import a large set of numbers via a .CSV file.\n\nGroup Mail is always without costs. You can also forward email attachments to groups.\n\nFEATURES\n\n√ Text message a group (SMS)\n√ Text message very large groups (Bulk SMS)\n√ Email a group and forward email attachments to groups\n√ Text message to a CSV file of mobile numbers\n√ Text message with attachments (photo, PDF)\n\n√ Create groups\n√ Delete groups\n√ Rename groups\n\n√ Add contact to group\n√ Delete contact from group\n√ Edit contact information\n\n√ Templates\n\n√ Supports your built-in contacts and groups\n√ Supports your iCloud contacts and groups\n\n√ Uses built-in Messages app ór Bulk SMS Gateway\n√ Replies are received in Messages\n\n√ Uses built-in Mail app\n√ Forward attachments of any type\n\n√ Built-in video tutorials\n\nGroup SMS requires iOS 6 or higher and is localized in English, German, French, Italian, Spanish and Dutch.\n\nVideo tutorials are available on the web site (see link below) and in the app itself.\n\nREVIEWS\n\n\"Works Perfectly\" - USA\n\n\"This app does what it says it can, and does it very well.\" - United Kingdom\n\n\"WELTKLASSE.

      "label": "Note: This is the highest level of Bullet Flight (level M, Military). Also see BulletFlt L1 and BulletFlt L2 for lower-cost alternatives.\n\nKnight's Armament BulletFlight is a military-grade ballistic computer that provides quick solutions in the field. BulletFlight does not output information in table format but rather dynamically gives you the solution you need now to make that shot. Current weather conditions including temperature, pressure, humidity, wind speed, and  wind direction can be input, as well as angles to the target as measured by the built-in accelerometer. The app then provides highly detailed solutions out to 3000 meters. Your weapon profile includes your scope MOA/mRad per click, and hence when you provide a range to the target, the app will simply show how many clicks you need to change the scope by for that range and wind speed.\n\nIncludes over 1400 projectiles including carefully-measured G7 BC database for VLD bullets. BulletFlight's G7 data is courtesy of Bryan Litz and I recommend his book: http://www.appliedballisticsllc.com/index_files/Book.htm\n\nUp to five ballistic coefficients with corresponding velocity thresholds may be used for each profile to enhance accuracy, or use a single G1, G7, or G8 value.\n\nSeveral built-in profiles for the Army's M110 and M110C semi-automatic precision rifle, the Army's new XM2010 sniper rifle, the 14.5 inch SR16 rifle, The 50 BMG M107, .308 M40A3, .308 M24, and the 6.5mm KAC PDW allow you to get started quickly. You may alter these profiles, or add new ones.\n\nThis app was in combat use by military snipers in Iraq and Afghanistan. \n\nFeatures:\nBuilt-in profiles for common military rifles, but easily add more custom profiles.\nAccurate bullet database with most major brands.\n3000 meters range (2000 using simple screen).\nFast and accurate ballistic computation using G1, G7, or G8 ballistic coefficients.\nEasy to use interface yet powerful and full featured. All relevant data on screen all at once.\nUser interface designed to minimize chance of input errors.\n\"Simple Screen\" with distance wheel, but also \"Full\" screen where any exact range may be used.\nOutput in inches, cm, MOA, Mils, and scope clicks.\nOption for Metric units. In most cases imperial and metric are visible at the same time.\nDirect input for scopes with either MOA or mRad metric input (such as Schmidt & Bender).\nCalculates 360 degree wind drift using either degree of O'Clock format input.\nWind speed may be specified in either miles-per-hour or meters-per-second.\nAdvanced atmospheric model.\nUses GPS to locate nearest weather station and then automatically gets weather data and altitude for ballistic computation.\nSight-in weather may be logged and stored for automatic normalization to standard conditions. So you may sight in at any temperature or altitude and later be accurate at any other temperature or altitude.\nBuilt-in accelerometer will detect angle for improved accuracy.\nComputes actual BCs from collected data. Some users will do this for each log of ammo before a mission.\nBuilt-in mil-dot range calculator.\nCalculates bullet twist / stability with a highly-accurate formula.\nComputes bullet spin drift.\nBuilt-in help screen."

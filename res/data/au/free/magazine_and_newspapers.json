A valuable men's magazine. - This magazine truly shines with excellent, well written, interesting, and valuable articles. The first issue I've read so far is full of a variety of content that makes for a satisfying and entertaining read. It covered topics about health, working advice, girl advice, and cool gadgets just to name a few. And let's not forget the girls who are so beautiful they will break your heart. To be honest, I was not expecting too much out of a men's magazine, but this one changed my assumptions. This mag will remain on my newsstand for a long time to come.\n\n5 Stars - BrightsideRocket\nI have been looking for a mag like this for some time.

Around 75% of people with IBS experience symptom relief on a low FODMAP diet.\n\nThe app comes directly from the research team at Monash and includes the following:\n\n- General information about the FODMAP diet and IBS.\n- Easy to understand tutorials to guide you through the app and the 3-Step FODMAP diet.\n- A Food Guide detailing the FODMAP content for hundreds of foods using a simple 'traffic light system'. \n- A list of branded products that have been certified by Monash as low FODMAP.\n- A collection of over 70 nutritious, low FODMAP recipes.\n- Functions that allow you to create your own shopping list and add notes to individual foods\n- A Diary that enables you to record food eaten, IBS symptoms, bowel habits and stress levels. The Diary will also guide you through step 2 of the diet - FODMAP reintroduction.\n- The ability to adjust units of measurement (metric or imperial) and activate colour blindness assistance."

      "label": "Squeezy has helped thousands of women regain confidence in their pelvic floor. Pelvic health specialists around the world recommend Squeezy to their patients every day because it works.\n\nAround 30,000 people use Squeezy regularly to help them remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises. So if you are thinking about downloading Squeezy for your pelvic floor, you are not alone. \n\nAll women should be doing these exercises and some will be doing them as part of a physiotherapy programme.\n\nSqueezy is simple to use, informative and designed to help women to remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises (also known as Kegel exercises). \n\nFeatures includes:\n• A pre-set exercise plan that follows public health guidelines\n• A record of the number of exercises you have completed, compared to your target\n• Visual and audio guides for exercises\n• Exercise reminders with customisable settings\n• Educational information about the pelvic floor\n• “Professional mode” – if working with a pelvic health specialist, you can tailor the exercise plan to fit your needs\n• A bladder diary to keep track of your symptoms, if required\n• Simple and clear interface\n\nSqueezy has been clinically reviewed and approved by the NHS for its clinical safety, and is compliant with NHS Information Governance requirements.\n\nSqueezy won several industry awards including ehi Awards 2016, Health Innovation Network 2016, National Continence Care Awards 2015/16 and was a finalist for awards including Advancing Healthcare Awards 2014 and 2017, Abbvie Sustainable Healthcare Awards 2016.\n\nFor more about Squeezy and additional pelvic health information visit squeezyapp.com.\n\n*Apple Watch users*\nDuring your exercises you need to hold your finger on your Apple Watch face to keep it live and running. The play button changes to state ‘Hold’ when running an exercise.\n\nThis keeps your Watch from dozing off while your attention is focused on your pelvic floor. Most Watch screens go to sleep after 7 or 15 seconds (time dependent on your Watch settings). Squeezy has no control over the screen sleep time on the Watch; it has to obey your Watch settings. \n\nWe hope to be able to improve the Watch experience in future. In the meantime, we’re continuing the existing Watch support because many people find it helpful.\n\nIf you have feedback on the Apple Watch, please get in touch with the developers directly on help@squeezyapp.com.\n\n\nThis app has been translated into Saudi Arabian Arabic.\nتمت ترجمه هذا التطبيق الى اللغه العربيه ( المملكه العربيه السعوديه)‏"

      "label": "Meet Freya, your virtual birth partner from The Positive Birth Company! Freya will coach you through every single surge with a simple breathing technique and visualisation. She will help you relax between surges with a mix of guided relaxations, positive affirmations, gentle music and calming visualisations. Freya makes it easy for you to keep track of your surges and you can visit the log at any point to see how frequently your surges are coming and how long they are lasting. Freya will also let you know when your labour is established and when it might be a good time to contact your midwife. You will never birth alone with Freya by your side.\n \nTRACK YOUR SURGES\n\nIn hypnobirthing we refer to contractions as surges, as a ‘surge’ more accurately describes the sensation you’ll experience when in labour. Freya is the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the app store, designed specifically with hypnobirthing mums in mind, but can be used by anyone.\n \nPREPARE FOR BIRTH\n\nYou can also use Freya in pregnancy to help you relax and prepare for your birth. In fact the more you listen to the guided relaxations and positive affirmations, the more familiar they will become and the more effective they will be at helping you relax when it comes to birth.

You can also directly sync with the No.1 snoring tracking app - SnoreLab - to track your progress.\n\nOne of the main causes of snoring is weak muscles in the mouth area. SnoreGym is an exercise app which helps to tone your upper airway muscles to reduce snoring.\n\nSnoreGym will guide you through a set of clinically-proven exercises for your tongue, soft palate, cheeks and jaw.\n\nFeatures include:\n- Exercises to reduce snoring\n- Easy-to-follow animations\n- Clear and detailed instructions\n- Evidence-based workouts\n- Progress tracking\n- Sync to SnoreLab\n\nScientists have tested a set of mouth exercises which tone muscles in the tongue, soft palate, throat, cheeks and jaw. This research has shown that mouth exercises can reduce snoring, decrease the severity of sleep apnea, reduce disturbance of bed partners and produce better sleep and quality of life.\n\nIt is important to do these exercises regularly to reduce your snoring. We recommend at least 10 minutes a day for 8+ weeks.\n\nExercise now for quieter sleep!"

Triage | ATS Pro contains over 700 adult and paediatric triage scenarios based upon the Australasian Triage Scale.  The triage scenarios have been developed by experts in the field to sharpen your decision-making skills.  Triage | ATS Pro comes with 8 quizzes, all designed to test your limits:\n\n1) **NEW** Practice: We’ve included 75 of our most challenging triage scenarios to practice on.  No timers, no pressure, just practice.\n\n2) General: everyone and their aunt and nephew are coming to see you!\n\n3) 3 or 4?: you have only two choices, ATS 3 or 4, you decide. \n\n4) It's NOT 3: The wrong answer is ATS 3, so, what other ATS category are you going to choose?\n5) Paediatrics: Grab the bubbles, the kids are loose!\n\n6) Adults only: the bigger they are, the bigger the problem.\n\n7) **NEW** Adult Triage Sieve: You’re on scene at a major disaster, sieve your way through!  Decision-making flow-chart included to help you.\n\n8) **NEW** Adult Triage Sort: You’ve sieved, now sort! Decision-making table included to help you!\n\nTest your skills, challenge your friends and come back for more!\n\n\nDesigned by:\n\nWayne Varndell, Emergency Clinical Nurse Consultant\nAlister Hodge, Emergency Nurse Practitioner\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: The process of transitioning into the Triage Nurse role requires face-to-face education, clinical supervision and assessment within the clinical setting. While every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the information contained within the App, Triage | ATS Pro has been developed as an educational aid, not as a replacement for formal clinical supervision.  All triage scenarios are fictitious, any resemblance to real persons, living or dead, is purely coincidental."

The app's efficacy is supported by independent research studies, including a 2016 study by Huntington University published in the Journal of Hand Therapy.\n\n• Increases coordination and motor control in the hands and fingers\n\n• Works for kids and adults\n\n• Automatically creates performance and usage reports that can be emailed\n\n• Speeds recovery from injuries and stroke\n\n• Designed in consultation with Occupational Therapists\n\n• Turns the iPad into a therapeutic tool\n \nFor best therapeutic results the exercises should be done on a regular basis in short sessions. The exercises are designed to be repeatable and engaging.\n\nThe automatic tracking and reporting feature makes it easy for parents, teachers and occupational therapists to identify time on task and progress.  You can email the progress reports right from the app itself.\n\nMulti-user tracking is available as an in-app purchase. (Note to Volume Purchase Program customers: Consider buying Dexteria VPP instead. It includes multi-user tracking and you will pay a lower net cost than if you buy Dexteria and upgrade each copy via the in-app purchase. Just search \"Dexteria VPP\" in the app store.)\n\n                    *****\n\"Very impressed with this app. I've been looking for something like this for a very long time.\"  - from Apps for Children with Special Needs\n\n\"For occupational therapists, the one huge benefit is the ability to track the child's progress.\" - from YourTherapySource.com\n\nEditor's Choice Award from Children's Technology Review\n\n\"Outstanding app and I highly recommend it. Children are very motivated to use it. I’m a Pediatric Occupational Therapist and I use it to work on fine motor integration, fine motor precision, hand exercises, handwriting, writing speed, etc.\"  - Authentic app store review\n                    *****\n\n\n\nATTENTION LICENSED OTs: If you are a licensed OT and have comments about Dexteria, please submit a review and tell us what we did right and where we can improve.

      "label": "Simple, fast, yet more thorough than any other pregnancy wheel available for the iPhone, Perfect OB Wheel is better than just a replacement for your trusty paper wheel.\n\nHere's why Perfect OB Wheel is your best choice of gestational calculator:\n\n 1) Input flexibility: Start with one of:\n    • Last menstrual period (LMP)\n    • Conception date\n    • Estimated date of confinement/delivery (EDC)\n    • Ultrasound dating: Number of weeks and days gestation as of a given date (\"X Weeks\").\n\n 2) Input speed: Other wheels for the iPhone make you conform to them for entering your patient's information. Why not be able to choose based on how you are holding the phone and what else you are doing at the same time?\n    • Use the numeric entry pad (0 3 3 0 2 0 0 8) and immediately see the results, OR\n    • Spin the date wheel at the bottom of the screen and tap Next.\n\n 3) Thorough results: All the information you would expect from a classic wheel, plus more:\n   • Estimated Due Date\n   • LMP Date\n   • Conception Date\n   • 1st Trimester End Date\n   • 2nd Trimester End Date\n   • Gestational Age\n   • Conceptional Age\n   • Expected Fetal Length based on standard fetal growth curves\n   • Expected Fetal Weight based on standard fetal growth curves (\"How much does my baby weigh, doctor?\")\n\nResults are relative to 'today' by default; this can be quickly changed to reflect any date by tapping the 'today' button and selecting a new date.\n\n 4) Accurate results: Perfect OB Wheel provides exact dates and accounts for all calendar variance, including leap years. \n\n 5) Persistence: Perfect OB Wheel remembers the date and date type you last used and restores them when launched to streamline your workflow.\n\n 6) Perfect OB Tracker upgrade: Available as an in-app purchase update, the Perfect OB Tracker lets you track any number of pregnancies, with at-a-glance due date and gestational age and one-tap access to all the data Perfect OB Wheel provides.  A  picture and text notes can be kept on each patient. Postpartum tracking is also available. Passcode locking is available for HIPAA compliance."

This app features custom-designed animations derived from MBSImP™ research on swallowing physiology and impairment.

Includes an overview of normal swallow function, and links to other educational resources. \n\nAnimations are of adult physiology and include:\n\n• Normal Swallow, Lateral View\n• Normal Swallow, A/P View\n• Example of Penetration with Aspiration\n• Impairment of Anterior Hyoid Excursion\n• Impairment of Bolus Hold \n• Impairment of Bolus Transport\n• Impairment of Epiglottic Movement\n• Impairment of Esophageal Clearance\n• Impairment of Initiation of Pharyngeal Swallow\n• Impairment of Laryngeal Elevation\n• Impairment of Laryngeal Vestibular Closure\n• Impairment of Lip Closure\n• Impairment of Mastication\n• Impairment of PES Opening\n• Impairment of Pharyngeal Contraction\n• Impairment of Pharyngeal Stripping Wave\n• Impairment of Soft Palate Elevation\n• Impairment of Tongue Base Retraction\n\n\nUser Notes: \n\n• Animations depict adult physiology, including normal swallow. \n\n• Animations do not include narration. Visual tool only. \n\n• The animations included in this app accurately represent the anatomy and physiology of normal and impaired swallowing function. They were developed in conjunction with the evidence-based \"Modified Barium Swallow Impairment Profile,\" or MBSImP.\n\n• Rarely does one physiologic swallow impairment exist alone. This app highlights primary impairments, but co-existing impairments typically occur and the examples shown here are no exception.  \n\n• Available for iPhone and iPad."

      "label": "This app was built for anyone living alone. It provides a way to make sure that if you don’t respond, others will be notified. Instead of relying on products that require you to press a button when you need help (think \"I've fallen and I can't get up\" commercial), isn't it better if someone is notified when you DON'T press a button? Introducing the EyeOn App.   \n\n* You can set your own schedule for the app to \"check-in\". You can set the days of the week, time of day…as many (or as few) as desired. For example, the app can ask if you are ok every hour, only in the mornings/evenings, or every other day.  \n\n* You will receive a push notification at the scheduled time(s). This notification will ask if you are ok.  If you would rather receive a Text Message (SMS) check-in, please visit www.eyeonapp.com for details and pricing (US only).\n\n* If you press \"OK\", then the alert is reset for the next scheduled time.\n\n* If you fail to respond, then the app notifies up to 3 contacts by email.  For Text Message (SMS) alerts to your contacts, please visit www.eyeonapp.com for more details and pricing (Worldwide numbers allowed).\n\n* The contacts get a message stating that you have not responded and your last known location (location in email only).  You can customize the email sent to your contacts to provide specific instructions.\n\n* Reminders can also be scheduled.  They are just that - a custom reminder.  No response is required and we don't notify your contacts if you don't respond to a Reminder.\n\n* Pause feature - you can pause the service for hours, days, or weeks if you don't want to be checked on during a movie, vacation, etc.  This also works to skip the next check-in or check-in early.\n\nWhen first installing, you will be prompted to complete the names, mobile phone numbers, and emails of the user and for each contact. Then simply set a schedule for check-in times.\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT:\n\nPush Notifications - on the initial setup you will be asked to allow EyeOn App to use Push Notifications. This is mandatory for the app to function, unless you opt for the Text Message (SMS) check-in (visit www.eyeonapp.com for more details).\n\nLocation - although this is not mandatory, we can provide your location inside the alert email to your care providers if you do not respond. It will be the location where you were the last time you opened the app (keeping constant location would reduce battery life). You will need to give EyeOn App permission to use your Location.\n\nTimezones/Time Changes - EyeOn App adjusts for timezones and time changes when the app is opened. If you travel to a different timezone or have a time change, please open the app once for it to automatically correct to the new time.\n\nCancelation of Service - if you do decide to discontinue use of the service, please simply delete any Notifications you scheduled. If you delete the app without deleting the Notifications, it could take up to 24 hours for your account to be disabled and your contacts may receive false alerts during that time."

The data has been collected and processed by two university academics, who used 3D reconstruction techniques to allow the external and internal structures of the teeth to be explored in 3D in great detail. \n\nThe app also contains a guide to the morphology and features of the teeth, with 3D demonstrations of how they relate to the tooth in question. A major advantage of using real teeth is that many show interesting and unusual features, which would be seen on dental patients. These can be explored and are explained through an interactive guide."

      "label": "Bilateral Stimulation Therapy (BLST) is a neuropsychological treatment adapted from a treatment called EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing). EMDR is a gold standard treatment according to the World Health Organisation for the psychological treatment of trauma. Bilateral Stimulation is a key therapeutic tool used in EMDR. \n\nBilateral Stimulation simply means stimulation of both sides of the brain using eye movements, sound or tactile stimulation. Typically, it may involve moving your eyes from left to right whilst following a target or paying attention to sound in your left ear then to your right. Bilateral stimulation is referred to as a ‘bottom – up’ approach as it works on the emotion engine of the brain, the limbic system. This approach reduces emotional distress which allows the cortical areas of the brain (thinking, reasoning, planning) to become more active and effective. The effect of this approach is often experienced more quickly and easily.\n\nBecause this therapy uses one element of EMDR, it is called BLST so as to not confuse or give the user a wrong impression about the complete standard EMDR therapy. BLST uses one part of EMDR, and therefore 2can be practiced at home, work or any quiet environment where you can spend five minutes or so undisturbed much like meditation. For more information about BLST and EMDR please visit www.mromeopsych.com/blst\n\nThis minimal app uses bilateral click which, when activated, sounds alternately in each ear. The speed, tone and length of the practice can be set by the user. The App has two options: 1. BLST mode (bilateral stimulation with sound) and 2. FLASH (an adaption of Dr Phillip Manfield’s FLASH technique. Please visit https://www.flashtechnique.com for more information).\n\nThis app is a clinical tool for psychologists, psychiatrists, EMDR therapists and their patients. While information is provided at www.mromeopsych.com/blst, you should consult your EMDR therapist before using it. Please note: Persons suffering with complex PTSD Dissociative Identity Disorder, Borderline Personality, Schizophrenia or unstable neurological conditions (eg; epilepsy) should not use this product without consultation with your therapist.\n\nAs we are frequently updating this app to improve it’s functionality and increase its features, we ask that any comments or suggestions that you have, please contact us at admin@mromeopsych.com. Thank you."

If you have sleep apnoea, air stops flowing to your lungs for ten seconds or longer during sleep. In some cases, this can happen more than 30 times per hour all night. \n\nSleep apnoea affects more than three in every ten men, and nearly two in every ten women. Studies have shown that 80% of people with sleep apnoea are undiagnosed. \n\n**How the SleepCheck app works**\nSleepCheck records your breathing and snoring sounds while you sleep. SleepCheck then uses clinically proven machine-learning algorithms to assess your risk of sleep apnoea. \n\nIn just a few steps, you can find out if there is more to your snore.\n\n1.\tMake sure you are the only person sleeping in the room\n2.\tAnswer a few questions on your age, gender and neck size\n3.\tBefore you sleep, place your phone on your bedside table, press record and go to sleep\n4.\tWhen you wake up, stop the recording \n5.\tSee your results and understand next steps\n\n- Your privacy and data is protected.

      "label": "What is All the Feelzzz?\r\n\r\n\nAll the Feelzzz is designed specifically for and with input from the autistic community.  Autistic individuals often experience sensations (e.g., pain and discomfort) differently than neurotypical people do.  As such, All the Feelzzz is designed to represent these differences by providing graphical representations that attempt to capture a more complex, subtle, and/or multidimensional experience of feels that may resonate more with autistic people and people who process sensory input differently in general.  These complexities, and the multidimensional nature of feels for autistic people, must be accounted for in any tool or strategy that aims to support the challenges that can come with attempting to heal or minimize unwanted feels, seek help, or simply express oneself in ways that are authentic and unmasked.  Thus, qualities such as texture, intensity, imagery, color, and a  full range of tactile qualities are represented in All the Feelzzz graphics! \n\nThe images have been carefully conceptualized and developed in hopes that one or many qualities of a Feelz card will resonate with a person, and therefore, help them to name, understand, and express their experience in ways that are not forced by external sources (e.g., traditional pain scales; “How much does it hurt?”, which often pose problems for autistic people).  Indeed, there may be others outside of the autistic community that may find this way of communicating supportive of their needs.  We hope it will be a tool used widely by those for whom it resonates.\n\nWho is this App for? \n•\tAutistic people on their own, in collaboration with their partners and carers, or with partners guiding and facilitating the process. All the Feelzzz is designed to provide autistic individuals with an alternative means of communicating “pain, discomfort, and perceived difference” in their bodies.  This system is most appropriate for individuals who use symbols (e.g., spoken words, pictures, signs, augmentative systems, etc.) to communicate, although the graphics are intended to provide access to those who may not be reading or be able to express themselves in the middle of a Feelz.\n•\tFamily members and carers-  All the Feelzzz is designed to support the ability of someone to be a Responsive Partner to an autistic person experiencing “pain, discomfort and perceived difference in their body.”   It is also designed to help the partner be a Supportive Partner / Facilitator who has tools and strategies for helping autistic people use the Feelz as a means of expressing their experiences.\n•\tTeachers-  All the Feelzzz is a differentiated approach that teachers will find useful to support and empower their autistic learners’ authentic voice in educational settings.\r\n•\tHealth care professionals and staff in clinical and hospital settings who are supporting autistic patients- All the Feelz can be used to support patients who are not able to accurately use standard pain scales to communicate their dynamic experiences with difference in their bodies.  It utilizes accessible sensory based / visual formats accessible to individuals who have a wide range of communication styles,\r\n\nNote: Although it has been specifically crafted by and for autistic experiences, it can be used for anyone who might experience feels differently and/or find it challenging to describe what’s going on inside their body to others when the need to do so arises.\n\nThe Feelz cards are intended to assist in the identification of bodily feels, but there is much power in the fact that no words are needed to show the card, or cards, selected to partners! After all, being able to communicate clearly when you need someone to be aware of what is going on in your body can be massively beneficial to your health, safety, and general well-being.  \n\nMay the FeelZzz be with you... literally... in your pocket... in your palm... whenever you need them :)\n\n- Amy and Jacquelyn\nAutism Level UP! ©"

      "label": "The \"Voice Meter Pro\" app for the iPad, iPhone and iPod touch, is a simple, but effective app that helps children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD's), voice disorders, or any other child (or adult) monitor the volume of their own voice in a Fun and Engaging way.\n\nChildren with Asperger’s and other ASD’s often have difficulties producing the appropriate voice volume in different settings.  Some children on the autism spectrum speak too quietly.  Others speak too loudly.  Still others do not compensate adequately for the social milieu or ambient noise level. \n\nUnderstanding abstract concepts, such as the volume of one’s voice, can be difficult for children with ASD's.  It’s well understood that adding a visual component to the otherwise abstract concept can often be very helpful for individuals with ASD.\n\nOK so how does the app work?\n\nWell….if a child is talking to quietly a blue background with a cartoon character struggling to hear is displayed. If a child is talking too loudly the background changes to red and the character puts it’s fingers in its ears. If the volume level is acceptable a green background with a smiling happy character is displayed.\n\n• The on screen “volume thermometer” dynamically displays the volume level as it changes. \n\n• There’s a \"Sensitivity\" slider so the adult can adjust the volume sensitivity to suit both the user and the environment.\n\n• There’s also a \"Dampening\" slider. This helps avoid the meter bouncing around in between words by introducing a slight delay before any movement is shown on the “volume\" thermometer.\n\n• To give the user total control over the app the Upper and Lower limits of the \"Green\" (acceptable volume area) can now be adjusted by the user.\n\n• For convenience the app works in both portrait and landscape modes on all the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad.\n\n•  the iPhone version of the app has a switch to enable the iPhone to vibrate should the upper threshold level be exceeded for longer than 4 seconds.\n\nWe want to make this app the very best it can be and to this end we have included a feedback form inside the app for users to submit any issues or suggestions as to how it can be improved. \n\nWhy not download the app and give it a try?...... you might find it a very useful tool."

      "label": "Anyone who snores at night is usually exhausted and not well rested the next morning. But not only that, the (spouse) partner is also prevented from sleeping because of the noise. \n\nMost of the time you will be confronted with the words: \"I have to fall asleep before you, otherwise you will start snoring and I won't be able to sleep.\" \n\nSnoring can thus become a real test of patience and there are even said to be cases where partners are no longer (able to) sleep in the same room.\n\nAlthough the number of men who snore is higher, there are also many women who snore. Therefore, this problem affects all genders.\n\nThere are several possible remedies on the market. But not all of them deliver what they promise, are expensive or very unwieldy.\n\nThis Anti-Snore-App is an anti-snoring solution that works through a completely \"natural\" concept. \n\nIn the past, did your partner, with a (gentle) nudge, make you change your sleeping position to stop snoring?\n\nThis practice is a common method between many couples in bed to stop the other from snoring. \n\nThis approach often serves its purpose. However, it is usually the case that both are awake at night and then have to fall asleep again. \n\nOur Anti-Snore-App automatically fulfills exactly this purpose without anyone having to wake up for it.  \n\nAfter a short orientation period, our Silent Night app promises you: \n\n- restful and regenerative sleep for everyone involved\n- reduced disturbance of the partner's rest\n- improved oxygen intake due to the shifting of the body\n\nOur app uses state-of-the-art algorithms from the field of machine learning. We use it to evaluate your current sleeping sounds and provide you with unconscious assistance through vibrations. \n\nOf course, your data remains completely recorded on the device and will be deleted immediately after evaluation. This means that not only your restful sleep but also the protection of your data is in the forefront.\n\nLikewise, all processes operate directly on the device, data and radio connections can be independently deactivated by you (recommended!) overnight.\n\n----\nDisclaimer for medical services\n\nThis Anti-Snore-App is not a medical device and is not intended to replace professional medical advice and/or diagnoses. The Anti-Snore-App is not intended to diagnose or treat respiratory failure or other diseases/medical conditions. Please consult a licensed physician before making any decisions or taking any actions that may affect your health, safety and well-being. Do not ignore professional advice based on things you have seen, heard or read on the app, website or social media.

In just ONE app there is 1) a gestational age calculator, 2) an ultrasound biometric calculator, 3) a fetal weight calculator, 4) a list of key weeks and trimesters, 5) an age-adjusted risk table for trisomy 21 and aneuploidy, 6) a BMI calculator, and NOW 7) an Apple Watch app is included with your purchase!\n\nThe OB Wheel Pro 7 is a state-of-the-art gestational age calculator (also known as an obstetric or pregnancy wheel) that is used every day by doctors, obstetricians, midwives, nurses, and pregnant women. The OB Wheel Pro 7 is a professional tool that replaces the need for multiple apps and it greatly enhances the functionality of those worn-out cardboard wheels without compromise. \n\nThe OB Wheel Pro 7 accurately determines the estimated delivery date (EDD), or due date, of a pregnancy based on the first day of a woman's last menstrual period (LMP), or from the date of conception, or from a known gestational age (GA) on a known date, e.g. from an ultrasound measurement, or from fetal biometry like Crown-Rump Length (CRL), Femur Length (FL), and BiParietal Diameter (BPD). Additionally, for appropriate gestational ages, The The OB Wheel Pro 7 estimates fetal weight and displays the number of days completed and remaining. \n\nThe OB Wheel Pro 7, besides calculating GA from fetal ultrasound biometrics, enables clinicians to also calculate Estimated Fetal Weight (EFW) from FL, BPD, Head Circumference (HC), and Abdominal Circumference (AC) using the most appropriate published reference formula using the maximum and most appropriate parameters.\n\nPrenatal care providers know that there are key gestational ages where testing or interventions are needed. The OB Wheel Pro 7 lets providers see at a glance when these items should be scheduled.\n\nFEATURES\n• Includes Apple Watch app! \n• Gestational Age Calculator from LMP, EDD, Conception Date for any reference date\n• Gestational Age calculated from specific date and gestational age (e.g. ultrasound)\n• Gestational Age Calculator using fetal biometrics (CRL, FL, BPD)\n• Fetal Weight Calculator using HC, AC, FL, BPD\n• Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator\n• Age-Adjusted Risk Table for Trisomy 21 and aneuploidy\n• List of key completed weeks during pregnancy\n• Pregnancy days completed and remaining, and dates for each trimester\n• Remembers last-used EDD\n\n\nPRO TIPS: \n• To enter Gestational Age, CRL, FL, or BPD for a specific date (like for an ultrasound exam), tap \"Today\", enter the desired date, then tap on the button displaying the gestational age to change that button to display options for entering a specific GA, CRL, FL, and BPD. \n• When using the GA calculator, double-tap a date to change the value to the current date.\n• When using the EFW calculator, double-tap a value to clear the value of the selected parameter."

Since the flow of qi and xue through the channels is not constant but is rather of a rhythmic character, certain acupuncture points are more accessible and responsive at certain times and the ability to influence the circulation of energy via these particular acupuncture points is greater at these times. \n\nThis application allows you to:\n- Calculate the Heavenly Stem and the Earthly Branch of the respective year, month, day and hour (Bazi, the Four Pillars of Chinese astrology)\n- Determine the principal acupoint according to the current date/time or any user-defined date/time and location\n- Determine the principal acupoint according to the Eight Methods of the Intelligent Turtle (Linggui bafa)\n- Determine the principal acupoint according to the so called Selection on Day Time according to the Heavenly Stems (Najia ba)\n- Calculate the optimal acupoints with the corrected time (True Local Time), which considers Daylight Savings Time, Longitude and Equation of Time)\n- Set your current location with the help of the iPhone built in localisation function or set location manually"

For example, a low oxalate diet with a typical daily restriction of 50 milligrams can easily be managed by getting facts about specific food Oxalate levels.\n\nCalcium Oxalate are found in 80% of the population that have Kidney Stones.\n\nThis app presents data of approximately 500 food and ingredient items with in every case a formal reference about the source of data provided.\n\nThe convenience of the continuous availability of this app facilitate making eating decisions when:\n- at the grocery store, \n- at the restaurant, \n- as a guess during a meal or \n- simply at home while planning a meal.\n\nGone is the limited and inconvenient Oxalate paper list posted on the refrigerator door.\n\nEvery food item listed in the app is presented with:\n- a thumbnail image,\n- its name,\n- the preparation method (if applicable),\n- a typical serving size and \n- the oxalate level for that serving size.\n\nSelecting an item from that list will present further details such as:\n- a larger image,\n- the groups it belongs to,\n- low Oxalate level food alternatives (if applicable and available) and\n- the formal reference of the source of information.\n\nThe data is conveniently organized to access it in various ways.  Data can be sorted:\n- alphabetically, \n- by groups (e.g Vegetable, Meats, Soups...),\n- by oxalate level or\n- alphabetically within each oxalate level category.\n\nThe app also has a search function that immediately present search results as you type avoiding having to type more than necessary.  During a search, one can select a food item to view details and come back and carry on searching without having to retype the initial search.  At any time, the search can be modified or cancelled.  Search is available in any sort mode.\n\nA food item can be hidden using the swipe to the left gesture.  Hidden food items are now accessible on a separate list via one of the menu items.  A hidden food item can be un-hidden (returned to the main list) by the swipe to the left gesture.\n\nThe app database is local to the device and therefore the app does not require once installed.\n\nThis application should not be used to replace professional medical advises.

      "label": "Choose This not That for Fatty Liver. Inside this colorful app, you will find easy to follow suggestions on how to improve your health through nutrition and the food choices you make every day. This app provides comprehensive and actionable nutrition guidelines for how to reduce your risk, prevent and combat Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease, its symptoms and complications.\r\n\r\nRecent research shows that there are a number of nutrients and natural food items that play a significant role in dealing with NAFLD. If you rather tackle health issues and risks through proper nutrition and lifestyle changes then this app is for you!\r\n\r\nA number of powerful, unique and interactive features make this app so different and superior to others in the market:\r\n\r\n• Separate dietary guidance for NAFLD AND its combination with the following most likely health issues: diabetes type 2, excess weight or obesity, high cholesterol, high triglycerides, metabolic syndrome, PCOS, prediabetes and stress. \r\n\r\n• Is this food good for me? This feature answers the common question if a food of your choice is helpful or harmful to your personal situation. And it does so in an easy to understand and colorful graphic form.\r\n\r\n• Top-5 recommendations on what to eat/do, and what not to.\r\n\r\n• Food Suggestions. The best food choices within a food group, based on your personal profile. An extremely valuable tool when at restaurants or when grocery shopping. Over 850 natural food items and growing number of recipes are included. \r\n\r\n• Suggestions on appropriate life style choices, alternative therapies and herbal remedies, when such options are promising and available to you.\r\n\r\n• ACTIONABLE information on what is good, what is bad, and what is neutral for your condition(s). We don't just point you to a food group. We single out specific food items, and give you an ordered list of helpful and harmful foods within each food group. \r\n\r\nThe primary sources used by this app are US government agencies such as USDA, NIH (National Institute of Health), PubMed, and leading clinics & universities.\r\n\r\nPersonal Remedies is the producer of the world's first e-dietitian and publisher of the largest collection of health and nutrition apps for chronic conditions. Based in metro-Boston, home to the highest ranking healthcare providers and academic institutions in the world.\r\n\r\nThis app is updated by our team on an ongoing basis. Updates happen seamlessly, and do NOT require frequent inconvenient downloads.\r\n\r\n“This technology was developed using the most current clinical evidence-based information that is available in the US. Behind this technology there is a team of expert clinicians, scientists, endocrinologists, oncologists, and other specialists who are passionate about bridging the gap between expert knowledge and the patient.“ \r\nKatya Tsaioun, PhD, Nutrition, Tufts University; L.D.N.\r\n\r\n“Proper nutrition and other alternative treatments show great promise in preventing and treating many of the illnesses that we deal with every day. I encourage all my patients to follow appropriate nutrition and research other options for themselves. The Choose This Not That series are an excellent step towards improving people’s knowledge in this area.”\r\nShahin Tabatabaei, MD\r\nMass General Hospital; Harvard Medical School\r\n\r\n“The Choose This Not That series of apps provide dietary recommendations focused on common chronic health problems. They are easy to understand and thus easy to implement into daily life. Most doctors would find it difficult to discuss dietary recommendations at the level of detail found in the series. They should serve as a valuable complement in helping people manage chronic illnesses through dietary and lifestyle modifications.”\r\nAndrew S. Lenhardt, MD \r\nLahey Clinic, Beverly, MA"

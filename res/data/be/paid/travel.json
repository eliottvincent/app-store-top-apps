In map view, you can tap any wifi icon where wireless information is available, and use the button to copy the password to the clipboard. The map is available offline so you don’t need an Internet connection to use WiFox when you’re traveling.\n\n*Click Copy to easily paste passwords into wireless network settings.\n\n*Users can also add passwords they find from airports around the world. Those passwords are then sent to foXnoMad for verification and approval before they are added to the map.\n\n*In ‘List View’ you can update passwords for airports already added (when you’ve noticed some changes). As you travel you can also rate the wireless hotspot information to let us know if the details worked for you or not. Based on traveler feedback, the connection information is updated, verified, or removed.\n\n*WiFox icons indicate how fresh, reliable, and highly rated a given airport wireless network’s information is.\n\n*WiFox is updated continuously with information travelers, pilots, and other users send through the WiFox app, foXnoMad website, and foXnoMad Facebook and Twitter accounts. WiFox currently has wireless Internet information for over 700 airports around the world.\n\n*The map is updated automatically upon opening the app (when you have Internet access) or by clicking the ‘Update’ button on the map or refresh icon on the List View.\n\n*WiFox also protects users on free (open) wifi networks by telling you the proper network name, so you don't unintentionally connect to a rogue or malicious access point.\n\nWiFox Premium subscriptions unlock the following features:\n\n* Automatic notifications of the highest rated password, with network connection information, as soon as you land. WiFox Premium detects the airport you're at and displays the most relevant wifi network name and password so you can get online as soon as you step off the plane.\n\n* View password ratings to see which passwords work best throughout an airport so you can connect to the strongest and most reliable connection.\n\n* Be able to add your own password ratings within WiFox. Premium user priority ratings ensure the best wifi passwords are always displayed.\n\nAfter a 30-day free trial period a $24.99/year purchase will be applied to your iTunes account following confirmation of a Premium upgrade. Subscriptions will automatically renew unless canceled within 24-hours before the end of the current period. You can cancel anytime with your iTunes account settings. Any unused portion of a free trial will be forfeited if you purchase a subscription.

      "label": "Hola, all you independent travelers to Cuba! Want to explore Cuba your way, with Cuban locals in the lead and without the usual commercial mumbo jumbo? Experience complete freedom and get value for your money! Use Cuba-Junky’s Casa Particular Directory app as your simple and user friendly ‘Yellow Pages’ while planning, traveling and exploring!\n\nWhy you need this app when you plan to visit Cuba \n- Cuba friendly and explorer friendly (simple, practical and cheap!)\n- Several updates a week with new casas and features \n- Even more casas in the app than on our website\n - Direct contact with the casa through the app\n - Save yourself  $5 per night by using the app to contact the owners directly  \n\nWhat are casas particulares? \nCuba’s version of B&Bs offer the island’s best lodging values for anyone who likes doing things authentically, or in this case: the Cuban way. You can find hundreds of casas in this app. They are rooms, suites, or sometimes entire apartments. The Cuba-Junky casa directory app is current, convenient, and easy to use. It provides casa photos, phone numbers, email addresses, Facebook and website links—all for about US $5!  \n\nOnline, offline and more \nBut there is more. The casa particular directory app is very frequently updated at no extra charge. And you can access other types of info through the app, such as the weather forecast, or use it to contact your casa.\n\n  No commission: save $5 per night! \nBy using this app and contacting a casa directly, you often save the $5 per night commission that the owner normally charges for bookings made through a third party. Casa owners pay no commission or other costs to Cuba Junky. Say this to the casa owner and get that discount!\n\n  Some free Cuba advice?\n Cuba-Junky’s advice is: make a reservation for your first night in Cuba and after that just “go with the flow.” Using your Cuba-Junky casa particular app, it will be easy to find casas while in Cuba, or to call ahead to a casa in the next town you plan to visit. You can talk to the owner directly, find out what’s available, and at what price.   \n\nWhy does this app cost about $5?  \nJust because Cuba Junky have to keep it running. We charge no hidden $5 per night commission. We just love Cuba. If you do too, go and enjoy it, and while you’ re at it, help us keep Cuban locals in the lead! ¡Gracias amigos!"

Street View coverage is displayed in blue.\n\n\nEASY TO USE\nWalking through panoramas has never been easier using the interactive, expandable mini map that also displays your viewing angle and field of view. Virtually traveling abroad is even more immersive and fun with Live Panorama mode: Turn around in the panorama simply by rotating the device.\n\n\nAPPLE WATCH APP\nStreets is the only app capable of displaying 360° Street View panoramas on the Apple Watch. Just turn your wrist or pan to turn around in any direction. Use the digital crown to zoom. Streets for Apple Watch automatically syncs favorites and recent searches with your iPhone.\n\n\nOPEN FROM MAPS & OTHER APPS \n“Open location in Streets” displays nearby panoramas from websites, from „Maps“ or „Contacts“, or from many other apps that support sharing of locations and addresses. If you’re already using our location finder app Where To?, you’ll also be able to take advantage of a tight, bidirectional integration.\n\n\nDRAG & DROP\nOn iPad or Mac, drag a pin location from the Maps app, a contact, or a textual address into the Streets app to find nearby panoramas. Even geotagged photos can be dropped in Streets to find 360° spherical images near the photo location.\n\n\nCOMMUNICATIVE\nShare Street View panoramas using drag-and-drop (on iPad) or the share sheet. Handoff and AirDrop let you easily transfer the currently viewed panorama between multiple devices. Mark panoramas as favorites that are automatically synced between devices. Rename favorites and organize them in folders.\n\n\n2000+ GALLERY PLACES \nMore than 2000 hand-picked “Gallery Places” show spectacular places such as museums, castles, national parks, ski slopes and even underwater attractions. Geysers in Yellowstone national park, old masterpieces in Amsterdam’s van Gogh museum or NASA’s rocket launch pad in Cape Kennedy are just a few of the breathtaking places waiting to be explored. Gallery places also include background information such as descriptions and links.\n\n\n\nMORE FEATURES\n- Supports iPad Pro, Split View and Slide Over\n- Supports keyboard navigation (with Bluetooth or Smart Keyboard)\n- Spotlight search also finds Streets panoramas\n- Siri can create reminders with a link to the currently displayed panorama\n- Supports the “Shortcuts” app\n\n\nWHAT OTHERS SAY\n\n“I highly recommend Streets 3.“\n- John Voorhees, MacStories\n\n“it’s hard to imagine Cupertino doing it better than Streets 3”\n4.5/5 mice\n- J.R. Bookwalter, Macworld\n\n“If you haven't migrated to Google Maps on iOS because you're OK with Apple Maps but you miss Google Street View, here's a pretty easy solution.“\n- Mel Martin, Engadget\n\n“Thankfully, with Streets, you can continue using Maps and still be able to quickly pull up Street View without ever feeling like you’ve left the app.“\n- Jordan Khan, 9to5Mac\n\n\nTwitter & Facebook\nCheck us out on Twitter: @futuretap\nand Facebook: http://facebook.com/streetviewapp"

Ideal for almost anything that requires measuring outdoor distance traveled such as walking, running, driving, boating, or hiking.  Note that GPS does not work well under a roof.  For best results, use outdoors.\n\nBenefits of the paid version:\n- Landscape and splitscreen support.\n- Ability to have multiple trips.  Each trip can be stopped and started independently.\n- Receive notifications while the application is closed at distance intervals of your choosing.\n- Custom units readout.  For example, you want to know how many calories you have burned.  You can customize this to include anything that has a linear relationship with distance traveled.  This can be different for each trip.\n- No advertisements.\n- Export trips via email and optionally restore later.\n\nDisplays:\n- Distance\n- Time elapsed\n- Speed (average or current)\n- Displacement (straight line distance from your starting point) This can be hidden.\n\nDistance units include:\n- Kilometers\n- Miles\n- Nautical miles\n- Meters\n- Feet\n\nSpeed units include:\n- Kilometers per hour\n- Miles per hour\n- Nautical miles per hour\n- Meters per second\n- Feet per second\n\nOther features:\n- Large font adjustable display.\n- Accurate to within 1 percent when compared to most car odometers under normal driving conditions.\n- Includes a lock to help prevent accidental reset of your trip. After unlocked, it locks back in a few seconds, or you can lock it yourself.\n- Approximates distance traveled in some GPS dead spots such as driving through a tunnel by adding the as-a-bird flies distance to your trip.\n\nPlease also note:\n- GPS Odometer does run in the background if you leave it running.  Be sure to pause the trip when you are finished or battery life will be negatively affected.  The timer stops when the trip is paused.\n- To change the display, tap the unlock button and notice the three green boxes that temporarily appear. Each button adjusts a different part of the display.\n- You can change the language to English in the application settings.\n\nPlease visit the web page for more details."

It shows informations about the region where a car is registered and links to the maps application, so that you can see on the map where the car is coming from and use the maps application to let it show you the way to that specific location. A global full text search or simple search for plate keys is another part of LicensePlate. Once you've spotted a plate you can mark it and build up your collection of plates you've seen on the street.\n\nThis application is ideal for longer road trips. Be sure to have an answer when your kids play a License Plate quiz again... and hey, i like that Pub quiz idea...! \n\nCountries:\nAustria, Switzerland, Germany, France, Great Britain, Italy, Ireland, Norway, Poland, Greece, Czech Republic, Northern Ireland, Spain, Lithuania, Slovakia, Croatia, Romania, former GDR, Japan, Turkey, Ukraine, Slovenia\n\nNo regional informations, basics:\nBelgium, Denmark, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Sweden, Latvia, Hungary"

All updates are free.\n\nNow in their 11th year as a mobile app, and their 13th online, the Wise Pilgrim Guides are the go-to source of up-to-date information on the Camino de Santiago.\n\nThe app is updated regularly with new content and new features and offers you the ability to leave tips for pilgrims following behind you.\n\nThis guide covers the Camino Portugués and its three most common variations; the Central Route, the Coastal Route, and the Variante Espiritual. It has been redesigned and now works almost exclusively offline (to share your comments with others will require a data connection).  As more an more albergues share their WiFi this becomes less of an issue, and the guide will tell you which ones offer WiFi.\n\nAccommodation Directory:  \nA full directory of Albergues, camping, hotels, pensions, paradors, and cases rurales.  Over 400 in total, with special attention to those that can be booked online.\n\nStageless Guide:\nNo more \"stage anxiety\" or guide created bottlenecks.\n\nMaps:  \nOffline and online versions of a beautiful topographical may will give you a good view of the terrain ahead.\n\nPhotos: \nPhotos of albergues, monuments and other points of interest along the way.  Currently 400+ images and growing.\n\nScrollable Elevation Map:  \nThis one is hard to show with just a screenshot, but the elevation that appears at the top of every city page scrolls East to West.  One complete elevation, from St. Jean Pied de Port to Santiago, uninterrupted by page folds.\n\nComments:  \nAlbergue closed early for the season?  Have a restaurant that you want to share, or perhaps one to warn others about?  Every location in the app gives you the opportunity to leave a comment and to read the comments left by others. No registration necessary.\n\n¡Buen Camino and thank you for your support!"

It comes with detailed walk route maps and powerful navigation features enabling you to see the best of the city. No need to hop on a tour bus or join a tour group; now you can explore all the city attractions on your own, at your own pace, and at a cost that is only a fraction of what you would normally pay for a guided tour.\n\nSightseeing walks included in this application are:\n\n* City Orientation Walk (11 sights)\n* Porto's Museums (6 sights)\n* Places of Worship (9 sights)\n* Fashion Shops (5 sights)\n* Specialty Stores (5 sights)\n* Porto's Landmarks (12 sights)\n\nNo Data Plan or Internet is Needed, and No Roaming either. All the data used in this app is built into the software, so you can follow the city walks or use the city map without internet access or cellular data plan. No need to pay the costly roaming charges when traveling to foreign cities. The app works with your iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad.\n\nThe powerful navigation assistance includes:\n\n* Walk routes clearly displayed on map.\n* Precise walking directions from one sight to the next.\n* `FindMe` displays your exact location and Auto Tracking displays your movement on the map (this feature is not supported by the iPod Touch and iPad wifi models).\n* Built-in compass to show you the direction.\n* Create your own walks to see the attractions you like.\n* A detailed city map which can be used independently for your other traveling needs.\n\nPlease visit our website at www.GPSmyCity.com to find city walks for over 470 cities worldwide.\n\nNote: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. This app gives you the option to turn off the GPS tracking in the background to prolong the battery life."

      "label": "DroneMate is a regularly updated map of the recreational drone laws for every country in the world. The information is pulled from official sources and contacts so you know where you can fly, the rules to abide by, and the places where you should leave your drone at home. DroneMate can save you time, money, and hassle at customs as many countries (even major tourist destinations) won't let you bring a drone into the country. The map is available offline so you don’t need an Internet connection to use DroneMate when you’re traveling.\n\n*U.S. state laws are also included.\n\n*The information is pulled from official sources - there is a lot of misinformation about drone rules and laws floating online - DroneMate gives you a clear listing of the laws, rules, and places where they haven't been completely defined yet.\n\n*Shows information for specific cities, touristic sights, and other areas where drone use has special rules or restrictions.\n\n*DroneMate is updated regularly in real-time with information obtained from a number of official sources.\n\n*DroneMate has a user comment system where travelers can add their experiences droning, importing, and dealing with authorities in each specific country. The comments are useful in situations where the authorities themselves are confused or unaware of the laws, non-common situations, and other anecdotes that can help other travelers.\n\n*Users can also post questions in the comment section for other travelers or the administrator.\n\n*All comments are rated by other users, so the most useful, informative responses are highlighted on top of the others.\n\nAfter a 30-day free trial period a $24.99/year purchase will be applied to your iTunes account following confirmation of a Premium upgrade. Subscriptions will automatically renew unless canceled within 24-hours before the end of the current period. You can cancel anytime with your iTunes account settings. Any unused portion of a free trial will be forfeited if you purchase a subscription.

No hidden costs.\n\nNow in their 11th year as a mobile app, and their 13th online, the Wise Pilgrim Guides are the go-to source of up-to-date information on the Camino de Santiago.\n\nThe app is updated regularly with new content and new features and offers you the ability to leave tips for pilgrims following behind you.\n\nThis guide covers the Camino del Norte from Irún to Santiago de Compostela and includes all of the alternate routes along the way. It has been redesigned and now works almost exclusively offline (to share your comments with others will require a data connection).  As more an more albergues share their WiFi this becomes less of an issue, and the guide will tell you which ones offer WiFi.\n\nAccommodation Directory:  \nA full directory of Albergues, camping, hotels, pensions, paradors, and cases rurales.  Over 500 in total, with special attention to those that can be booked online.\n\nStageless Guide:\nNo more \"stage anxiety\" or guide created bottlenecks.\n\nMaps:  \nOffline and online versions of a beautiful topographical may will give you a good view of the terrain ahead.\n\nPhotos: \nPhotos of albergues, monuments and other points of interest along the way.  Currently 400+ images and growing.\n\nScrollable Elevation Map:  \nThis one is hard to show with just a screenshot, but the elevation that appears at the top of every city page scrolls East to West.  One complete elevation, from Irún to Santiago, uninterrupted by page folds.\n\nComments:  \nAlbergue closed early for the season?  Have a restaurant that you want to share, or perhaps one to warn others about?  Every location in the app gives you the opportunity to leave a comment and to read the comments left by others. No registration necessary.\n\n¡Buen Camino and thank you for your support!"

The app works with your iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad.\n\nThe powerful navigation assistance includes:\n\n* Walk routes clearly displayed on map.\n* Precise walking directions from one sight to the next.\n* `FindMe` displays your exact location and Auto Tracking displays your movement on the map (this feature is not supported by the iPod Touch and iPad wifi models).\n* Built-in compass to show you the direction.\n* Create your own walks to see the attractions you like.\n* A detailed city map which can be used independently for your other traveling needs.\n\nPlease visit our website at www.GPSmyCity.com to find city walks for over 470 cities worldwide.\n\nNote: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.

If Apple Maps cannot find a route between map pins, then neither can Road Trip Planner.  Please test the area you wish to travel using Apple’s Maps app to ensure that the area can be routed.  If it cannot be routed, please submit the issue to Apple.  If Apple Maps cannot perform routing in the area you wish to travel then neither can Road Trip Planner."

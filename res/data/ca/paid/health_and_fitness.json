I've been trying to get into meditation for a while now and I've found other apps or videos I've tried have been repetitive or not very good. The meditations on here are so easy to follow and the app is very user friendly. I'm always sceptical about spending money on apps but this one is so worth it.  ******\n\nI have used many meditation apps but like this one best because it offers a variety of guided meditations to use in different situations or for different purposes. They vary in the amount of time required so the app is very flexible. I also like the stats which encourage you to practice regularly. Plus I can add meditation that I do outside of the app and track that too. I highly recommend whether you are a beginner or an experienced meditator. *****\n\nHERE TO HELP\nBuddhify is made by a values-led family business and we love hearing from you. Your feedback, suggestions and comments make all the hard work feel so worthwhile and makes the app better as we continue to make buddhify as effective, accessible and beautiful as it can be.

      "label": "If you love working out with Apple Watch, but you need more advanced fitness stats, HealthFit is for you.\n\nBy analyzing the workout data stored in Apple Health, HealthFit provides the kind of indispensable tracking and insights you normally only get from premium subscription services. But if you still prefer to use apps like Strava or Training Peaks, HealthFit has you covered with reliable automated background syncing.\n\nONE FITNESS APP THAT DOES IT ALL\n\nHealthFit combines a comprehensive activity feed with insightful fitness statistics and all your essential health metrics in one beautifully designed app. So you don’t need to go hunting around in multiple apps to track your fitness progress.\n\nSYNC YOUR WORKOUTS SEAMLESSLY\n\nSyncing with platforms like Strava can be a fiddly, laborious process and the results aren’t always great. HealthFit solves this by syncing automatically in the background after every workout. So you don’t have to lift a finger, it just works. It can even sync your entire workout history.\n\nWith support for more than 25 platforms (see below), HealthFit is fitness hub, keeping all your workout data in sync.\n\nWORKOUTS: THE ACTIVITY FEED YOU REALLY NEED\n\nBrowse your workouts in the Activity Feed, with route maps, photos and essential stats all visible at a glance. Tap on a workout for a treasure trove of essential insights, like customizable Heart Rate Zones, Training Load and Recovery Times.

HealthFit mines that data to provide essential charts and summaries that show you exactly how you’re doing, with indispensable insights that will help you to raise your fitness game.\n\nStats are broken down by activity type, with handy Year Comparison charts. You can monitor changes in your Fitness (CTL), Fatigue (ALT), and Form (TSB), Heat Maps reveal where you’ve been training, and your Explorer Score reveals how much you’ve been getting around.\n\nHEALTH METRICS: THE STATS THAT MATTER\n\nHealthFit provides a curated view of your health metrics focusing on the essential stats every athlete needs to know, whether you’re a serious competitor, a weekend warrior, or just beginning your fitness journey.\n\nTAILORED TO YOUR FAVORITE FITNESS ACTIVITIES\n\nUnlike most fitness apps, HealthFit doesn't just focus on running and cycling. We treat all activity types equally, presenting your most frequent activity types more prominently, with specially tailored stats and charts.\n\nUNBEATABLE ON PRIVACY\n\nAll your data stays on your iPhone where it belongs. Our app runs on your phone, not in the cloud. We don’t use any trackers to monitor your activity and we never will.\n\nSUPPORTED SYNCING PLATFORMS\n\nStrava, TrainingPeaks, Final Surge, Selfloop, Smashrun, MapMyFitness, MapMyRun, MapMyBike, Ride with GPS, Cycling Analytics, Today's Plan, Runalyze, Suunto, 2PEAK, Xhale, Komoot, Map My Tracks, Stages Link, TrainAsONE, Tredict, Intervals.icu, Nolio.

It’s perfect for exercise at home.  \n\nAthletes often modify Clock Yourself exercises outdoors for sport-specific agility drills, by visualising a much larger circle and running between the coordinates.  \n\nSimilarly, people who are unable to walk can modify Clock Yourself to practise reaching with their arms, or wheelchair agility! \n\nIf you think you’re too slow to use Clock Yourself, you’re probably wrong.  \nIf you think you’re too fit to use Clock Yourself, you’re definitely wrong! \n\n\n\n\nWHY DID WE MAKE CLOCK YOURSELF?\n\nThe Clock Yourself concept originated in neurological rehabilitation. Now anyone can use it to harness their neuroplasticity.  \n\nIt was developed by Australian physiotherapist @MegLowryPT and software developer Dave Wallace. \n\n\n \nWe had 5 goals: \n\n1. Make it fun - Clock Yourself exercises are so entertaining that you’ll show your friends at parties! \n\n2. Make it versatile  - Both the stepping speed and the cognitive complexity are in your control.  \n\n3. Make it evidence based - This is a volitional step training method. Volitional stepping trains faster steps in all directions to improve your chances of catching yourself during a fall.  \n\n4. Make it portable - There is no need to set up mats, wires or sensors. It also works offline. It only requires internet for your initial download from the App Store.  \n\n5. Make it affordable - This is a once off purchase for pocket change. It has no recurring subscriptions and no advertisements.  \n\n\n\nIS CLOCK YOURSELF AVAILABLE IN OTHER LANGUAGES? \n\nYes and no. \n\nAt this stage, all of the buttons and instructions are in English only.  \n\nHowever, if you click the Options button within each challenge (except for the Simple Colours challenge) you can choose to play the audio prompts in six other languages. \n\nMandarin \nJapanese \nFrench  \nGerman \nSpanish \nDutch  \n\nWhat are you waiting for?  Go ahead and Clock Yourself!\n\n“A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new” - Albert Einstein"

      "label": "“Worked great for his bedtime—the look on his face was so calmed.” Christi (mother of 3 week old)\r\n\r\nThe Baby Shusher is a soothing sounds machine to calm & stop baby crying cycle\r\n\r\nThe Baby Shusher App is a revolutionary new tool for parents that will calm baby easily using soothing sounds. This sleepmatic sounds machine is created using an ancient but doctor-tested and approved technique to help soothe your fussy baby calm with a shusher sound in cradle. \r\n\r\nA simple baby shusher with soothing sounds for baby that works on a single click, making calming sounds like baby lullaby that would work instantly and can be played for hours, recommended by parents, baby photographers, and doctors dealing with babies.\r\n\r\nBy creating calm sounds, safely stop the baby from crying with a rhythmic “shush” sound that engages a baby's natural calming reflex by reminding them of still being in the womb. The shush baby app helps to soothe baby calm and increase the baby sleep timer.\r\n\r\nThe amazing Sound Equalizer allows the app to \"listen\" to your baby crying or not every three minutes and automatically adjusts the shush volume to baby cry volume till baby calms down (so when the baby is wailing, shush is loud; when baby goes quiet, volume settles into a soothing background shush sound to relax baby).\r\n\r\nA newborn sleep magic baby sound machine that works best for a newborn baby to calm down quickly and manage baby sleeping patterns. A sleep aid that creates calming sounds for babies in the form of a shhh sound sleeper that will stop your baby crying, calms down easily, and put baby to sleep. \r\n\r\nThis shhh app calm baby instantly by creating a shusher sound, helping the baby relax in minutes using calming sounds for kids.  This sleepmatic app works like magic for the crying baby and helps parenting so much easier as baby calmer. \r\n\r\nAfter more than two years of testing and research with real moms and real babies, having sudden and long crying baby issues, we came up with the following very valuable feature list of baby soothing sound.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n- Safe and easy to use baby calming sounds machine. \r\n- Much more effective than simple lullabies or standard white noise.\r\n- Perfectly works for hours in the background and when the phone is locked\r\n- Adjustable Shush baby sound Timer Options (from 15 minutes to 8 hours of continuous shushing!)\r\n- Automatically adjusts the shush volume to baby crying volume.\r\n- Shush sounds played in low light “dark mode” ( night mode) to avoid extra mobile light as baby sleeps.\r\n- Work in other Apps on your Phone while still using the Baby Shusher App.\r\n\r\n*Note: Turn your phone on silent/mute to let the app do its magic.*\r\n \r\n \r\nWhat Real Moms are Saying About the Baby Shusher:\r\n\r\n“I wish I would have known about this sooner. It is truly a miracle for me and baby to have a good night’s rest together!” Mercedes (mother of 3 months old)\r\n\r\n“It is a must try for yourself.” Isabel (mother of 3.5 months old)\r\n\r\n“I wasn’t sure after the 1st time I used it, but it proved to us that it worked better and better thereafter.

You can set it to wake you if you are in light or medium sleep either 15 or 30 minutes before your set alarm time. This helps you feel more refreshed. \n\nThere's an optional sleep cycle buster that you can turn on to give you a light tap at 5 minute intervals in a 15 or 30 minute window before your alarm to take you gently out of deeper sleep. \n\nNot only that but it will even automatically measure your waking pulse just before the alarm sounds, which is a valuable measurement of recovery.\n\nIf you ignore the alarm on the Watch, you can also set a safety alarm that will play on your phone. This will speak and/or play a chosen song from your music library. \n\nThere's also auto scheduled alarms in case you forget to set your alarm before bed. \n\nIf you use AutoSleep our auto sleep tracker, you can use the new ultra smart alarm features. You can now be woken up after a desired amount of sleep, quality sleep or when your sleep bank is back in credit. You can use this in conjunction with a latest wake time if required. You can even set a bedtime reminder that looks at your required sleep, sleep efficiency and latest wake time to give you a reminder for the optimal time to go to bed. \n\nWhen you turn on your alarm, it can automatically tell AutoSleep that you have gone to bed so that time to fall asleep can be tracked.\n\nIf you use Apple HomeKit then you can run scenes for key events in AutoWake like turning off your bedside lamp and setting your room temperature for sleep. \n\nAutoWake requires an Apple Watch running WatchOS 4 or higher. Advanced features requires WatchOS 5.\n\nAutoWake works fine with Do Not Disturb and Theatre/Cinema mode. \n\nAutoWake requires at least a bluetooth connection between your iPhone and your Apple Watch during the time that you are asleep. You can use Flight Mode on your iPhone, but make sure that you turn on bluetooth.\nIf you user Screen Time, make sure that AutoWake is in your exclude list.\n\nAs with all of our apps, there is no tracking, no analytics, no snooping. Your privacy is very important."

      "label": "Anxiety Release shows you how to release anxious thoughts and feelings naturally, by harnessing the power of your brain. It does this by combining guided instructions and focused attention with bilateral brain stimulation. Bilateral stimulation is a treatment element of EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization & Reprocessing), a revolutionary treatment which is based on the use of sensory stimulation to alter anxiety-provoking memories and responses. Over 30 randomized controlled studies of EMDR attest to the efficacy of this process. \n\nBecause bilateral stimulation appeals to the unconscious, sensing part of the brain, there is no need for effortful thinking or struggling with feelings.  All you have to do is LISTEN and your brain will do the rest! The App consists of;\n1 x brain training session\n2 x guided anxiety management sessions\n1 x pure bilateral stimulation session (audio & visual)\n1 x safe place exercise\nProgress Log function\nPowerful Bls brain visual \nThis App is suitable for both clinicians and clients\n\nCaution: Persons suffering with complex PTSD or mental health problems, multiple psychological trauma or unstable neurological conditions (eg; epilepsy) should not use this product without medical supervision."

At the specified alarm time, the bells will begin to ring in a pre-defined pattern - starting out softly and slowly and gradually getting louder and more frequent.  You'll come out of your slumber slowly and peacefully.  No more being jolted awake.\n\n+ After setting the alarm, the app can be put in the background - allowing you to use other apps.  At the specified alarm time, the alarm pattern will begin.\n\n+ Choose from five pre-defined patterns with varying bell schedules and escalation lengths.\n\n+ Choose from six different bells of varying size and metal compositions - from bright and clean to deep and complex with lovely overtones.\n\n+ You may enter journal notes upon awakening - great for recording your dreams before the memory fades.  You can then go back and review your journal entries and you may export the journal via email.  For privacy, you may set a password to prevent unauthorized access.\n\n+ To save battery, you may lock your device's screen and the alarm will still work.  Either start the alarm and press the lock (sleep) button, or turn on the \"Auto-Lock\" setting.\n\n+ This app uses the same amazing bell sounds used in our Insight Timer meditation timer.  Here are some app store comments pertaining to the bells:\n\n  \"Best sounding bells of any meditation app so far\" - sibergrrl\n\n  \"The bell samples in this app are gorgeous\" - LairBob\n\n  \"Several different bell sounds to choose from and they all feel 'live'\" - VaderPi\n\n  \"Great Sound Quality\" - KarlAgathon\n\n  \"The tones are stunning\" - hellsleeve\n\n  \"Beautiful bell sounds\" - Wolf94114\n\n  \"Wonderful digital bell sounds\" - zenji\n\n  \"The bell sounds are lovely\" - pngwen\n\nOther Features:\n\n- Snooze from 1 minute to 30 minutes\n\n- Sure Wake: Optional LOUD backup sound\n\n- Seven colors available for time display\n\n- Optionally keep phone from sleeping\n\n- Huge landscape time display\n\n- App works even when phone is sleeping (locked)"

They will be automatically placed in your AM and/or PM routine as recommended.\n\n\n• ADD CUSTOM PRODUCTS\n\nYou can add custom skincare products from other brands by selecting the option in the top-right menu in the Routine section or from the Custom tab in the Products section.\n\n\n• USE YOUR ROUTINE FOR LAYERING ADVICE\n\nThe products are listed in the recommended layering order, along with advice for when and how to use each product.\n\n\n• KEEP TRACK OF USAGE TO AVOID CONFLICTS\n\nEach morning and evening, check each product off your list to keep track of which treatments you have used. This will allow the app to prevent any conflicts by showing you which products should be avoided.\n\n\n• TRACK YOUR SKIN'S PROGRESS\n\nAny time you notice your skin is looking particularly good or bad, you can make a note of it by pressing on the face icon next to the morning or evening routine. You can also add a comment to note down more details for your own record and add photos to track your progress.\n\n\n• ADD PHOTOS\n\nYou can add photos of your skin to your diary tracker and also add photos of custom products.\n\n\n• REMINDERS & TIMERS\n\nYou can set up notifications to remind you about your daily skin regimen. You can also set timers for products which require a specific wait time. Both can be found in the Settings.\n\n\n\n*** Advanced App Customization ***\n\n• RE-ORDER YOUR ROUTINE\n\nIf you don't wish to follow the recommended layering order, you can choose to re-order the products to fully customize your routine by selecting the option from the top right menu (with 3 dots) of the Routine section. You can also change the order of the layer steps, for instance DECIEM recommends oils before moisturizers but some users prefer the other way around.\n\n\n• USE CONFLICTING PRODUCTS\n\nWhen we recommend not using a product due to conflicts with other products or because you've reached the usage limit, you can choose to ignore the warning and use it anyway. You will then have the option to permanently ignore conflicts on that specific product.\n\n\n• SCHEDULE PRODUCTS\n\nYou can choose specific days of the week for a product if you wish. For instance, you may wish to make it so that the \"AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution\" only appears in your routine on Tuesdays and Fridays.\nYou can also choose dates of the month, e.g. the 1st and 15th of every month.\nAnother useful option is to schedule products for every X days, so you could choose every 2 days to alternate.\n\n\n\n*** Recommended for skin concerns... ***\n\n• Dry & Dehydrated Skin: Achieve plump, healthy-looking hydrated skin.\n• Acne-Prone Skin: Reduce inflammation to help support clear skin.\n• Blemishes & Congestion: Reduce inflammation and brighten the skin.\n• Sensitive Skin: Keep your skin moisturized with this gentle routine.\n• Mature Skin & Wrinkles: Promote youthful skin and reduce the signs of aging.\n• Pigmentation Problems: Gently exfoliate and brighten skin tone.\n• Oily Skin: Rebalance your skin for a healthy, fresh look.\n\n\nPlease note, Skincare Routine (previously known as \"Skincare Regimen Organizer\") has no connection with DECIEM, The Ordinary or any other skincare brand."

Combine that with regular kegels and you'll reach ejaculation slower, and be able to stop yourself at the last minute when you get there.\n\nFEATURES\n\n• Kegels & Reverse Kegels. Don’t make the mistake of just training regular kegels… reverse kegels are even more important for male sexual stamina.\n• Detailed Training. Never done a kegel or reverse kegel? Don’t worry, we teach you exactly how to do it.\n• Daily Reminders. If you want to last longer in bed, then you need to practice regularly! We remind you when it’s time for your next exercise. \n• Level Up. As your PC muscles get stronger, you’ll move up in difficulties, giving you greater and greater ejaculatory control.\n• Choose Your Difficulty. Already an experienced kegel practitioner? Skip the easy levels and start where you feel challenged.\n\nBENEFITS OF KEGELS\n\nHere’s everything you get by training your PC muscles guys:\n\n• More intense orgasms \n• Longer orgasms\n• Potential for orgasms without ejaculating, and  multiple orgasms\n• Delayed ejaculation and improved ejaculatory control\n• Boosted libido\n• Stronger, fuller erections\n• Increased ejaculatory power"

I bought a new iPhone to be able to use it. DBT skills are priceless. I had tried every, other DBT and CBT app. This one follows the traditional DBT program exactly, and is the only Diary Card. Before I had this app, I'd seldom fill in my diary card. Now that I have it, I don't have to keep track of paper, and I rarely miss a day. I can fill in my Diary Card discreetly, from anywhere, anytime, and send it directly to my DBT coach. I no longer have to worry about someone coming across my Diary Cards. You can brush up on skills, use it for distress tolerance suggestions, tailor it to your needs, and even journal. I appreciate that I can add personal goals to my diary. Thank you for this app!\" - iTunes US Review\n\n\"***** I am in IRL-DBT and this app is the perfect complement. Oh. I love that the app is so flexible, that you can make it kind of your own, and the layout is so nice, simple, yet beautiful. For me, a true life-saver! Genius! Without a doubt the best app in my IPhone... Get it now!\" - iTunes Sweden Review\n\n\"***** Perfect! Worth the money!\" - iTunes US Review\n\nAs an educated consumer, it's important to know to whom you're listening. DBT Diary Card was created by a Ph.D. psychologist trained directly by Dr. Marsha Linehan and at the Duke University Medical Center; we are experts in DBT, providing consultation to many in our community. And now we're giving it to you!\n\nA DBT app can have 3 parts: \n\n- A reference manual\n- A behavior tracker\n- A skills coach\n\nDBT Diary Card has all 3 of these parts and utilizes the iOS platform in ways that the other apps available don't and can't.\n\n+ PDF generation\n+ Notification Pane support\n+ Password protection\n+ Advanced text editing\n+ Media playback\n\nWhat DBT Diary Card has to offer:\n\n- Skills. LOTS of them. Every DBT skill you've ever heard about in a group is in here. It can be your quick reference to your skills so that you don't have to carry around your book or binder. Every skill is described in readable language to help you understand them easily and it's all just a quick tap away.\n\n- Emotions. All the \"basic\" emotions are presented, again with descriptions and explanations a quick tap away.\n\n- Behaviors. The most troublesome are pre-loaded.\n\n- Coaching. If you know you need to use a skill but can't think of which one or can't remember how to choose, use the app. The coaching can be your virtual therapist. \n\n- Complete customizability. Are you working on something different or do you have a different understanding of a particular skill or emotion? Change it. It's that easy. You are not wedded to the way it's presented in the app. It's all completely customizable.\n\n- 911 skills.  Put your emergency skills a tap away. You can call directly from the app, listen to your distress tolerance music, remember what apps help in the moment. \n\n- Email. You can email your therapist your diary card on a weekly basis automatically, you can do it manually whenever you'd like or you can have the app remind you.\n\n* Telephony features require an iPhone and voice service."

Scaramella-Nowinski, Psy.D.\nClinical and Research Pediatric Neuropsychologist\nFounder/Director, Neuropsychology Diagnostic and Rehabilitation Center\nFounder/Director, Neuroscience Learning Initiative\n\n______________________________________________________________________________________\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\n1.

You can train as usual with your favorite fitness or running app. All you need to do is install PULSALARM on your Apple Watch.\n\nFeatures of the Apple Watch App:\n- Vibration and/or warning tone when the set pulse limits are reached\n- Vibration and/or signal tone when returning to the set pulse range\n- Pulse limits can be deactivated individually\n- Large, easy to read display of the current pulse\n- Fast adjustment of pulse limits (also possible while running)\n- Works together with all known fitness, training and running apps that can be started on the Apple Watch\n- Does not write data to Apple Health\n- You can use the app on your Apple Watch without having your iPhone with you\n\nFeatures of the iPhone App:\n- Calculation of your maximum heart rate\n- Individual calculation of the 5 intensity ranges (depending on your maximum heart rate) \n- Adoption of the pulse limits from the training zones\n- Setting the maximum and minimum pulse limit \n- Large display of the current pulse\n\nImportant note: without the use with an Apple Watch, the functional range of the app is limited, as no permanent pulse measurement can be carried out.\n\nNo advertising, no tracking, no third-party codes. Developed with passion and programmed in Germany.\n\nWhy use PULSALARM additionally? \nMany running apps include the pace as a target in their training plans. However, the same speed can mean a high intensity for one person and a low intensity for another. It is therefore helpful to consider your heart rate instead of speed to determine and maintain the right training intensity. \nPULSALARM helps you to do this. It turns your Apple Watch into a heart rate monitor. \n\nWhat is the big advantage?\nYou no longer have to look at your Apple Watch during your workout and still know whether you are exercising within your personal heart rate zone. Also ideal in colder months, when your Apple Watch is hidden under a jacket or long-sleeved shirt and you can't look directly at the display while running.\n\nFor whom is PULSALARM suitable?\n- Ideal for run beginners, as they can control themselves better and protect themselves from overstraining.\n- Ideal for ambitious runners, as they can train more specifically in their intensity ranges and thus increase endurance and performance.\n- For all athletes and fitness enthusiasts who are interested in heart rate monitoring during their training with their Apple Watch.\n\nSummary:\nWith the PULSALARM app on the iPhone you can determine your 5 intensity ranges based on your maximum heart rate. You can enter your maximum heart rate directly or have it calculated. Set your personal maximum heart rate limit, which you do not want to exceed during training, and your minimum heart rate limit. When these limits are reached, your Apple Watch will alert you by vibrating and/or beeping."

      "label": "Slow Eats is an interval timer app aimed at helping you slow down and stay mindful during eating. Slow eating facilitates a healthy relationship with food and can ultimately lead to weight loss.\n\nEating slowly has many possible benefits:\n    ● Promotes weight loss by giving your brain more time to receive fullness signals\n    ● Helps you better absorb the nutrients in your food\n    ● Improves digestion\n    ● Makes you feel calmer and more in control\n    ● Increases your enjoyment of food\n\nChoose between three types of timers:\n    ● Bite Timer: Slow down how fast you eat by creating a set pause between each bite.\n    ● Meal Timer: Slow down how fast you eat by defining set eating and break windows during your meal.\n    ● Seconds Timer: Create a mindful pause before you get more. Give yourself time to feel full before deciding you need more.\n\n______________________________________\n\n~ What users are saying about the app ~\n\n\"I’ve never written an app review before, but I need to write one for this app. I got an Apple Watch and was determined to use it to lose weight. Between closing my rings and using this app, I have lost over 25 lbs. Even more important than any one accomplishment: it helped heal my unhealthy relationship with food.\"\n\n\"I eat way too fast. I get hungry and just smash my dinner every day and then often feel bad from over eating. This app is exactly what I was looking for. It’s simple, it’s easy to use, and it works. I love how I don’t have to watch a timer I just wait for the tap on my wrist. I’m already building healthier eating habits by using this app. THANK YOU!!\"\n\n\"Have been trying to slow down and be able to better listen to my fullness cues when I eat! This watch app does the trick!\"\n\n\"I tell anyone who will listen how much I love this app. I have the icon on my watch face and I use it for every meal and snack. So easy to use and it has helped me so much as I’ve been trying to slow down while eating. Another bonus is that the developers are so responsive and helpful! Hands down my favorite app!\"\n\n_______________________________________\n\nStart building a healthier relationship with food today by simply slowing down.\n\nLearn More:\n- https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/eating-slowly-and-weight-loss#thorough-chewing\n- https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/mindful-eating-guide\n\nAvailable on the Apple Watch, iPhone, iPad, and Mac."

This app calculates the weights you should use, based on your one rep max, for the 3-week Smolov Jr. and 13-week Full Smolov Squat protocols. The app also makes it easy to keep track of where you are in the cycle.\r\n\r\nThis Russian squat cycle has also been used by many for other lifts such as the bench press, shoulder press and deadlift with big jumps in strength. Smolov isn't for new lifters, but if you have some experience under your belt (like with 5/3/1, starting strength, 20 squat, etc.), then this may be a great lifting protocol for you."

      "label": "This application is a sidekick to the beastmaker 1000 and 2000. It has been designed to assist the user into gradually getting stronger on a fingerboard. The app does this by way of prewritten workouts which are often general and aim to improve all trainable grips on the board. Some are specific (2000 series only at the moment) which aim to improve, sloper strength, pocket strength and crimp strength. \n\nThere is also a new custom workout program fully adjustable and includes the 1000,2000 and micros, so if you have your own hang regime and different timings then that is all programmable and can be saved.\n\nBoth the workouts and custom timer now record hang contraction time (time spent actually hanging off the board) We recommend most users get up to around 20:00 minutes on this clock whilst doing their workouts.\n\nOn the Workout screen after you've selected your work out it is now possible to adjust set and hang times. Users who are only finger boarding and are having a rest day prior to and after training may wish to do up to 3 sets and 7 hangs. Other users may prefer to go for 2 sets and 6 hangs, this is what we'd consider an average and more suited to people doing additional types of training.\n\nPlease note the grades for the workouts aren't actually meant to relate to anything other than themselves. E.G. 5c is easier than 6a but harder than 5b. If you find 5a hard on the 1000, use a weight removal technique such as putting one foot on a chair in front of the board or using a pulley with weights on. More advice on this and other things are available in the general advice section on the Workout Ratings page.\n\nTo record your hangs press the record button (red circle icon) whilst resting. The Workout Ratings function is much improved and should now be a really useful training aid which records gradual progress and improvement.\n\nFingerboard gains take time, remember to warm up thoroughly and move on to more difficult hangs at a slightly slower pace than you think you should to give pulleys time to catch up with muscles. For example 10% strength gains over a year is brilliant improvement. 5% is still effective training.\n\nBest of luck with the training, happy hanging and we hope this helps with the motivation."

The most honest measurements you can take are pictures.\n \nFit-stitch uses both of these measurements so you can see how you’re really progressing. \n\nWith Fit-Stitch, you can create Before & After pictures to capture your ongoing fitness transformation. \n\nStudies have shown that tracking your progress increases the success rate of fitness training, resulting in more people staying on track and achieving better results.\n\nPeople are busy and usually forget to track their progress - that’s why Fit-stitch has built-in reminders."

Calculate your max safely and easily, and then track it over time, on any lift with our easy-to-use calculator!\n\nIn the simplest terms, your 1RM is the amount of weight you can lift for one rep on any given lift. In general, it’s good to know your max for key lifts like the squat, bench press, and deadlift, but your 1RM is critical even if you never plan to train that heavy.\n\nMany lifting programs are designed with a percent of your rep max in mind, and may call for something like using 65% of your 1RM for a given exercise. When you see that, you have to either test for your 1RM or estimate it. Testing your 1RM can be pretty intense, and it requires a high degree of caution to avoid injury.\n\nFortunately, you can estimate your 1RM without testing it! Exercise scientists have devised a formula that's fairly accurate for most people, which is what powers this calculator. Our calculator makes it easy to calculate and track your 1RM and multiple percentages of it for every lift in the book!\n\nFeatures:\n\n· Calculate your 1RM and percentages\n\n· Choose from a variety of lifts (deadlift, bench press, squat, etc.), or add your own\n\n· Track and chart your 1RM history for each type of lift\n\n· Add notes each time you calculate your 1RM\n\n· Improve your weight training with articles by Bodybuilding.com experts\n\n· Choose imperial or metric system\n\n· Incredibly easy to use!"

You can also perform remote CSV exports on the website. Health data is automatically synced to the service multiple times per day in the background, so there is no need for opening the app on your phone anymore. The data is end to end encrypted between your phone and your browser, thus nobody except you can read it.

Aggregation based types (e.g step count)\n2. Record based types (e.g body mass)\n3. Workouts and workout routes\n\nAggregation based types can be exported with aggregation by hours, days, or months. The export of record based types contains all entries from the Health app.\n\nHealth Export is compatible with the Shortcut app, thus you can integrate your health data into any automated workflow.\n\nI think your privacy is very important, thus I do not collect any of your health data and I do not share your health data with any analytics provider.\n\n-----------------------------\nAggregated data types:\n-----------------------------\nActivity:\n- Apple Watch stand hours\n- Distance cycling\n- Distance downhill snow sports\n- Distance swimming\n- Distance walking / running\n- Exercise time\n- Flights Climbed\n- Stand time\n- Step count\n- Swimming stroke count\n\nEnergy:\n- Active energy burned\n- Basal energy burned\n\nHeart rate:\n- Heart rate\n- Resting heart rate\n- Walking heart rate\n\nNutrition:\n- Caffeine\n- Calcium\n- Carbohydrates\n- Cholesterol\n- Energy consumed\n- Fat saturated\n- Fat total\n- Fiber\n- Iron\n- Potassium\n- Protein\n- Sodium\n- Sugar\n- Vitamin A\n- Vitamin C\n- Vitamin D\n- Water\n\nWheelchair:\n- Distance wheelchair\n- Wheelchair push count\n\n-----------------------------\nRecord based data types:\n-----------------------------\nAudio exposure:\n- Environmental sound levels\n- Headphone sound levels\n\nBlood:\n- Blood glucose\n- Blood pressure (Diastolic)\n- Blood pressure (Systolic)\n- Insulin delivery\n\nBody:\n- 6 minute walk test\n- Alcoholic beverages\n- Body fat percentage\n- Body mass\n- Body mass index\n- Body temperature\n- Handwashing\n- Height\n- Lean body mass\n- Mindfulness\n- Oxygen saturation\n- Respiratory rate\n- Sleep: Time asleep\n- Sleep: Time in bed\n- Tooth brushing\n- VO2 Max\n- Waist circumference\n- Walking steadiness\n- Walking steadiness notification\n\nHeart rate:\n- Event: High heart rate\n- Event: Irregular heart rhythm\n- Event: Low heart rate\n- Heart rate\n- Heart rate variability (SDNN)\n- Resting heart rate\n- Walking heart rate\n\nReproductive health:\n- Basal body temperature\n- Cervical mucus quality\n- Intermenstrual bleeding\n- Menstrual flow\n- Ovulation test result\n- Pregnancy test\n- Progesterone test\n- Sexual activity\n\n-----------------------------\n\nAccessibility should be an important part of every application.

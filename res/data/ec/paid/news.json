However, some sites set up their feeds to only show a portion of each entry, you know, to get you to click through to their actual website. We find that really annoying, and we're sure you do too.\n\nWhich is why, unlike other RSS feed readers, that either push you into a browser (in-app or otherwise), or depend on third party text parsing services and require you to be online to fetch the full text of one article at a time (which makes it no different from having to click/tap through to a website), in lire, you get your favorite RSS feeds as they should've been. You don't need to click through to any website (though, you do still have the option to, if you really wanted). It takes your favorite partial feeds, does its magic, and converts them in to full feeds, so you don't have to click/tap on those annoying 'Read more' or 'Continue reading' links.\n\nOnce they're cached, you don't even need to be connected to read your full-text feeds.\n\nUse as a standalone feed reader, sync with iCloud,\n\nor,\n\nsync with any of the several services: Feedly, Feedbin, FeedHQ, The Old Reader, Inoreader, BazQux Reader, Newsblur, Feed Wrangler, FreshRSS, Miniflux, Nextcloud News, Tiny Tiny RSS."

      "label": "Songbot is a powerful tool that can search every radio station in the world for the song you want to hear. Just type in the song name or artist you want and start listening immediately. Or choose from a list of currently playing songs from your favorite genre.\n\nNo subscription fees. No ads between stations. No hidden fees or trial periods. Songbot makes tens of thousands of radio stations into one mega searchable jukebox with none of the stuff you dislike from other music apps. It even shows you the song history of your favorite FM/AM radio stations, so you can find out what you just heard.\n\nUltimate Song Finder\nSearch for a song and listen to it right now. Our songbots are actively searching over 90,000 (AM/FM/Internet) stations and finding out what they’re playing in real-time. Tell your personal Songbot what you want to hear, and it'll find the station that's playing the song right now. No more waiting for your favorite song to come on.\n\nAll Your Local AM/FM Radio Stations\nSongbot will give you all of your local AM/FM radio stations as well as the ones slightly further away from your radio's reception reach all in high quality. You can even enter another town's zip code to get stations playing in another city.\n\nListen to Today's Most Played Songs\nSongbot will also list the most played songs over the last 48 hours on radio, and then let you listen to them instantly. Songbot even lists the top songs by genre, so there's something for everyone.\n\nView a Station's Song History\nSongbot lets you see all the songs you just listened to, so you can listen to them again at anytime. You can even see what was playing in the past few hours on any station and be able to start listening to any of those songs listed. It's almost like rewinding a radio station.\n\nPlay YouTube Videos with the Screen Off\nSongbot not only gives you the music videos to the songs you want to hear, you can turn off the screen and continue playing the audio by simply pressing the power button twice, and then pressing Play. You can also use other apps while the audio plays in the background.\n\nSmart Favorites\nYou can save the song, artist or station as part of your favorites, so you can always get to what you want with just one tap. We also keep track of your song history for you, so you can always find that song that you just heard but forgot to add to your favorites.\n\nFind Stations Similar to Your Favorite\nIf you have a favorite AM/FM radio station, Songbot can help you find similar ones from around the world. The great thing is that you don't have to be near them to listen to them. Songbot connects you to them through the internet. And since it's only audio, it will use less bandwidth than listening to a song on a video website. It also doesn't have to do all that buffering that a video website would have to do. The songs play almost instantly.\n\nDiscover New Stations\nTired of the same stations you've already heard on your car radio? In Songbot 2.0, we've included premium stations. Now you can find stations that are playing music that you otherwise wouldn't find in your car stereo system. For example, perhaps you like K-Pop, Anime, or Cinematic music. Perhaps you want a station that only plays Eminem songs. We have that for you!\n\nRadio Talk Shows and Sports Included\nNo matter if you're looking for Glenn Beck, Alex Jones, Rush Limbaugh, Rachel Maddow, or NPR; Songbot will find a station for you that's playing their talk show. Want to listen in on the latest game? Songbot will help you find a station that's broadcasting it live.\n\nAdvanced Recommendation Engine\nWant to find other musicians similar to your favorite band? Use Songbot's advanced recommendation engine to pick out radio stations for you based on your favorite artists. Or you can just start listening to a station, and Songbot will suggest other stations to listen to that play similar music. Discover new music this way. It's also good for skipping around when a commercial comes on on your current station."

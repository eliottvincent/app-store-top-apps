Classroom makes it easy for learners and instructors to connect—inside and outside of schools. Classroom saves time and paper, and makes it easy to create classes, distribute assignments, communicate, and stay organized.\n\nClassroom is designed to help teachers create, collect, and grade assignments paperlessly, including time-saving features like the ability to automatically make a copy of a Google Document for each student. It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organized.\n\nStudents can keep track of what’s due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and grades right in Classroom.\n\nWith the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and grade the assignment - at school or on the go. Students and teachers receive notifications when they have new content in Classroom, so they are always up to date.\n\nThere are many benefits of using Classroom:\n\nEasy to set up\nTeachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It takes just minutes to set up.\n\nSaves time\nThe simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review, and grade assignments quickly, all in one place.\n\nImproves organization\nStudents can see all of their assignments on an assignments page, and all class materials (e.g., documents, photos, and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.\n\nEnhances communication\nClassroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.\n\nSecure\nLike the rest of Google Workspace for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes.\n\nPermissions Notice:\nCamera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.\nMicrophone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.\nPhotos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom. Photos or videos posted to Classroom will be stored on Google servers in order to show them in Classroom."

From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

      "label": "Lingvist is the language learning app built by scientists and language experts that teaches vocabulary better than anyone else in the world. The depth of our courses combined with the latest research in machine learning gets you using a language with high proficiency, fast.\n\nGET LEVEL PLACED FOR FREE - TRY LINGVIST\n\nLEARN 10 LANGUAGES: English, German, French, Dutch, Italian, Brazilian Portuguese, Spanish, Latin American Spanish, Estonian and Russian.\n\n=====\n\nWHY LINGVIST?\n\nFOLLOW CONVERSATIONS QUICKLY\nLearn the vocabulary that appears most often in a language first, allowing you to accelerate your learning.\n\nREAD, WRITE, SPEAK, AND LISTEN\nPerfect your pronunciation using sophisticated speech recognition technology or type your answers. Every sentence has audio to ensure you hone your listening skills.\n\nFOR SERIOUS LEARNERS\nYour learning efficiency is our focus. Enjoy a clean UI with no advertising, no unnecessary clicks, and no distractions.\n\nREMEMBER A LANGUAGE FOREVER\nUsing scientifically proven spaced repetition methodology, the vocabulary gets fixed in your long-term memory over time. You can even see your progress on increasing the intervals in the app.\n\nLEARN GRAMMAR IN CONTEXT OR AS A FOCUS\nAcquire grammar passively (inductive learning) like a native with our bite-sized sentences, or practice conjugating French verbs in our French course.\n\nSPECIALIST VOCABULARY FOR YOU\nSubmit your own words, images, or text and Lingvist will automatically gather vocabulary related to the theme for you to learn. Whether it’s Harry Potter in German, French nuclear physics, or Spanish colors, you can learn the words most important to you (available in some courses).\n\nMOTIVATIONAL STATISTICS\nPacked with data on your learning progress, you’ll be able to chart your path to success.\n\nA MUST-HAVE TOOL IN YOUR BAG\nDo you live in your target country, use a tutor or language school, or even read books, listen to podcasts, or watch content in your target language? Lingvist works best when used in parallel with other learning methods. It’s the difference between passing your test or acing it.\n\nLEARN BY DOING\nYou will learn vocabulary or conjugations (available in some courses) by “guessing” the answer. Getting it wrong is one of the fastest ways to learn, and your brain will start to remember very quickly.\n\nHANDS FREE\nThe playlist feature lets you listen to bite-sized sentences in hands-free mode.\n\nPERSONALIZED SETTINGS\nEvery learner is different. Personalize your learning to suit you, with various settings allowing you to learn with extra slow speech, strict diacritics, and even grammar tables.\n\nPERSONALIZED LEARNING PLAN\nWe'll serve you new words that are most relevant to you. As we measure your memory curves, we ask you to repeat words at the optimal time – just before you forget them. This way, you'll always know what to learn next.\n\nLANGUAGE LEARNING MADE EASY\nWhether you are planning on spending this summer in Italy and need to learn Italian, or your next adventure is taking up a course in Germany and you need an app to learn German, we have you covered. Our language learning techniques will help you to get fluent in over 9 languages.\n\n=====\n\nSUBSCRIPTION\nYou will need a subscription in order to get access to the full learning materials for all languages we offer. Each subscription will be automatically renewed unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current payment period. When a subscription is canceled, access to the app's courses and features will expire at the end of the current payment period.\n\nVisit our blog to get tips, tricks, and interesting facts on how to learn languages:\n▸▸ Lingvist blog: https://lingvist.com/blog/\n\nFollow us to get interesting facts on how to learn languages:\n▸▸ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/theLingvist\n▸▸ Instagram: instagram.com/thelingvist/\n▸▸ Twitter: https://twitter.com/lingvist\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://lingvist.com/privacy-policy/\nTerms of Use: https://lingvist.com/tos/"

There’s a new surprise around every corner, but Let Me Speak will help you talk your way out of any situation.\n\nEverything is in modern, everyday English with a full audio voiceover by native speakers from the United States.

And with the spaced repetition, smart reminders, and clever associations, you won’t forget them. \n\n\nYou also get to practice your new vocabulary right away in conversations that recreate real-life situations. Here are some of the scenarios you’ll learn from:\n\n-   \tPassport control\n-   \tChecking in at the hotel\n-     Hailing a cab\n-   \tOrdering food in a restaurant\n-   \tVisiting a museum\n-   \tShopping at a supermarket\n-   \tPartying at a bar\n-   \tMeeting new people\n-   \tJob interview\n-   \tand more than 50 other topics\n\nPERFECT YOUR GRAMMAR\n\nSpeak correctly right from the start.\nYou’ll easily master the grammar topics thanks to interactive exercises and easy-to-understand grammar explanations.

Over 1 million bright minds saved more than 14 million ideas in their personal library so far.\n\nIt's like your social media feed, if your social media feed had things that mattered :-)\n\nKnowledge in Deepstash comes in the form of ideas, represented as little cards you can read at a glance. Ideas are short notes that condense profound thoughts into simple sentences. They could be: the best ideas from a book or article, inspiring quotes, practical tips on any topic. Each idea belongs to a topic, from #marketing to #leadership and #philosophy, which you can follow.\n\nIdeas are created by Deepstash members, called stashers. Whenever a stasher reads a book article or listens to a podcast and they find a concept, a thought or quote that is worth saving, remembering and sharing, they will add an idea about it in Deepstash.\n\nA daily source of inspiring & life changing stories and ideas. Read articles, learn skills, get productivity tips and discover life hacks. The magic of Deepstash is that everything you do builds your knowledge library: be it contributing  your own ideas or collecting idea cards from other stashers. Fuel your curiosity and get smarter daily.\n\nPERSONALIZED CONTENT & FEEDS\n\nChoose a few topics of interest (more than 4,000 topics to choose from) and then just use Deepstash at your leisure. As you read and save ideas, we learn what you like and find the best stories, articles, books, podcasts and other top content to show you every day. You don’t even have to work for it.\n\nThe more you save ideas the better we learn what articles and topics you love. We refresh your recommendations multiple times a day so you never run out of fresh ideas.\n\nBUILD AND ORGANIZE YOUR KNOWLEDGE\n\nYou can save ideas in your own profile and build your own library of facts, skills, quotes, information and ideas that matter to you and which you can use at any time.\n\nSearch and filter your ideas and organize your knowledge into personalized stashes, which are basically collections of insights stocked up and ready to go for when you need them: a Powerpoint presentation, a new job interview, a date, a project at work, or negotiating your rent with the landlord.\n\nSHARE YOUR KNOWLEDGE\n\nAdd your own ideas and stash them in your knowledge library so you always have them at hand.\n\nShare your own or other ideas you find with your friends and colleagues on Whatsapp or Facebook or send it to your followers on Twitter, Instagram, Linkedin or Quora. The Deepstash bite-sized idea format is great for this. \n\nShare a link to ideas or just an image. We built special image formats for each social network (Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and others) so your ideas will look their best.\n\nNO ADS. NO DISTRACTIONS\n\nThe Deepstash app is free and open to everyone. Get a clean reading experience and focus on the content instead of being distracted with annoying ads. Just get a quick free account (Facebook & Google login) and you’re good to go.\n\nGood for your career. \nGreat for your life. \nGive it a shot!\n\nRead more about our terms and conditions here:\nTerms of service: https://deepstash.com/terms-of-service\nPrivacy policy: https://deepstash.com/privacy-policy"

We will continue in the hopes that there will soon be peace for our children and children all around the world!\n\nDrawing Academy from Bini Games is a unique app where kids are inspired to learn by drawing. In our app, drawing gets children excited even for letters and numbers!\n\nIn preschoolers, drawing plays an important role in the development of the right side of the brain. As they draw, children process information in multiple ways, such as with their eyes and body, as well as emotionally. We created the Drawing Academy app with all this in mind.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n- 150 step-by step drawing tutorials in 10 thematic sets with different complexity levels for kids aged 2 to 6\n- “ABC\" and \"Numbers” packs to get children interested in learning letters and numbers through drawing with pictures they make themselves\n- a huge variety of tools, including pencils, crayons, stickers, patterns, and paints\n- tracing and free-drawing mechanics to help prepare your child’s hand for writing with step-by-step motor-skill refinement, from the moment they first scribble to their finalized masterpieces\n- activities that form a customized age-based learning program, taking your child’s interests into account\n- unique easy-to-follow tracing exercises that guide your child’s creativity without limitations and stimulating free drawing\n\nDrawing Academy isn’t just another coloring book!\n\nNote: only part of the content in the screenshots is available in the free version of the application. To gain access to the full version, you will need to make an in-app purchase.\n\nSubscription Details\n\nGet access to over 100 cute characters and drawings after subscribing to the Drawing Academy. Just download and go!\n\nA free 7-day trial period is available to you, or you can subscribe right after download.\n\nAfter your free trial, your subscription will automatically start unless you adjust your subscription settings at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.\n\nWe provide different subscription options for your convenience: monthly and annual subscription.\n\nIf you change your mind at any point, cancellation is easy through your iTunes settings.\n\nPayment for subscriptions will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\n\nYour subscription automatically renews unless you turn the renewal feature off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.\n\nYou will be charged for renewal within 24 hours of the end of the current period.\n\nYou can cancel your subscription anytime through your Account Settings without any cancellation fees.\n\nYou can use your subscription on any device registered with your Apple ID.\n\nIf you need help, have questions, or just want to say, “hi!”, get in touch at feedback@bini.games.\n\nhttps://binibambini.com/terms-of-use/\n\nhttp://binibambini.com/privacy\n\nMore about Bini Games:\n\nBini Games is a group of enthusiastic professionals including designers, artists, animators, programmers, and musicians, who love to create digital games for children.\n\nAll our games are safe and do not collect any personal information."

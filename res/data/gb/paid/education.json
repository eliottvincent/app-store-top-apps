      "label": "Hit the Button Math is an app designed to help develop mental math and calculation skills.\n\nThe app is aimed at 5-11 year olds. There are 166 different game modes of varying difficulty so it is useful throughout grades K-5. Answer as many questions as possible in minute-long games, or you can now practice without the pressure of a countdown timer - a feature which is new for 2019. Questions are randomly generated which means it is very replayable. The game has been carefully designed for children, with large, widely spaced buttons. We recommend that young children play on a tablet.\n\nSix main topics are covered: \n\n* Times tables - up to 10 or 12 \n* Division - up to 10 or 12\n* Square numbers\n* Number bonds\n* Doubling \n* Halving\n\nBetween these topics, the four standard arithmetic operations are covered: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.\n\nYou can create up to 30 player profiles per device to track an individual's high scores (increased from 15 in 2019). If you prefer there's also the option to play as a guest. All data is stored locally on your device so you don't have to worry about privacy issues. We've also made it very easy for children to quickly switch between profiles after playing a game, if they're sharing a device.\n\nAfter each game, the score achieved is displayed along with the child's high score. Bronze, silver or gold stars and trophies are awarded depending on the score achieved in each game."

      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

      "label": "The OFFICIAL ABRSM Aural Trainer contains interactive challenges to help develop your music aural skills (listening skills). Anyone can use it, but it is designed around ABRSM’s aural tests for Grades 1 to 5. The app can be used in any order, however often you like, on your own or with your teacher.\n\nUse ABRSM Aural Trainer to:\n\n• Improve your sense of pulse and metre (feeling the beat).\n\n• Exercise your musical memory (remember how music sounds and be able to repeat it or spot differences and mistakes).\n\n• Develop your confidence and accuracy at sight-singing (reading and singing the music you see).\n\n• Learn to describe dynamics, articulation, tempo and tonality.\n\n• Practise identifying the features in music that make-up its style and character.\n\n• Develop the skills to know when a piece of music was written.\n\nThe app covers the following ABRSM aural test content:\n• Pulse and Metre\n• Echoes\n• Differences\n• Melodic Repetition\n• Sight-singing\n• Musical Features\n• Rhythmic Repetition\n• Metre\n\nTackle each element in stages using the preparation exercises.\n\nAll exercises are fully interactive. Each one gives you the opportunity to repeat the question, or to compare your response to the correct answer and hear the music again. The app also features supporting tools including an interval trainer, progress tracker and guides to the aural tests in ABRSM graded music exams.\n\nMany exercises are automatically marked by the application. Self-review and critical listening are also key to successful development of the musical ear, which is why the app provides tools for you to review and evaluate your performance against sample responses in all cases. Your progress is logged whenever you use the app, so you can always see at a glance the areas you might want to revisit."

      "label": "Spelling Bee by Squeebles is an app aimed at helping 5 to 11 year old kids practice their spellings in a fun, motivating environment. It allows you to set up your own, personalized spelling tests, as well as download from over 150 pre-recorded tests containing over 1800 words.\n\n\"After evaluating many spelling apps, I was so pleasantly surprised while testing out Squeebles Spelling – it’s a winner!\" - TeachersWithApps.com\n\n**************************************\n\nKey Features (from a parent or teacher's perspective):\n\n- Set up your own custom spelling tests containing the exact words your kids need to learn, recording yourself speaking the audio of each word, or download from over 200 pre-recorded spelling tests created by us across 5 difficulty levels.\n\n- Dyslexia-friendly features, including the option of using Open Dyslexic font.\n\n- Accented characters allow you to set up spelling tests for French, Spanish, German or Italian words.\n\n- Individual statistics cover spelling test scores and show incorrect spellings so you can see what each child is struggling with.\n\n- Print each child's previous tests and answers.\n\n- Register unlimited children on any one device\n\n- Share spelling tests between devices or back them up to the cloud using a free KeyStageFun account.\n\n- Customize each child's experience with personalized settings.\n\n- No in-app purchases, no adverts and no internet links for children to accidentally tap on.\n\n- Parent / teacher area can be password protected.\n\n- A motivational reward system for your children keeps them practicing their spellings so they can keep earning further rewards and making progress in the game.\n\n**************************************\n\nKey Features (from a child's perspective):\n\n- Practice your spellings across 4 different game modes, taking personalized tests set by a parent or teacher, KeyStageFun downloadable tests, random tests and tricky tests.\n\n- \"Tricky Words\" mode only asks you questions you previously answered incorrectly.\n\n- Consolidate learning by taking one-off tests that choose words randomly from all the words stored in the app.\n\n- Rescue 20 Squeebles from the clutches of the nasty Spelling Snake, including some designed by children who won our \"Design a Squeeble\" competition. Each Squeeble has its own unique personality, facts and stats.\n\n- Every time you spell a word correctly, you earn turns on the fun \"Squeeberang\" mini game, where Squeebles fly as far as they can through the air on boomerang-shaped colourful flying machines.\n\n- Collect stars to trade for Squeeberangs and power-ups to use in the Squeeberang game. The more stars you have, the better the Squeeberangs you can get.\n\n- Earn power-ups to use in the game.\n\n- View high scores, stats and the rewards you've won.\n\n**************************************\n\nThe app can be used by kids practicing for a weekly spelling test or spelling bee, or those looking to improve vocabulary ahead of school end of year tests.\n\nFrom the App Store:\n\n\"Love this design!  Simple, easy to use, interactive.  I have downloaded eight different spelling apps - all four stars +.  However, this is the best one I have found for my son.\" (5 star review)\n\n\"We use this app to help my daughter study for her weekly spelling test. It is a great study tool. She gets 100% on almost all of her tests.\"\n\n\"My husband and I enjoyed recording our daughter's weekly spelling words (using silly voices, of course!). My nine year old was giggling as she learned - who knew spelling could be so fun?\"\n\n\"My daughter practices her spelling list on this every night. It works great, easy to use and set up. She loves earning points to buy squeeberangs. Way more fun than practicing on paper, and helps them find their way around the keyboard too.\"\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions for features, please e-mail info@keystagefun.co.uk"

Mnemonica, Aronoson, Sti-stebbins) \n\n‘Practice P.A.O’ \n\nOur method for learning the stack uses the unique P.A.O Method (person, action, object.) \n\nYou will be able to enter your own custom values and practice them within the app! \n\nIn order to protect the integrity of our methods we won’t go any deeper into that here, but you will be able to practice P.A.O within the app. \n\n‘Practice the Stack’\n\nThis is where you’ll spend most of your time.\n\nIn the ‘practice the stack’ part of the app there are a lot of settings you can play around with! \n\nYou can practice any part of the stack e.g. 1-10, 5-25, or 1-52 (anything you choose!) \n\nYou can also practice based on suits, odd cards, even cards, red or black cards and more! \n\nYou can also set your own rules for the training deciding whether you want to be timed, lose lives, or practice in free play mode. \n\nYour custom stacks also automatically sync with this part of the app. \n\nEach day you practice you’ll update your streak - get to thirty days and we’ll send you something special! \n\nThis app is constantly being worked on to make it the best app in the magic industry regarding stack training - you won’t be disappointed. \n\nBuy now!"

      "label": "The OFFICIAL ABRSM Aural Trainer contains interactive challenges to help develop your music aural skills (listening skills). Anyone can use it, but it is designed around ABRSM’s aural tests for Grades 6 to 8. The app can be used in any order, however often you like, on your own or with your teacher. \n\nUse ABRSM Aural Trainer to:\n• Exercise your musical memory (remember how music sounds and be able to repeat it).\n• Develop your confidence and accuracy at sight-singing (reading and singing the music you see).\n• Improve your recognition of cadences, chords and modulations. \n• Learn to describe texture, structure, dynamics, articulation, tempo and tonality.\n• Practise identifying the features in music that make-up its style and character.\n• Develop the skills to know when a piece of music was written.\n\nThe app covers the following ABRSM aural test content:\n• Melodic Repetition\n• Sight-singing\n• Cadences\n• Chords\n• Modulations\n• Musical Features\n• Rhythmic Repetition\n• Metre\n\nAll exercises are fully interactive. Each one gives you the opportunity to repeat the question, or to compare your response to the correct answer and hear the music again . The app also features supporting tools including a cadence trainer, progress tracker and guides to the aural tests in ABRSM graded music exams.\n\nMany exercises are automatically marked by the application. Self-review and critical listening are also key to successful development of the musical ear, which is why the app provides tools for you to review and evaluate your performance against sample responses in all cases. Your progress is logged whenever you use the app, so you can always see at a glance the areas you might want to revisit."

      "label": "The Baby Sensory Signbook app teaches you all signs you need, so you and your baby can start communication and language development. Learn to communicate long before the development of speech, using our simple Babysigns.\n\n\nFEATURES \n- All official Baby Sensory baby signs right in your pocket.\n- Find a sign in 3 simple steps with the easy interface.\n- Make a list of favourites, for the signs you're learning.\n- Learn 'Say Hello' and 4 other songs' signs with music.\n- Looping videos, so you can easily see how it’s done.\n- Slow down the video, to better view the hand shapes.\n\n\nABOUT THE APP\nWith the Baby Sensory app, you can easily learn all official signs to make early communication possible. This creates a stronger parent-child bond and stimulates early language development.\nEven the youngest baby wants to tell you what they need and how they feel. But they’re unable to express themselves verbally and may cry if their needs are not met. Signing helps your baby to express his or her needs and takes the guesswork out of parenting.\n\n\nABOUT US\nBaby Sensory was the first baby programme to offer a complete approach to learning and development from birth to 13 months. Designed to stimulate, educate and provide precious memories during the all-important first years of life, the programme has won multiple awards both nationally and internationally since 2008. Everything we do is backed by over 35 years of expert research in childhood development. \n\n\n\nIf you have any questions regarding the app, please let us know. Send us a message or see www.babysensory.com for more info.\n\n\nCONTACT\nWebsite: www.babysensory.com\nMail: apps@babysensory.com\n\n\n\nWe are super excited to hear what you think of our little app!\nSend your thoughts and tips to: apps@babysensory.com\n\nLike and follow us to stay up to date on future updates:\nwww.facebook.com/BabySensoryUK\nwww.twitter.com/BabySensoryHQ"

      "label": "Over the past few years, the Scottish Curriculum underwent a major change. One of those changes was the introduction of the Curriculum for Excellence. This has normally been accessed through a Word or PDF document or through a folder located in the classroom. The Curriculum for Excellence App makes accessing the Curriculum for Excellence Experiences and Outcomes easier for Staff, parents and pupils directly on their devices.\n\nThe use of this App will allow those interested in accessing the Scottish 3-18 Curriculum with ease. Content has been assembled from the Education Scotland Website and once installed requires no access to the internet to be used.\n\nAs a Teacher myself, I found it difficult to access the information readily in a meeting or general discussion while in school or away at a training day. Either I had to lug about the Experiences and Outcomes folder all the time or be left without it at critical moments in meetings and discussions.\n\nEqually, while planning and trying to match up cross-curricular themes, the folder made the task more difficult due to the size of it. When a meeting was scheduled, Experiences and Outcomes were printed so everyone had a copy for the discussion. I set about creating something we could all access and use, while at the same time reducing unnecessary printing and additional costs.\n\nThe Curriculum for Excellence app will sit quietly in your phone and should you require to access an E and O at a point in a meeting, or check its relation during an in-service day or educational talk, then this will make it easier to stay focused on what is being discussed and not be thinking about where your folder is or what page you need to turn to.\n\nPlease come back and rate this app once you have used it. I know it seems so petty, but this helps other teachers, interested bodies, parents and pupils find it and use it. Even a small like will help out a great deal.\n\nI have tried my best to make the Curriculum for Excellence app as simple to access as possible and for it to be accessible to as many IOS devices I am able, knowing that technology is moving faster than we are able to purchase gadgets and tech. With that in mind, if you have a suggestion, concern or complaint, please get in touch and let me know so I can try to develop it, fix it or address it.\n\nThank you for your support.\n\n(The developer has no affiliation with Education Scotland.)"

      "label": "With Toca Kitchen Sushi, you’re the chef of a busy seaside restaurant. Customers come in, and you decide what they’re going to eat. Feel like slicing up squid, asparagus, and candy canes, and rolling it all up into a cone of seaweed? Go right ahead. Want to make stars and hearts of watermelon and mix them with fish and hot peppers? Make the roundest rice ball? You’ve got great tools for that right at your fingertips. With a fantastic array of ingredients, condiments, tools, serving dishes and some hidden surprises, you’re set for some serious play. \n\nOnce you’re finished cooking up something unexpected for your customers—it could even be totally gross if you want—sit back and see how they react. That might be the most surprising thing of all!\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Greet your customers, then head to the fridge to see all your fresh ingredients. Choose from rice, tuna, avocado, asparagus, squid, salmon, pepper, salami, radish, candy canes (no joke!), ginger, potato, tofu, shrimp and many, many more. If you’d rather stick to just veggies, switch to the vegan setting!\n\n- The shape machine is 1,000 light years ahead of a plain old rice cooker. Using the control panel, you can form any ingredient into different shapes, like an oval, square, or even a flower!\n\n- The rolling mat is where everything comes together. Whether it’s a sheet of seaweed, tofu or lettuce, you can roll up your ingredients into sushi, funky cones, giant burritos, you name it.\n\n- Want your food a bit well-done? Crank up the temperature on the frying pan and see what happens. \n\n- Hit the cutting board to slice up your ingredients or your sushi rolls. Your blade is masterful—it can cut through anything, like a huge fish or hard salami!\n\n- Once you’ve prepared your meal, it needs the perfect plate. Get artistic about it, arrange the food in perfect patterns, or make a huge, messy pile; even decorate with funny stickers. Do something extra and you may get a big reaction from your customers!\n\n- The dining counter is where your customers finally get to see your culinary creation, grab their chopsticks and dig in. Will their eyes brighten in delight, or will they make a grossed-out face?\n\nSo, what will you serve today?\n\n\nAbout Us:\nToca Boca creates digital toys and other playful products for kids around the world.

Children will love learning their letter sounds by singing along to the Jolly Songs and doing the actions. Being able to identify the letter sounds in words will help them with both their reading and writing. This app will entertain the whole family or school classroom.\n\n• Easily switch between British or American English and Precursive or Print letter fonts.\n\n• There's a highlighter option to track each word as it is sung, helping the child to read. This can also be switched off.\n\n• Autoplay option available from the info page\n\n• Includes the vowels song.\n\n• Includes a description and an image for each of the Jolly Phonics actions.\n\n• Easy to use navigation to quickly find the song you want to play.\n\n• With beautiful illustrations from our Jolly Songs book.\n\n• Includes an index of all the songs.\n\n\nFor customers experiencing problems with sound first check that the side switch is not activated (you should not see a red dot on the switch). Then ensure the volume is turned up. Now open the app. If you still hear no sound at this point, swipe up from the very bottom of your screen and when you see the arrow swipe up again to pull up the on-screen menu pages. Ensure you are on the first menu page and if you see a red button with a bell and a line through it this is means your ringer is set to mute and is why you cannot hear any sound in our app. Simply touch the button to turn the sound back on. Now swipe down on the menu to return to the app and you should now hear sound when you play a song.

      "label": "Squeebles Multiplication is a fun, interactive way for your children to learn and practice their multiplication tables and improve their basic math skills. \n\nThe app features seven different game modes and a training area that teaches as well as tests, along with a reward system that appeals to children where they rescue Squeebles characters from the nasty Math Monster and earn turns on a fun mini game. A parent / teacher area lets you stay in touch with your children's progress and customize their learning experience.\n\n\"Finally - a just right app to help kids master math facts with serious motivation and tons of fun!\" - TeachersWithApps.com\n\n**************************************\n\nKey Features (from a child's perspective):\n\n- Practice your multiplication facts across 7 different game modes (Times Tables 1-12; Tricky Tables; Mix It Up; Fill in the Gap; Challenge Mode; Extreme Tables; Word Problems). \n- Covers multiplication tables from the regular 1 to 12 sets through to the 13s, 14s and 15s for those who want a further challenge.\n- Step by Step Training mode takes you through your multiplication tables one by one until you know them all.\n- 40 Squeebles characters to rescue by answering questions correctly, each with its own unique personality. \n- 50 gemstones to win for reaching certain milestones. \n- Earn turns on the fun mini-game, Bubble-Ball, by answering multiplication questions correctly. A second mini game is included in the Step by Step training mode as a \"Brain Break\" every so often.\n- Earn stars to swap for equipment to use in the Bubble-Ball game. \n- Win special random bonus rewards when you're least expecting it. \n\nKey Features (from a parent or teacher's perspective):\n\n- Password-protected parents/teacher zone lets you manage players and view progress. \n- View full stats from the last 28 days for each child. \n- Stats show each table attempted and any incorrect answers so each child's progress can be carefully monitored. \n- Register unlimited children with the app, making it perfect for classroom use as well as home use. \n- Lock multiplication sets or particular questions so children are only asked questions which are suitable for their ability level. This also stops children from earning unlimited rewards by answering questions they find very easy.\n- View a list of 'Tricky Multiplication Tables' for each child (questions they have previously got wrong).\n- Edit player settings, allowing customization for each child. \n- Switch between user-entry or multiple choice answer modes for children of different ages or ability levels. \n- No in-app purchases, adverts or internet links of any kind.\n\n**************************************\n\nThe app can be used by kids practicing for a weekly multiplication test, or those looking to improve multiplication and core math skills in general.\n\nFrom the App Store:\n\n\"Simply put: best multiplication app we’ve tried. The games require you to do math; tricky tables is a great way to work through mistakes; you can adjust settings for the math- and timer-anxious child. Really excellent design.\"\n\n\"My son liked saving/collecting the squeebles and reading their style/strengths the way he does Pokemon cards. And he learned all his times tables thru 12 in two sessions after struggling for weeks.\"\n\n\"I decided to purchase this for our 6 children to help them learn the times tables in a fun way.  It is a great app: they all enjoy it, it is easy to use, and best of all, they are learning their tables.\"\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions for features, please e-mail info@keystagefun.co.uk"

Now, some of that PhonicsPlay fun is available in an app. Alien brothers Obb and Bob guide children through an ongoing sequence of mini-games that rehearse key skills from Phase 2 of the Letters and Sounds programme that is used widely in UK schools.\r\n\r\nThe app is simple to navigate. Children can play independently and can continue playing as long as they like without the game coming to an end. Alternatively, for any parents feeling a bit bemused about phonics and how it is taught these days, this app is a great opportunity for playing and learning together.\r\n\r\nThis app is for children in the early stages of learning phonics and covers: s, a, t, p, i, n, m, d, g, o, c, k, ck, e, u, r, h, b, f, l.  \r\n\r\nThis app isn't designed to teach phonics - human beings will always do that job best. Instead it was designed to be a simple and enjoyable way for children to rehearse and build on what they have already learned.  As with any new skill, the more you rehearse it, the more automatic it becomes.  \r\n\r\nThere is no in-app purchasing in this game.\r\n\r\nFor further information or to find out more about how the app can support phonics learning, please visit: www.phonicsplayapps.co.uk\r\n2,"

Monster Phonics has also been selected by BETT futures as one of the top 20 most inspiring new ed-tech ideas in the UK. This app supports the reading and spelling of the first 100 high frequency words and is part of a wider phonics scheme that supports the New Curriculum for Spelling (KS1) and phonics in Reception.\n\nMonster Phonics is a synthetic phonics scheme. It is unique in that it uses character (monster) phoneme cues and colour coding to represent the sounds A, E, I, O, U, oo, ow, silent letters and tricky letters. Each monster and its corresponding colour is linked to a specific set of graphemes that makes the particular phoneme.\n\nMonster Phonics Apps have been developed specifically to make phonics more accessible for all learners. The revolutionary use of colour coding and characterisation has been proven to dramatically accelerate progress in reading. Monster Phonics also teaches handwriting and the correct letter formation for the first 100 words.\n\nThis Monster Phonics APP show how the first 100 words are more accessible to children because of the use of colour. The number of “tricky” words is reduced considerably with the colour coding system. There will be 2 Monster Phonics APPs covering the first 300 words. Once learned these words stay with children forever. The first 300 words make up 65% of all reading texts. Learning these words quickly is incredibly important for all children.\n\nSelected to be in the BETT Futures Cohort - January 2015!"

Yet hand drawing these cyclohexane chair forms can be tricky.\n\nWe created this game to prove organic chemistry can be visual, tactile and, yes, entertaining. \n\nThis visual pattern puzzle game provides a fun and fast method for mastering chair (or cyclohexane) ring flips. \n\nChairs! takes the mystery out of ring flips by offering instant feedback. During game play, as levels increase, so too does the complexity of these organic chemistry puzzles against the clock. There's no need to understand organic chemistry to play.\n\nWith over 13 challenging levels, we will help you master this tough concept with ease.\n\nRecommended by professors at the University of Minnesota, University of Michigan, University of Edinburgh, and others.\n\nAwards\nSXSW LaunchEDU Finalist, 2016\nDigital Innovation in Learning Award, 2015\nMilken-Penn GSE Education Business Plan Competition Finalist 2017\nReimagine EDU Shortlist 2015, 2016\nChairs! named top mobile app by Royal Society of Chemistry"

Try playing with it!\n\nAs you keep playing, the sums get gradually harder and the Numberblocks try out new number shapes. This helps children get better at recognising amounts on sight. If a Numberblock looks unfamiliar, try counting their blocks!\n\nKeep going to fill the park with playthings. After discovering all 20, you can restart the game and play again. Repeat play is a great way to get better at your number bonds and predicting which Numberblocks you will make."

      "label": "Winner of the 2018 Children's BAFTA for best Interactive\n\n* As seen on Nick Jr.*\n\nNumbers made fun, with Hey Duggee’s first educational app: The Counting Badge. \n\nSafe ad-free content for your little ones. \n\nThe Counting Badge has been designed with Early Years Foundation Stage learning outcomes at its core. Featuring a diverse mix of engaging counting tasks, with automatically adjusting difficulty levels, the game caters for Duggee fans of all ages. \n\nStart by remembering which day of the week it is and picking what the weather looks like outside -   then move swiftly on to some Early Years brain training! There are nine counting tasks to practice, each with four variations. That's 36 different activities to keep content fresh, while three levels of difficulty ensure that little minds will stay entertained and engaged for longer.\n\n• Tap tadpoles one-by-one, counting up as you go. Keep practising with bubbles, apples and ducks. \n• Pick which of the two groups of spiders matches the number shown on screen. Have another go with the frogs, worms or snails.\n• Count bees as you catch them and place them back in their hive. You'll also need to round up the cows, the chickens and the crows. \n• Put the snakes in order, from smallest to biggest. Practice makes perfect, so keep trying with some socks, totem poles and test tubes.\n• Sort the toucans from the flamingos by placing them in the correct paddling pool. There's plenty more sorting to do with bugs, pizza toppings and clubhouse toys. \n• Count the alligators every time they raise their heads above the water. See if you can perfect your reaction times with rabbits, monkeys and mice. \n• Decide whether there are more tulips or daisies in the field of flowers. Keep working out ‘which is more,’ with bugs, balloons and Jazz Fish.\n• Identify the number that shows how many ants are holding up the hotdog. You'll also need to choose the correct number of penguins, rabbits and birds.\n• And finally, as an early introduction to adding up, work out how many penguins are missing from the iceberg. You’ll need to do some more sums by deciding on the missing number of sandwiches, bananas and birds.\n\nPlaying through five activities will earn the player a Gold Star and every fourth star will see Duggee award them their Counting Badge. Profiles for up to three players can be saved, allowing your little ones to pick up exactly where they left off each time they return to the app. \n\nSo what are you waiting for? Let’s get counting!\n\nKey Features: \n• Counting tasks chosen based on Early Years numeracy learning objectives\n• Designed to cover the varying abilities of the 2 to 6 year old range. \n• Encourages player recognition of days of the week, dates in the month and the weather outside. \n• 36 counting screens keep content fresh and maximise the duration of engagement (9x mechanics each with 4x variations) \n• Stored player profiles regulate difficulty progression for each counting mechanic (3x difficulty levels)\n• Gold star collection mechanic plus daily award of the Counting Badge encourages repeat plays\n\nCustomer Care:\nIf you experience any technical issues with this app please get in touch.

      "label": "The ABRSM Violin Scales Trainer is your all-in-one companion for practising scales.  The app covers all scales requirements at ABRSM Grades 1-5 from the current Violin syllabus and is also suitable for Initial Grade within Grade 1!\n\nWhat does ABRSM Violin Scales Trainer include?\nAn extensive set of resources to help you practise your scales and learn the requirements for your Practical Grades and enhance your performance:\n\nPractice Area\n• Notation for every scale, including suggested fingering and positioning. \n• Example performances of every scale, for you to compare your own playing against.\n• A built-in metronome to help you see how close you are to exam tempo. Start slow and gradually build up the speed!\n• A unique backing track for every scale. \n\nTest Area\nIf you fancy a quick warm-up or to put yourself to the test, then the Test Area is for you! This area selects a series of scales from the requirements for you to perform. Use the record function, reflect critically and rate your performance.\n \nPractice Meter\nThe more you use Violin Scales Trainer, the smarter it gets. The Practice Meter lets you see at a glance which scales you’re doing well at, and which ones need more practice.\n\nWhy Practise Scales?\nTime devoted to these exercises within each practice session will improve many aspects of technique, such as co-ordination, string crossing, bow control, position changes and tone production. In addition, the sense of key and pattern acquired through familiarity with scales and arpeggios has several benefits: it speeds up the learning of new pieces, builds aural awareness, increases familiarity with the geography of the instrument, and helps develop fine intonation, evenness of line and quality of tone."

It is great in the way that she wants to play the game and laughs at all the videos that goes with the sounds. In addition to her reading struggles she also has problems with writing and she is asked to follow the path to make the letters correctly as well. She doesn't seem to realize that she is learning and playing at the same time. She is already asking if there is a hairy phonics 3 as well.\n\n\nMy son loves it and had really helped him with his phonics."

If you have a chance to walk the Track, you will not be disappointed!\n\nThe App has beautiful photographs, extremely detailed information, built-in maps and GPS support. So you cannot get lost and will not miss anything.\n\nNO INTERNET OR MOBILE COVERAGE IS NEEDED to use this guide. This is very important because most of the track has no internet or mobile coverage. The excellent maps work without using any data, WiFi connection, or internet. So it's fast and won't cost you money. \n\nIt's very interactive; turn on your phone or tablet's GPS from within the App, then follow the track and you will never get lost again! Also see exactly where to park to take shorter day hikes, where to get water and food, and where the best sights, beaches and attractions are. Note that GPS works everywhere - you don't need mobile network reception for it to work.\n\nEach map is marked up to show you viewpoints, attractions, toilets, places to get water, the best beaches, where to camp and more. Tap any map marker to show much more information about that place.\n\nIt's like having your own personal tour guide in your pocket that is showing you exactly where to turn at those unmarked crossroads, and it can be quickly referenced to show you the name of the beach or town you are on or in. It is easier than using a paper guide book or a paper map and compass because you can instantly see where you are.\n\nWe suggest which way you should walk the track and give you the distances between campsites or paid (comfy!) accommodation to help you in planning your hike. \n\nFEATURES:\n- We describe beaches, sights, camping, accommodation and more\n- We give you lots of useful General Information to help you make your hike enjoyable and safe\n- We include a number of useful first-aid tips for the most common issues you may encounter on the Track\n- The guide has loads of beautiful photographs of the Track to inspire you!\n- It has detailed maps of hiking trails. With the phone's GPS enabled you cannot get lost!\n- It works without the internet. So there are no data roaming charges. And mobile black spots will not stop the App from working (unlike websites and most other Apps)\n- It uses very high-resolution maps\n- It describes several other hiking tracks and day walks nearby the Cape to Cape track.\n- All information has been researched and written by a local of the Margaret River region\n- Information is presented relative to your current location, so its very easy to find where you are and how far it is to your next camping area or town for that cold beer or chilled glass of white wine\n- Has a useful search feature. For example, search for \"shower\" to list everything in the App that uses that text\n- Quick reference entries show you all of the water sources and the locations of toilets along the track. Activate the GPS to show you how far to your next one\n- The guide is simple to use\n- This App automatically keeps it's content up to date by periodically downloading updates from \"the cloud\". You don't have to do anything to make this happen."

This NEW improved, paid version will help create more technology projects for the people of Chepstow and the surrounding areas.\nMore features are on their way for Enviroute, and we'll be adding surrounding roads / routes such as the M49 along with routes into Bristol, the M5, and more.\nIf you don't know about the original problems commuters have experienced with the Severn crossings, read on for some background...\nThe Severn bridges based between England and wales are major connections for the M4 and M48 motorways. Traditionally both crossings / bridges have been owned and operated by private companies.\n\n“Is the bridge open” and Enviroute have created an app that allows local residents and commuters to check the status of both bridges in order to plan their routes more effectively. From time to time the bridges are closed due to maintenance and/or adverse weather conditions and, since the ownership of the Severn bridges has changed there has been a lack of reliable communications around the status of the M48 Severn bridge and the M4 Severn Bridge.\n\n“Is the bridge open” is here to help with this and to provide information on when either of the Severn Bridges are closed or partially closed.\nSevern bridge updates at the touch of a button instead of endless maps, websites or twitter accounts. \nFind out instantly is the Severn Bridge is open and get updates sent directly to your device (Enviroute NEW now has this feature!) before you set off on your journey.\nBy paying for Enviroute NEW you are indirectly funding this local area for more exciting tech based projects.  We want to make life easier for residents of the surrounding areas, help local businesses sell more, save your local high-streets plus many more projects in the pipeline.  These will be funded by the money earned by Enviroute NEW\nThank you and I hope you enjoy the new version."

With your trusty Vegan Passport, you can be sure of finding vegan food in restaurants around the globe.\n\nThis multilingual vegan guide is a must-have for globetrotting vegans. It’s small enough to slip into your pocket, but big enough to include the languages of over 96% of the world’s population.\n\nThe fifth edition of this essential guide has been updated and expanded, and now boasts 78 languages including Hausa, Igbo, Xhosa and Zulu.\n\nIncluding fail-safe pictures, which can be used when words don’t work, the Vegan Passport has all situations covered. This will ensure that you have no problem explaining what you do and don’t eat, no matter where you are in the world.\n\nWhen visiting a restaurant, show your waiter the relevant entry from this app, and ask them to read it.  Do not attempt to pronounce the text yourself!  If you are invited to a private home for a meal, show your host the relevant entry well in advance.  \n\nIf booking a hotel by post or email, send a copy of the relevant page.  Please note that several languages may be used in the place you are visiting, so you may be able to offer the reader a choice of languages.  \n\nIf all else fails then you can show them the images depicting what a vegan eats and what a vegan does not eat.\n\nWhen booking flights then you can refer to the below airplane meal code to request a vegan meal when booking.\n\nThe Vegan Society is a registered charity and the oldest vegan society in the world, founded on 1 November 1944, in the UK by Donald Watson.\n\nWhat do we want? Simple: a world where humans do not exploit non-human animals. A world where animals are free to exist in their own right. We promote a lifestyle that excludes, as far as possible and practical, all forms of exploitation of - and cruelty to - animals for the purposes of food, clothing or anything else.\n\nWe also want a just world for humans. A world where resources are utilised in a sustainable way to ensure all current and future generations are provided for - a world where no one goes hungry. At the heart of the sustainability and food justice agenda is plant-based food production and consumption: veganism."

      "label": "Ever been stood at a Bus Stop wondering when the next bus is? Or sat at home / in the pub wondering if you need to set off yet? There are a couple of way to do this if you are in Yorkshire, but none are specifically aimed at the iPhone.\n\n1.Text the 8 digit bus stop number to 63876 (A text message is charged at your standard outbound rate plus a maximum of 12p for the returned text.) \n\n2.Use the \"YourNextBus Service\" at  http://www.wymetro.com/yournextbus/search/ in Mobile Safari (What a hassle to navigate and remember all your stop numbers)\n\nNow you can have a dedicated app which will store your favourite Bus Stop numbers and present the results in an iPhone / iPad friendly format. With lots of useful features some of which are not available on the web …\n\n• Where available get the REAL arrival time of the busses, not timetabled times, but the actual time the bus is due at your chosen stop via the GPS tracker on the bus.\n• Check future arrival times by using the +1hr/-1hr buttons to move an hour or more along the schedules. \n• Store a list of \"Favourite Stops\" and organise them in Alphabetical order or simply order / rename them as you like.\n• Busses with a Live Feed will have their times highlighted in green and show how many minutes until they are due.\n• Busses with a Low Floor access for pushchairs and prams are indicated by a blue wheelchair icon on the end of the result.\n• You can tap on results to be alerted at your specified number of minutes before the bus is due, so you know when to set off.\n• Set an Auto-Refresh time to regularly reload the timetable data (Double Tap at the top of the timetable to enable).\n• The app will offer to fall back to SMS if you don't have a Data Connection on your phone.\n• Optional Shake to refresh and pull down on the results to refresh times.\n• Search for Busses / Stops by Postcode, Bus Number, or search for other bus stops near your current stop.\n• Use your phone's GPS to show a map of all the bus stops around you. \n• Our app uses the \"text-only\" version of the YourNextBus page and doesn't download images etc, this makes its very quick and saves on your data usage.\n• Large Text view for Sight Impaired users of iPads (enabled in the settings).\n\nIMPORTANT - Before purchasing we suggest you use the West Yorkshire Public Transport site linked above to make sure you can see information on the busses and stops you require. We can only provide the same information, so if you cannot find relevant information on their websites, our app will not be able to magically provide it. \n\nWe have thoroughly tested in Leeds, Wakefield, Sheffield, Harrogate, Doncaster, Scarborough and York but please ensure your area is covered before purchase.\n\nPlease don't shoot the messenger by leaving negative reviews regarding the actual Bus Times data we display, this is from the WYPTE website and we can only show the data they offer. If the times are wrong, or the bus doesn’t turn up, then the problem is with their data or services and not our wonderful app! :)\n\n\nIf you have any suggestions or in the unlikely event of a problem please contact us via the Icons on the Service Status tab (Email, Twitter, Facebook, WWW). We cannot reply to comments left in the ratings on here, but we can assure you that you will receive a swift personal reply to any comments you send us via the Application.\n\n\n\n\n\nTimetable information provided by West Yorkshire Public Transport Executive (WYPTE).\nNote: Neither this application or its author is associated with or endorsed by WYPTE."

      "label": "The Three Peaks of Pen-y-ghent, Ingleborough and Whernside are among the best-known in the Yorkshire Dales National Park. Every year thousands come to reach the top of at least one or to conquer all three in one go. \n\n\r\nThe app contains route details for the classic 24-mile circular walk, route maps for the individual peaks, Whernside, Pen-y-ghent and Ingleborough and four other shorter walks in the Three Peaks area. Don’t just come for the day, come for the stay and explore more of this spectacular area and its scenery.  \n\n\r\nThis GPS enabled app provides reassurance as you follow the arrow along your chosen route. It will also show you how far you are around the route. \n\n\r\nThis app has been developed alongside our National Park Yorkshire Three Peaks Rangers who have added points of interest along the routes for you. \n\n\r\nThe app also includes important safety advice and the code of conduct, which will help  you stay safe on the walks and help protect our  local communities. \n\n\r\nThe app is not a mapping tool. You must take other forms of navigation with you and know how to use them. We recommend you have an OS Explorer OL2 Yorkshire Dales (Southern and Western) map with you. \n\n\r\nUsing GPS tracking uses more of your battery than normal – do not rely solely on this app when walking.  \n\n\r\nAlways be prepared, conditions can change rapidly in an upland area such as the Three Peaks. \n\n\r\nYou must read the safety information contained in this app before using the route information.  \n  \r\nThe Yorkshire Three Peaks are very fragile environments, and the public rights of way network is under pressure from the hundreds of thousands of visitors that come to enjoy it each year. Maintaining the paths in the Yorkshire Three Peaks area costs on average £35 per metre. \n\n\r\n\r\nThe proceeds of this app all go towards helping the Yorkshire Dales National Park with this work. \n\n\r\n\r\nContains OS data © Crown copyright and database right 2020.\r\n\r\nContains OpenStreetMap Data © OpenStreetMap contributors.\n\r\nhttps://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright \n\n\r\n\r\nThis walking app was developed for the Yorkshire Dales National Park Authority by the team at Local Walks - www.localwalks.co.uk \n\n\r\n\r\nApp terms and conditions:\r\nhttps://www.yorkshiredales.org.uk/apptermsandconditions"

It has the first trains, the last trains and all the trains in between!\n\nJust choose your departure station and you’ll immediately see the last three trains of the day from that station. But it’s just as easy to check the first trains of the day, or the time of the next scheduled train. Choose a train and you’ll see all the stations it stops at and how long the journey will take. You can even check to see if you’ll have time to interchange with another line at one of the stops.\n\nTube Times does not need internet access, all the data is built-in, so it works fine underground or on an iPod touch. It contains data for all the Tube lines and the DLR, but does not currently include the London Overground.\n\nIMPORTANT: Tube Times does not display any live train time information. Its timetable is based on data published by Transport for London, and actual train times will be affected by line closures, engineering work and other delays, so check before you travel.\n\nPlease get in touch if you have any questions or feedback: support@tubetimesapp.com or @tubetimes on Twitter."

Follow it as it proceeds among the other traffic. Just tap the small blue dot to exit follow mode and return to the main map.\n\nMultiple Filters\nJust want to see aircraft below 10'000 feet, Boeing 747s or only planes from a certain airline? You can filter by altitude, type, callsign or registration. Filters can be combined, too.\n\nCustomizability\nCustomize the display using many options. You only want to see helicopters and hide all small airports? You can do that and much more...\n\nComplications Support\nWith many different complications available, designed to fit into all color schemes, PlaneWatcher is always just a tap away.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.planewatcher.app/privacy.html\nTerms of Use: https://www.planewatcher.app/terms.html"

No Login. \n\nNow in their 11th year as a mobile app, and their 13th online, the Wise Pilgrim Guides are the go-to source of up-to-date information on the Camino de Santiago.\n\nThe app is updated regularly with new content and new features and offers you the ability to leave tips for pilgrims following behind you.\n\nThis guide covers the Camino Francés, the most popular route across Spain. It has been redesigned and now works almost exclusively offline (to share your comments with others will require a data connection).  As more an more albergues share their WiFi this becomes less of an issue, and the guide will tell you which ones offer WiFi.\n\nAccommodation Directory:  \nA full directory of Albergues, camping, hotels, pensions, paradors, and cases rurales.  Over 900 in total, with special attention to those that can be booked online.\n\nStageless Guide:\nNo more \"stage anxiety\" or guide created bottlenecks.\n\nMaps:  \nOffline and online versions of a beautiful topographical may will give you a good view of the terrain ahead.\n\nPhotos: \nPhotos of albergues, monuments and other points of interest along the way.  Currently 900+ images and growing.\n\nScrollable Elevation Map:  \nThis one is hard to show with just a screenshot, but the elevation that appears at the top of every city page scrolls East to West.  One complete elevation, from St. Jean Pied de Port to Santiago, uninterrupted by page folds.\n\nComments:  \nAlbergue closed early for the season?  Have a restaurant that you want to share, or perhaps one to warn others about?  Every location in the app gives you the opportunity to leave a comment and to read the comments left by others. No registration necessary.\n\n¡Buen Camino and thank you for your support!"

Send den klargjorte SMS til 1415.\n2. Du modtager en bekræftelses-SMS (det er IKKE en billet). Bekræft købet ved at følge proceduren beskrevet i den modtaget SMS. Bekræfter du ikke SMS’en inden for 1 minut, annulleres bestillingen.\n3. Du modtager derefter din SMS-billet. Billetten er gældende fra du modtager den.\n\nOm startzone, stationsnavn og stoppestedsnummer:\nDu kan se din startzone og antal zoner, som du skal bruge på billetautomater og busstoppesteder. Stoppestedsnummer finder du på køreplanerne på stoppestederne – det er nummeret, i nederste højre hjørne (Husk at foran stoppestedsnummer, skal der altid skrives et S, f.eks. S552).\n\nDu kan læse mere angående billetgyldighed, priser m.m. på: www.1415.dk\n\nBemærk: \n1) App'en udfører ingen transaktioner. Betaling foregår fuldstændig på samme måde som hvis du skriver bestillings SMS'en selv.\n2) Vi har ingen forhold til 1415.dk. Ihvertfald ikke andet end at vi også benytter deres services.\n\nVi vil bestræbe os at komme med opdateringer til denne app snart, hvor der tilføjes ekstra funktioner.\n\nDu kan besøge vores hjemmeside på www.facebook.com/smsbillet.\n\nRis og ros, samt forslag til forbedringer modtages gerne via www.facebook.com/smsbillet eller biloinc@gmail.com."

Displays platform information where available. Automatically loads train times from your nearest station or loads train times from a station that you select from the stations screen. Filter train times by destination station to quickly find the timetable and live real-time train time information that you’re looking for.\n\nFuturistic high tech features\n\nWidgets - requires iOS 14 or higher\n\nEasily see train times, cancellations, rail incidents and service status on your homescreen.\n\nIncidents\n\nEasily see information about the service status and news about rail incidents and current / future planned maintenance. The incidents screen includes information such as the incident details, routes affected, date/s of incident and direct links to the relevent National Rail Enquiries page and map, where available.\n\nAR (augmented reality) mode - requires iOS 13 or higher\n\nPicture real-time train information in an interactive real-world environment. See nearby trains and railway stations in an immersive augmented reality experience. The app will locate trains that are departing from your nearest station and display them. Tapping on a train reveals more information about its calling points and last reported location. AR mode is available on iOS 13 or higher.\n\nTrain Tracker\n\nUsing it’s advanced geo-location capabilities, combined with real-time train data and it’s UK rail network map, the app predicts the estimated, interpolated location of trains at any given time. The estimated train location is displayed on a map, with information about whether the service is currently running early, on-time or late.\n\nHigh precision information\n\nThe app can report times from intermediary passing points such as junctions, providing you with a high level of precision and accuracy about the current status of a given train’s journey. Packed with detailed train information like number of carriages, train category, power type (eg Electric Multiple Unit), timing load (eg Class 323), planned maximum speed (eg 90mph max), seating classes, reservations, catering, and operating characteristics (eg Driver Only Operation). Please note that this information is only available if this data has been supplied by the Train Operating Company. Some TOCs do not supply carriage data.\n\nCustomer Feedback\n\n\"Thanks to the JUST bought @TrainBeacon app, light bags and running legs trained with @LondonCityAC - just swapped trains at READING, with 2 minutes crossover time. All makes for a GREAT #SundayMorning! #Staycation adventure to #Cornwall” - James Moyse - Journalist at Sky News\n\n\"@TrainBeacon who’s behind this app?? You’ve satisfied my nerdy needs and I am so impressed as to how slick it is. Well done”\n\n\"love the AR mode\"\n\nSafety Information\n\nNot for use in safety critical applications, level crossings, etc. Train position is estimated from latest available timing point data and may be incorrect. Care must be taken during use. Other trains may be present that are not indicated in the AR or train tracker mode of the app such as trains not stopping at the nearest station and also freight trains. Freight and non passenger trains are not displayed in the app. For your safety do not use your phone while you walk and take extreme care using the app near trains and railways.\n\nHardware requirements\n\n* AR mode and the augmented reality features of the app require iOS 13 or higher, and an iPhone 6S, SE or later device, or an iPad 2017 or later. Widgets require iOS 14 or higher *\n\nApp powered by National Rail Enquiries and contains information of Network Rail Infrastructure Ltd"

      "label": "Pasinaudoję šia programėle Jūs sužinosite daugybę naujų ir įkvepiančių istorijų apie Lietuvos Didžiąją kunigaikštystę, Trakų miestą su pilimis, kuriose įsikūręs Trakų istorijos muziejus! Išradingas ir sumanus gidas Jus lydės visos kelionės laiku metu, nuspės klausimus, suteikdamas žinių bei dar labiau pažadins smalsumą, kviesdamas apsilankyti dar kartą.\r\nGal nustebsite sužinoję, kad viduramžiais su Trakų vardu buvo siejamos trys pilys? Visos buvo mūrinės, visos apsuptos vandens – natūralių telkinių ir dirbtinai suformuotų perkasų. Dabar jas vadiname Senųjų Trakų, Trakų Pusiasalio ir Trakų Salos pilimis.\r\nPažintis prasideda trečiojoje, garsiausioje ir geriausiai išlikusioje – gotikinėje Salos pilyje. Pilies sala suformuota dirbtinai – sujungus tris atskiras, atskirtas durpyno, užpelkėjusio ežero ir pakrančių vandens, saleles. Konvento tipo kunigaikščių rūmai su aukščiausiu – 33 metrų aukščio – bokštu (vadinamu donžonu) ir gynybinėmis atraminėmis sienomis, suformuojant terasą, yra dviejų aukštų, su pusrūsiais ir gynybine pastoge. Gyvenamuosius aukštus juosia medinės galerijos. Iš jų durys veda į devynias menes, kuriose gyveno kunigaikščio šeima, svita ir svečiai, ir į visą aukštą užimančią didžiąją, arba reprezentacinę, menę. Pusrūsyje po ja buvo įrengta virtuvė, priešingoje pusėje, kitame korpuso pusrūsyje, – iždinė. Iš kiemelio matomos pusrūsiuose esančios orinio šildymo pakuros, ant originalaus tinko pilyje visur randama polichrominės tapybos likučių.\r\nTrakų istorijos muziejaus ekspozicija prasideda kairiajame sparne, vadinamosiose „Vytautinėse“ menėse, kuriose, manoma, apsistodavęs Didysis kunigaikštis su žmona. Vitrinose eksponuojami archeologiniai radiniai – šachmatų figūrėlės, Venecijos stiklo šukės, daugiaspalvės glazūros kokliai – byloja, kad XV amžiuje pilis buvo puošniai ir prabangiai įrengta, joje vykdavo įvairios pramogos, šventės, įšventinimai į riterius. Arbaletų strėlių antgaliai – dažnas archeologų radinys – byloja apie intensyvias kovas. Dar daugiau įvairios istorinės ginkluotės pavyzdžių galima apžiūrėti ekspozicijos vitrinose, klausantis nuodugnaus ir informatyvaus šios programėlės pasakojimo. Visą dešiniojo sparno pirmą aukštą užimanti didžioji, arba reprezentacinė, menė – svarbiausia ir puošniausia pilies patalpa. Tai, kad Lietuvos Didžioji Kunigaikštystė XV ir XVI amžiais buvo didžiausia savo plotu Europos valstybė, įrodoma senovės kartografų sukurtais žemėlapiais, o Trakų miesto ir  pilių grožis – pavaizduotas istorinėse graviūrose ir paveiksluose. Trumpai pristatoma XX amžiaus Salos pilies restauravimo istorija: vitražai, kaip ir kai kurie kiti architektūriniai sprendimai (grindų plytelių, medinių galerijų raštai), atkuriant buvo stilizuoti pagal ankstyvosios gotikos analogus.\r\nModernėjantis Trakų istorijos muziejus kiekvienais metais skiria daug dėmesio interaktyvioms pramogoms, įvairaus pobūdžio edukacijoms, nuolat surengia įdomių parodų, renginių ar atnaujina ilgalaikes ekspozicijas. Mūsų tikslas – įdomus, gyvas, nuolat besikeičiantis muziejus.\r\nKviečiame apsilankyti dar ne kartą. Tapkime gerais draugais!"

L'appli fonctionne en effet hors ligne (offline), ce qui vous permet de l'utiliser sans jamais consommer votre forfait téléphonique (autrement dit, l'appli fonctionnera même si vous êtes en mode avion !).\nLa carte compte plusieurs centaines de points d'intérêt triés sur le volet. Vous avez en outre la possibilité de créer une liste de favoris, et même d'ajouter vos propres points d'intérêt sur la carte !\n\nL'appli BPVNY, c'est aussi :\n\n- Des articles sur toutes les choses à savoir avant de partir et une fois sur place\n- Les plans officiels du métro et du bus (accessibles d'une simple touche !)\n- Des plannings-types pour vous aider à prévoir et organiser vos activités\n- Un éditeur de planning (avec la possibilité de créer et sauvegarder plusieurs plannings)\n- La liste des réservations à ne pas oublier avant de partir (avec les liens vers les différents portails de réservation)\n- Un calculateur de pourboires (pour le taxi, le resto...)\n- Un calculateur de taxes (pour le shopping)\n- Un outil de conversion € - $\n- Des checklists pour être sûr de ne rien oublier avant le départ (avec la possibilité de créer ses propres checklists)\n- Un guide de conversation français-anglais\n- Une affiche I love BPVNY (pour faire un clin d’œil à la communauté BPVNY !)\n\nNaturellement, l'appli continuera de s'enrichir au fil de l'eau et proposera toujours plus de services pour répondre aux besoins du plus grand nombre.\nN'hésitez donc pas à me faire part de vos remarques et suggestions d'amélioration !\n\nAlex les bons plans\n\nAuteur : Alexandre Vendé\nDéveloppeurs : Corentin Larroque, Romain Benmansour, Harold Fritsch & Clément Tissier"

Just start the application and type in the amount you want to convert and eCurrency converts instantly. Tap on one of the flags to change the currency you want to convert to. A built-in calculator allows for math calculations. The current exchange rate and rate change compared to the previous day is conveniently displayed in the main interface.\n\n==Favorites Support==\neCurrency supports over 200 currencies. The “Favorites” functionality allows you to define the currency pairs you use as favorites. To create a new favorite go into the “Settings” and touch the “+” Button.

Would you like to leave your house and arrive at your bus stop moments before your bus arrives? How many times did you get to your bus stop just to wave your bus goodbye as it passes you because you were a moment too late? We would all like to just hop onto a bus without waiting ages at a stop. Now we can.\n\nKey features:\n- Search by name: You can add bus stops by searching for them by name\n- Search by ID: You can also add bus stops by entering bus stop ID, each bus stop has its ID printed on a code plate placed above the timetable\n- Search by location: You can quickly add bus stops that are located near you at any time\n- Current location arrivals: You can check bus arrivals at the bus stop that's the closest to you at any time without knowing it's name\n\nDo you have any suggestions for improvements?

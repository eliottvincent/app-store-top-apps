You’ve just made it home from the hospital, exhausted and overwhelmed by your new responsibilities, and need a little help. Don’t worry! In the first few months of your baby's life, it really revolves around eating, sleeping, diaper changes and occasional little doctor's visits. As a new mom, it’s not always easy to remember the last time you fed your baby or changed their diaper. We don’t blame you for falling asleep on the couch occasionally, so we’ve got you covered with handy alarms and reminders. Alarms and graphs are a great way to have an at-a-glance look at what you need to do without stressing over \"what if I forget?”.\n\nOur app will help you keep track of feedings, your baby’s weight and how long they were eating to make sure they’re gaining weight properly and at a normal rate. Unfortunately for some parents, it’s imperative that they track every last drop of food their baby eats since some infants are born with illnesses that make it harder to gain weight normally. Keeping track of diapers is also imperative to keeping your baby healthy. Everyone needs an easy way to check how often they’re changing diapers, and if everything looks normal during each change.\n\nJust click the appropriate button at the beginning of the feeding and other activities. Your baby care history will be reliably stored. All this information may be useful when you visit the pediatrician, as well as for the further development of your child.\n\nCheck your baby’s day to day activities easily and efficiently. This baby care app will help you keep track of everything in one convenient place and help moms take care of themselves by having a peace of mind.\n\nEmail us your comments and suggestions, and we'll implement them as soon as possible!\n\nGOLD STATUS IN THE APP\n- You can subscribe to regularly updated backup and synchronization with relatives\n- The subscription costs $2.49 per month, $11.49 per year, $4.99 and $9.99 for lifetime\n- Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n- Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal\n- Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase\n- Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n- Private Policy - https://wachanga.com/privacy\n- Terms of Use - https://wachanga.com/terms"

      "label": "The simplest program to track breastfeeding, pumping, bottle feeding, solid food consumption, diapers, sleep schedule, height and weight, and more.\n\nWith the click of a button, your feedings and baby care history will be stored in the app. You will have an easy-to-maintain history of your baby’s growth.\n\nThe birth of a baby is a miracle that fills your heart with joy! A mother’s life changes dramatically with the birth of her baby. It is so important for a mother and her newborn baby to establish a comfortable breastfeeding relationship.  Moms need to keep track of which breast to offer her baby, how long the baby suckles at each breast, the number of times the baby breastfeeds each day, how many wet diapers and bowel movements the baby has, how long and frequently the baby sleeps, as well as the baby’s weight and growth.  All of this information is important for the self-assessment of breastfeeding and for assessing the growth of the child.  Having this information easily accessible will be extremely useful when visiting with your pediatrician or lactation consultant.\n\nIt is important to record all of this data. Do not rely on your memory, because even the most organized mothers are often lost in the sea of information about their newborn.\n\nUse the features of the Breastfeeding application.\n\nBreastfeeding and pumping:\n- record the time and quantity of feedings and/or pumpings;\n- note which breast was fed or pumped last to ensure starting new feeding/pumping on the opposite breast;\n- record the duration of feeding/pumping;\n- pause feeding/pumping, if necessary;\n- quickly add feeding/pumping session that was similar to the most recent but updates with the current time\n- use the maximum duration of feeding setting and the application will stop recording the feeding/pumping at the set time if you are unable to press stop\n\nLiquids:\n- consider all of your child’s fluid intake (water, expressed breast milk, formula, juice, etc.);\n -track your child’s reactions to new fluids and leave comments for yourself and other caregivers;\n- set the default fluid volume (can be edited as needed);\n\nFeeding (solid food):\n- add solid foods as your child begins eating them (cereal, vegetables, fruits, meat, fish);\n- track your child’s reactions to these new foods and leave comments for yourself and other caregivers\n- set the default fluid volume (can be edited as needed);\n\nSleep:\n- record the time and duration of your baby’s sleep each day so you can better plan your day;\n- compare your baby’s sleep habits with recommended sleep guidelines\n\nDiapers: \n- track the number of your baby’s wet and/or dirty diapers. This information is crucial for noticing signs of dehydration, constipation, and diarrhea and alerting the child’s pediatrician if necessary.\n\nMeasurements: \n- track height and weight to evaluate your baby’s development;\n\nOther features:\n- edit or delete events as needed;\n- set reminders for various events; \n- use the application in your native language;\n- select your preferred units of measurement;\n- view statistics;\n- enter data for several children and twins;\n- backup all of your data;\n\nAlso available in PRO-version:\n- disable advertising;\t\n- auto backup every 24 hours;\t\n---\nWe offer subscription plans in the app that unlock premium functions of the app:\n- Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\n- Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n- Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal\n- Price can depend on location\n\nFor more information please visit the link https://support.apple.com/HT202039\nPrivacy Policy: https://doc.whisperarts.com/policy/breastfeeding/ios/\nTerms of Use: https://doc.whisperarts.com/terms/breastfeeding/ios/"

For Patients, the App provides easy to understand emergency steps to take in all dental injuries.  The immediate care provided at the site of injury will determine the survival of the injured tooth and the smile of your child. This App should be in every mobile device of everyone around the world. In order to save more teeth and smiles, it’s important you share this App with as many people you can. Start with friends, relatives, teachers and coaches.\n\nFor Professionals, quick access to the Dental Trauma Guidelines provide detailed information caring for patients with dental injuries.  They represent the current evidence based on literature research and professional opinion, as well as additional information about the IADT and resources for continuing education.  As is true for all guidelines, the health care provider must apply clinical judgment dictated by the conditions present in the given traumatic situation. The IADT does not guarantee favorable outcomes from following the Guidelines, but using the recommended procedures can maximize the chances of success."

The application uses the date of the last period and shows the date of the next period, the best days to conceive a baby, the ovulation day and when you can avoid pregnancy.\n\n* Scientific Research *\n\nThe popular baby gender prediction method is used by default. But it’s based only on the widely-spread theory by Landrum Shettles. The application also supports the scientific baby gender prediction method. It’s based on the scientific research by Rodrigo Guerrero and the statistics of thousands of women.\n\nYou can change the gender prediction method on the “Settings” screen. But remember that either gender prediction method shows only slightly higher chances of conceiving a girl or a boy and it never guarantees the result.\n\n* Full Version *\n\nThis is the full version of the application. You will be able to see the following data:\n\n- The probability of getting pregnant on the current or on any selected day.\n- The probability of conceiving a girl or a boy using the selected gender prediction method.\n- Chances of getting pregnant during the current period.\n- Chances of conceiving a girl or a boy during the current period.\n\n* How to Use *\n\nTo generate the menstrual calendar you have to provide the following data:\n\n- The first day of the last cycle (select the day and use the button “Add”).\n- Average length of the menstrual cycle (adjust it on the “Settings” screen).\n- Length of the luteal phase (most women can use the default value).\n\nThe application works best for women with regular menstrual cycle. But average cycle length is also a good way to predict when the ovulation should happen."

      "label": "Blood pressure diary app including weight tracker, blood sugar tracker, medication calendar and medication reminder.\nAn external blood pressure monitor is required to record values.\n\nApproximately one quarter of the world's population is suffering from hypertension, 5% suffer from low blood pressure (hypotension). Many people do not even know that they are affected, as it usually come without symptoms. However, it is risk factor number one for cardiovascular diseases. Therefore people should check their values regularly and keep the data in a bp log.\n\nAt the end of 2018 we finally wanted to take high blood pressure management more seriously ourselves and started developing a smart blood pressure app: AVAX Blood Pressure Diary.\n\n* CORE FEATURES\nSome the reasons that make it the best free blood pressure app:\n- Comprehensive charts help you to visualize longer periods of data.\n- Statistics that follow current hypertension guidelines and that are easy to understand and give a clear picture of what your arterial pressure looks like.\n- Our medication calendar let's you track your intake history and allows you to set up custom medication reminder to avoid forgetting to take your medication.\n- The app can also remind you whenever it is time for you to take your blood pressure.\n- A monthly status chart shows you if you are actively tracking our bp.\n- Easily view your history and export it to CSV or XLSX. There is no limitation to get your data.\n- New records can be entered in just a few seconds\n- Weight tracker: Track weight (to see if there is a link) or manage weight loss.\n- Diabetes tracker: We help you to track blood sugar and manage diabetes.\n- Various customization options to make our bp app work you and not the other way round.\n\n* USAGE INFORMATION & DATA PROTECTION\nProtecting your personal data is very important to us. The key points here are:\n- Login via google account or via email - or use the app completely anonymously (without login)\n- We do not track any information that would help someone to identify you. Only your email address is being recorded (unless you do not use a login at all, of course)\n- No data is being shared with 3rd parties\n- No permissions on your phone or access to personal information is required\n- An active internet connection is needed to syncronize across devices\n\n* IMPORTANT INFORMATION\nFinally, one last important piece of information: Our app is designed as a companion app for information only. Measuring with your home blood pressure checker, keeping a blood pressure log in a blood pressure tracker app should be part of your therapy, but it can't replace a doctor. We can not be made liable for any issues that occur as a result of using our hypertension app, our medication diary or weight tracker. Please consult your doctor to discuss hypertension management.\n\nWe hope you enjoy our app and it helps you to keep your diary and possibly even lower blood pressure levels or achieve weight loss. If you like us, we would be very happy about your feedback and rating.\n\nIf you have suggestions for features or encounter any issues, please reach out to us at info@avax.app\n\nStart now with AVAX Blood Pressure Diary free of charge!\n\nTerms of Use: https://avax.app/terms\nPrivacy Policy: https://avax.app/privacy-policy"

These include associated patient histories, auscultation sounds and chest x-rays.\n\nImportant information:  The audio quality of the sounds played through a computer, tablet or smartphone device may not be a faithful representation of the actual sounds heard on auscultation.  This is due to the acoustical performance of sound cards, their associated drivers, or the frequency response of the headphones or speakers used.  Therefore there is a possibility that the user may not be able to fully hear all clinically relevant sounds.  We recommend the use of a high quality pair of headphones.\n\nDisclaimer:  Whilst based on genuine real patient histories information, all patients represented in this educational package are fictitious and any similarity with persons past or present is purely coincidental.

Diastolic pressure tends to begin to rise at the same time but starts to fall earlier in mid-life, approximately age 55. Mean blood pressure rises from early adulthood, plateauing in mid-life, while pulse pressure rises quite markedly after the age of 40.\n\nConsequently, in many older people, systolic blood pressure often exceeds the normal adult range. The rise in pulse pressure with age is attributed to increased stiffness of the arteries.\n\nStay healthy!"

And there is no more reliable resource for trauma information than the American College of Surgeons (ACS).  This app was developed alongside their seminal course, Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS). ATLS has trained more than 1.5 million participants in more than 75,000 courses around the world.    \n\nATLS provides the essential information and skills for doctors, nurses, and other health professionals to identify and treat life-threatening injuries under the extreme pressures of the trauma environment. The international nature of the program means that the content is adaptable to a variety of geographic, economic, social, and medical practice situations.\n\nWhether in a hospital trauma bay, on the highway at a motor vehicle crash, in a disaster area after a bombing, or in a foreign country’s war zone, clinicians need ready access to critical resources and references.   The content and skills presented in this app will add to the armamentarium of doctors and other clinicians who treat trauma patients.  \n\nThe app includes a free preview of the 1st chapter.\n\nAdditional content can be purchased to instantly gain full access to the following:\n• Interactive visuals, such as treatment algorithms and x-ray identification \n• Just in Time video segments capturing key skills in minutes \n• Calculators, such as pediatric burn calculator and the Parkland Formula to determine fluid administration\n• Animations, such as airway management and surgical cricothyroidotomy\n\nFor those who have purchased the 9th edition of the ATLS Student Course Manual, simply enter the book code that was packaged in the book to gain free access to all the content."

      "label": "The ASHRAE HVAC Duct Sizer application allows you to quickly size one HVAC duct run or a range of duct sizes using the constant friction method. Think of this application as a digital version of the classic Trane Ductulator.\n \nIn the \"Size by Airflow\" mode, you can specify the total airflow in CFM (or L/s), the aspect ratio and one of either the velocity of air or the friction loss per 100 feet (30 meters). The results include both the exact and rounded height and width (or diameter) dimensions and the calculated velocity and friction loss.\n \nIn the \"Size by Dimensions\" mode, you can analyze an existing duct system. There are options to input the existing duct dimensions and one of either the airflow or velocity values to derive the calculated duct friction loss.\n \nIn the \"Range of Duct Sizes\" mode, you can specify minimum and maximum friction loss and airflow values to display a range of duct sizes that fall in between the friction loss bounds.\n \nYou can specify additional parameters such as the duct shape (rectangular, round, or oval), the air temperature and the air pressure. You can also choose to display values in either English (IP) or Metric (SI) units.\n \nThis application uses slider controls that allow you to quickly increment or decrement the input values and immediately observe the calculated results.\n \nThis app now works on your iPhone and iPad and adjusts its screen size accordingly.\n \nFinally, you can email all of the inputs and results from all 3 input modes to perform further analysis using your desktop computer. The email includes HTML text and a .CSV attachment that can be imported into any popular spreadsheet.\n \nThe ASHRAE HVAC Duct Sizer application was designed by Carmel Software Corporation for ASHRAE."

The unique data entry GUI employing sliders and buttons improves upon the more typical keypad pad mechanism.\n\nHowever, there is a keypad data entry option that allows for numbers greater than +1000 and less than -1000, including number with two decimal place accuracy.\n\nInternal rate of return can be computed over 1 to 12 years for the quick slider input option and over 1 to 20 years for the extended keypad input option.\n\nAlthough periodic amounts are shown as yearly amounts, the user may interpret these as generic periodic amounts. For example, each amount could be considered a quarterly amount and the IRR computed would be interpreted as the return based on that frequency as well.\n\nThe iPad version allows you to add, retrieve, reorder, or delete data sets. It also displays a graph of the present value of the cash flows discounted at various rates between 0% and 25%."

But the benefit is considerable. No longer tethered to your laptop, you can move around the room while still holding in your hand an image of what’s on the screen behind you. No more of that weird over-the-shoulder karaoke move when checking to see where you are in the presentation.\"\n\nGo to your next PowerPoint presentation IN STYLE with i-Clickr Remote for iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch!\n\nFeatures:\n\n* Complete control of your PowerPoint presentation including animations.\n* Record your presentation (slides and your voice audio) into a movie as you present.\n* Share PDF version of the presentation with audience via E-Mail.\n* View your slides AND slide notes directly on your iOS device during your presentation.\n* Navigate through your slides with finger swipes and taps.\n* Grab your audience's attention with real-time annotations (Windows only).\n* Help you track your presentation time with onboard clock.\n* Set presentation alarm so that your iOS device will alert you with a silent buzz before your time runs out.\n* Pause and resume presentations.\n* Switch between multiple slideshow.\n* Work with both Windows and Mac Office (see below for the Office versions supported), iWork '09 Keynote on Mac, and OpenOffice on Windows.\n* Easy to set up with zero configuration.\n* No additional cost when using with multiple host computers.\n* NEW: Control presentation from your Apple Watch.\n* NEW: Control external laser pointer.\n\nRequirement:\n\n* On Windows, support all versions of Microsoft PowerPoint (the free Microsoft PowerPoint Viewer is not supported).  Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows (version XP or above) is required at the host PC. \n* On Mac OS X, Office Mac 2004 or above, or iWork '09 Keynote is required.\n* WiFi connection between the host computer and your device, or connection using direct ad hoc network and the iOS’s personal hotspot.  \n* Also support the FREE OpenOffice 3.1 on Windows.\n\nTo download software required at your host computer (that is, the PC/Mac that will run your PowerPoint presentation), visit http://www.senstic.com/iPhone/iClickr/Download.aspx\n\n*** If you have problem getting i-Clickr to work, please contact us at support@senstic.com, and we will help you fix the problem."

Get started with one of our ready-to-go form templates, or easily make a custom one from scratch with our integrated form building tools.\n\n• Store confidential data with confidence: Tap Forms' security settings let you optionally require a password or a Touch ID scan, and even auto-lock when idle for a custom period of time. Using AES encryption, you can rest easy knowing your data is safe and secure.\n\n• Import, Export, Share: It’s easy to import your data from existing files, so getting started is a breeze. Import your data from text, CSV, Bento and more. One-tap exporting allows you to share with Mac, Windows, and Linux users.\n\nAdvanced Features:\n\n• Scripting support for writing JavaScript code for performing all kinds of operations on your forms and records.\n• Siri Shortcuts let you record a voice command to execute any Form script.\n• Multi-column (table) view of your records.\n• AirDrop records to your nearby contacts.\n• Sync with Tap Forms for iOS and Mac using iCloud, IBM Cloudant, Nearby (WiFi), or with your own Apache CouchDB sync server.\n• Saved search rules with multi-field record filtering\n• Built-in Backup & Restore\n• 1Password Extension integration for logging into your Cloudant sync account.\n• Document Picker support for accessing iCloud and other document service providers.\n• Pick lists for quick data entry\n• AES-256 bit encryption\n• Import & Export standard CSV files from Excel, Numbers, or other systems\n• Print record details\n• Lightning fast search\n• Share form templates with friends, family, and co-workers\n• Notify you of things that need your attention using alerts\n• Barcode scanning of UPC/EAN and QR codes (iOS only)\n\nStore 25 different types of information, such as:\n\n• Script\n• Table\n• Link to form (relational links between forms)\n• Inverse relationships\n• File Attachment with multi-file support\n• Email address\n• GPS location\n• Contact\n• Text\n• Date\n• Time\n• Date & time\n• Number\n• Rating\n• Web site address\n• Check mark\n• Note\n• Audio notes (record on iOS, playback on Mac)\n• Photos\n• Drawings (draw on iOS, view on Mac)\n• Phone number\n• Section headings\n• Calculations\n• Signatures\n\nIncludes more than 30 built-in forms, including:\n\n• Audio dictation\n• Bank accounts\n• Clients\n• Client call log\n• Credit & debit cards\n• Daily journal\n• Expenses\n• Frequent flyer numbers\n• Health insurance\n• Homework assignments\n• Loyalty cards\n• Personal health cards\n• Security alarm codes\n• Serial numbers\n• Vehicle insurance\n• Website accounts\n• Wine collection"

Even ones with many dozens of megapixels! I have been looking for something like this. Others I have tried are extremely slow at scrolling or zooming, or can't handle the large images I want to view. But LargeViewer is screaming fast and can handle ever size image I have tried.\"\n\n\"LargeViewer is the best large image viewer I have seen, by far. And now with the new iPad with retina display it's even more useful! Simply stunning! If you want to view pretty much any resolution image and really show off what the retina display can do, you've got to get this app! Butter smooth scrolling, and just refuses to crash even when throwing 80-megapixel Phase One IQ180 images at it!” \n\n\t\"I am a professional civil engineer. I now have all my drawings loaded to my iPad when I go for inspections. It works well for large files and it is FAST.\"\n\n\"Incredible. Test passed with a TIFF file from 11.000 x 5700, weight 190 MB. Fantastic. It has a button to zoom to 100%, and it’s easy to go beyond the resolution of the file. Thanks and congratulations for the work. App absolutely recommended.” \n\n► To get answers to your questions and make suggestions for future improvements, tap LargeViewer's Email Support button."

      "label": "5 Stars. “I can't tell you how often I use it, probably about as much as the phone app!\" \n- CharlieW, President. Waterman & Company (Real Estate Investment and Development)\n\n“This is the first 12C type calculator for the itouch that has actually made me put down my real 12C. One of the best features of this calculator is the register display where you can see what is in FV, I, PV, PMT, etc. That alone makes it worth the $14.95 price. Consider the many other features that it has over and above the real 12C and you have one sweet program here. Best of the 12C emulators out there - hands down! “\n- tsinvest\n\nIt started in early 2008 with a belief that:\n • there was one and only one insanely great financial calculator\n • the iPhone is the perfect platform to bring that calculator back to life\n • it's not good enough to just copy the old, you have to make it better\n • a financial calculator is a professional tool, not a game\n \nFrom this mindset came Calc-12E, the first 12C emulator on the App Store. It was expensive back then ($20-$25) and compared to a game it still is because, well, you usually get what you pay for. Specifically:\n\nForemost, if the math isn't right in the corner cases I can't trust the calculator. Calc-12E's algorithms were written for iOS by a (the?) key member of the original 12C development team who incorporated his solutions to the quirks in financial computation that historically tripped up lesser implementations. There are reasons the 12C was the absolute best, and Calc-12E draws directly on that heritage.\n \nWhile the original did what it could, 1980s technology made many features difficult, impractical or impossible to use. Calc-12E pioneered the following innovations to address shortcomings:\n    • you can always see what's in the financial registers (and stack if you choose) so you have instant assurance that you've entered your data correctly. This feature has been copied by nearly every emulator on the App Store, for good reason.\n    • visual cash flow editing radically eases how you deal with cash flows... believe it or not it is actually easy to manipulate cash flows with Calc-12E. There's a demo on YouTube, search for Calc12E.\n    • Investment mode allows you to simultaneously evaluate metrics on up to three cash flow scenarios at a time. You can compare cash flows side-by-side AND because of visual cash flow editing you can play what-if games\n    • the results of some calculations need to \"leave the phone\" to be useful. Amortization schedules, leasing terms, bond yields... everything can be sent via email using customizable templates\n    \nFinally, a professional tool receives continuing support and updates. It does not nag you to rate it, it does not invite you to pay to get more. It does not crash. Check out Calc-12E's version history and reviews of previous versions. This is a live, supported app with tens of thousands of long term customers and I have never charged for an upgrade or cloaked features behind ads or paywalls. It's not ethical at this level (in my humble opinion!).\n\nWhen you buy Calc-12E you get my best (and evolving!) rendition of the most popular handheld calculator ever made. It's core (the math) comes from the same mind as your trusty original and to that foundation you get usability advances that actually enhance the overall tool."

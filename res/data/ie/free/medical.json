Contact tracing\n\nContact tracing identifies people who were in close contact with someone who has coronavirus. For example, family members, friends, colleagues or fellow travellers.\n\nThe app will help contact tracing by:\n\nreducing the time it takes to alert you if you're a close contact\nnotifying close contacts that might have been forgotten\nenabling us to contact people who are unknown to each other\nThe app uses Bluetooth technology and anonymous IDs to log:\n\n-any phone you are in contact with that also has the app installed\n-the distances between your phone and other phones that use the app\n-the length of time your phone is near other phones that use the app \n\nEvery 2 hours the app on your phone downloads a list of anonymous IDs. These have been shared with the HSE by people using the app who have tested positive for coronavirus. \n\nIf you have been closer than 2 metres for more than 15 minutes with any of these phones you will receive a notification that you are a close contact.\n\nClose contact alerts\nIf the app finds that you have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus, you will get an alert.\n\nYou'll be advised to:\n\n-restrict your movements\n-get tested for coronavirus\n\nYou won't know who the contact is or where the contact happened.\n\nIf you test positive\nIf you test positive for coronavirus, you can choose to use the app to anonymously alert other app users you have been in close contact with.\n\nAlerting your close contacts\nOur contact tracing team will phone you if you test positive. They will ask you if you have the app.\n\nIf you have the app, they will ask you to share your set of anonymous IDs through the app. It's your choice if you want to do this.\n\nThe contact tracing team will send you a unique upload code by text message. This code unlocks the upload functionality on the app.\n\nYou can then upload your anonymous IDs for the last 14 days.\n\nOnly the HSE can issue upload codes. People who do not have the virus will not be able to use this function.\n\n2. COVID check-in\n\nYou can use this to:\n\n-track how you feel each day\n-find out if you have symptoms of coronavirus\n-get advice on what to do\n\nAny information you share on the app is anonymous. \n\nOptional information sharing\nWhen you first use the app you'll have the option to share:\n\n- your county or town\n- the age group you are in\n- your sex\n\nThis information can help us to map and predict the spread of the virus. We will not ask for precise details about your age or where you live.\n\n3. Updates and information\n\nYou can use the app to get the latest facts and figures about coronavirus in Ireland. You can also get advice to help you to care for yourself if you are sick.\n\nPrivacy\nYour data is collected anonymously and stored on your phone. Your name, location or movements are not tracked.\n\nYou will be asked to allow the app to collect:\n\n- your anonymous data\n- anonymous data sent by other app users' devices\n\nYou can choose:\n\n- what data you want to share\n- to change your privacy settings at any time\n- to use the app without sharing any data at all\n\nNo one will ever know your personal details unless you choose to share them.

We may need a rash identifier, a mole checker, a skin analyzer, or an acne scanner, depending on the problem. The AI-Dermatologist app combines all these functions. We have designed this modern skin analyzer so that by using it on a regular basis, if you suspect a problem, you can contact your healthcare providers in time and avoid complications.\n\nBased on today's most advanced Artificial intelligence technologies and professional knowledge and expertise in dermatology, our application enables you to check all your skin problems for risk assessment: spots, birthmarks, acne, moles or papillomas. In 1 minute AI-Dermatologist gives a result on the next step to be taken. Likewise, AI-Dermatologist gives you the opportunity to store photos to keep track of changes over time and monitor your skin health in the long run. By creating AI-Dermatologist, we supported the idea of making skin screening and monitoring accessible to everyone.\n\nWith AI-Dermatologist you can:\n- Snapshot your skin spots, birth-marks, mole or another skin diseases such as: angioma, warts, papillomas, mollusks and etc.\n- Take / upload photos and track results for changes\n- Get a reminder when it is time to take a new photo, take pills or build a skin care routine \n- Сreate your own scheme for the medicines or cosmetics’ use according to your schedule \n- Track dynamics of baseline and follow-up results\n- Easily log the tracked your skin conditions locations on your body\n\nPlease note that AI-Dermatologist is not a diagnostic tool and does not replace or cancel a visit to your doctor. This application aims to help you be more aware of your skin condition via self-exams, but it is not an online dermatology platform. If you ever feel uncomfortable or see that your skin spot is changing, irritated, itchy or bleeding, we strongly recommend that you contact a medical specialist without hesitation to avoid the risk of melanoma or other skin diseases.\n\nBy signing up for this subscription, you agree to our\nTerms of use http://ai-derm.com/terms/terms_of_use.html\nPrivacy Policy http://ai-derm.com/privacy/privacy.html"

      "label": "You can help save the life of someone having a sudden cardiac arrest.\n\nPulsePoint AED is a free app that makes it easy to help build the public registry of AEDs (automated external defibrillators) in your community, or anywhere. These lifesaving devices automatically diagnose and treat cardiac arrest and are commonly available in offices, airports, schools, businesses and other public places.\n\nThe registry grows when PulsePoint AED app users log the location of AEDs in their community, making these lifesaving devices easier to find and use when a cardiac emergency strikes.\n\nAEDs that are added to the registry using the PulsePoint AED app are accessible to emergency dispatchers, nearby citizens trained in CPR, and off-duty professionals such as firefighters, paramedics and nurses. Instead of asking the caller if there is an AED available, emergency dispatch center staff can tell the caller exactly where to find one of these lifesaving devices (T-AED).\n\nPulsePoint AED also records and displays other lifesaving resources placed at AED locations including Bleeding Control Kits, Naloxone (e.g., NARCAN®) and Epinephrine (e.g., EpiPen®).\n\nWatch this brief video to see just how easy it is to add an AED to the community registry https://vimeo.com/pulsepoint/AED-iOS\n\nYou can also add an AED to the registry anytime by simply entering aed.new into your browser.\n\nIf you are trained in CPR and willing to assist during a nearby cardiac emergency, please consider downloading the companion app, PulsePoint Respond.\n\nPublic Safety Agencies\nPublic safety organizations such as EMS, fire services, law enforcement, and emergency dispatch are encouraged to review AEDs in their jurisdiction. PulsePoint’s hosted AED registry offers a simple workflow for public safety professionals to manage all required tasks and provides the ability to view community AED information during call processing or directly within an EMD protocol. There is never a charge to use or add to the registry.\n\nPulsePoint AED is an end-to-end FirstNet Certified™ application. FirstNet Certified solutions must demonstrate 99.99% availability and pass independent third-party security, data privacy and performance audits.\n\nPulsePoint is a public 501(c)(3) non-profit foundation. We offer the PulsePoint AED and Respond apps and dispatch-connected AED registry as part of our mission to improve cardiac arrest survival.

You will be charged to your iTunes account and will automatically renew within 24 hours prior to the end of the current subscription period, unless auto-renewal is disabled beforehand. The subscription is then automatically renewed each year unless auto-renewal is disabled. To manage your subscriptions or to disable auto-renewal, after purchase, go to your iTunes account settings.\n\nSubscription is priced at €5.99 per year:\n\nThe Formulary privacy policy which may be viewed at http://mobanode.mobi/formulary_privacy_policy.html\nThe Formulary Terms of Use which may be viewed at http://mobanode.mobi/formulary_terms.html\n\nThis app is intended for Healthcare professionals only and as such, before allowing access to the critical information in the Drugs Dosages section, OLCHC requires each user to register to create a record of users that can help verify that any individual user is a medical professional if needed.

You might want to know if their glucose levels go too high or too low, be able to quickly and easily access their insulin pump and Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) system information. \r\n \r\nWith the CareLink™ Connect app, now you can remotely see their glucose levels and insulin pump information wherever you are, so you can know how they are doing.\r\n\r\nThe CareLink™ Connect app helps you quickly accomplish these tasks: \r\nLet you securely view glucose levels, graphs, and trends\r\nSends you high or low glucose levels notifications, so you can be informed and supportive\r\nShows you the status of the insulin pump system, for greater peace of mind\r\n\r\nTo remotely view pump system information, family members or friends need to install the CareLink™ Connect app on their compatible mobile device. Also, the person with diabetes needs a MiniMed™ 700-series insulin pump, the MiniMed™ Mobile app installed on a compatible mobile device, which then should be connected online to the CareLink™ software. To find a list of compatible devices, please visit your local Medtronic website. \r\n\r\nIMPORTANT NOTE: In order to receive real-time updates, the app needs to continuously receive data from the CareLink™ servers, and the insulin pump system needs to sync with the CareLink™ servers through the MiniMed™ Mobile app. The CareLink™ Connect app only works with the MiniMed™ 700-series insulin pump systems; it currently does not support other standalone CGM systems, MiniMed™ or Paradigm™ insulin pumps. \r\n\r\nThe CareLink™ Connect app is intended to provide a secondary display of insulin pump and CGM (Continuous Glucose Monitoring) system data on a supported mobile device. CareLink™ Connect app is not intended to replace the real-time display of insulin pump or CGM data on the primary display device. All therapy decisions should be based on the primary display device.\r\n\r\nCareLink™ Connect app is not intended to analyze or modify the insulin pump and CGM data that it receives. Nor is it intended to control any function of the insulin pump or CGM system to which it is connected. CareLink™ Connect app is not intended to receive information directly from the insulin pump or CGM system.\r\n\r\nThis app store should not be used as your first point of contact to resolve technical or customer services issues. In order to protect your privacy and personal information, and promptly resolve any technical or customer services issues you are having with any Medtronic product, please contact the local Medtronic support line. \r\n\r\nMedtronic may be required to actively contact customers regarding complaints related to products.

      "label": "Pippo is an integrated online patient portal, developed by Clanwilliam Health and it aims to continue our work to digitise GP practices. By allowing appointments to be booked online Pippo aims to reduce the number of calls to practices and to free up staff to focus on providing the best possible patient care. Pippo is the only patient information portal that fully integrates with Clanwilliam Health’s GP systems to allow a patient to make an instant appointment booking, whenever and wherever suits them.\n\nPlease note Pippo is currently only available for Irish GP Practices and you must be a registered patient of practice that is using Pippo in order to use the app.\n\nAbout Pippo\n\nPippo makes booking your GP appointments simple. Download the app, register with your GP practice and start booking your appointments online. It’s that easy! You can even add your children to the Pippo app and book their appointments directly from your phone. With Pippo you’ll never have to wait on hold to reach your GP. We will continue to develop Pippo to add in other functionality which makes it easy for patients to communicate with their GP’s. \n\nPippo also features an integrated payments solution which means (if enabled by a practice) that you can book and pay for your appointments online, meaning all you have to do is go to your GP practice. Pippo is designed to make booking appointments easier for patients and practices. It is completely integrated with Clanwilliam Health’s software systems, Socrates and Helix Practice Manager. This means that practices can manage their online appointments directly from their practice management system.\n\nThis is good for patients too as it means appointments can be booked at any time of the day or night, without having to call your practice. Our API ensures that appointments cannot be double booked and that you only see time slots that are available to be booked online.\n\nAbout Clanwilliam Health\n\nClanwilliam Health is the primary and secondary care management solutions Division of Clanwilliam Group. In the 1980s, we delivered our first software system to pharmacies in Ireland. By the 90's we had delivered our first practice management system for private consultants and general practitioners.\n\nToday Clanwilliam Health holds over 25 years of experience developing and designing healthcare software. Our extensive range of innovative technology now empowers more than 20,000 clinical users across Ireland and the UK to deliver safer, more efficient and cost-effective patient services.\n\nOur vision is to enable the seamless flow of patient data by connecting primary and secondary healthcare software systems to enhance patient experiences. We work hard every day to achieve this by putting our customers at the centre of everything we do and partnering with key industry stakeholders to ensure our systems consistently exceed expectations.\n\nAs a Division of Clanwilliam Group, we also share their mission of working together to improve healthcare for everyone by connecting people, products and places.\n\nOur vast experience of working with GPs, Consultants, Pharmacists, Care Homes and Hospitals gives us a unique understanding of how technology can help improve efficiencies for healthcare providers while also enhancing the patient experience. This expertise has fuelled our involvement in a number of bigger picture projects, in collaboration with various stakeholders, such as:\n\ne-referral scheme\nIndividual Health Identifier (IHI)\nE-prescribing\nChronic Disease Management\nOur practice management software applications (traditional and hosted) are used by both General Practitioners and Hospital Consultants. Our pharmacy software applications are used in both community and hospital pharmacies while major chains, groups, multiples and large numbers of independent pharmacies make up our customer base.\n\nWe pride ourselves on our values and make sure we stick to them in all our internal and external interactions"

      "label": "O Conecte SUS Cidadão é o aplicativo oficial do Ministério da Saúde, onde o cidadão brasileiro pode visualizar as interações realizadas nos pontos de atenção à saúde e acompanhar o seu histórico no Sistema Único de Saúde (SUS), como exames, vacinas, dispensação de medicamentos e localização de estabelecimentos de saúde. \nO cenário de risco à população provocado pela pandemia do novo Coronavírus exigiu respostas contundentes de todo o sistema de saúde, em especial do SUS, para coordenar as ações nacionais e orquestrar os esforços de estados, municípios e, também, da Saúde Suplementar. Diante disso, o Conecte SUS, a partir da implementação da Rede Nacional de Dados em Saúde (RNDS), foi redirecionado para receber e compartilhar informações que auxiliem no controle da situação de emergência da saúde pública, com destaque ao processo de vacinação Covid-19 no Brasil.\nFuncionalidades:\nAcesse os resultados de exames realizados por qualquer laboratório no território nacional integrado à RNDS para a detecção da Covid-19;\nVeja seu histórico de vacinação na Carteira de Vacinação Digital;\n*No momento, o Conecte SUS apenas apresenta os dados relacionados à vacinação contra a Covid-19, especificando a data da aplicação, o nome da vacina, o lote, o estabelecimento de saúde e o código do vacinador. Gradativamente serão disponibilizadas as demais vacinas ministradas pelo SUS.\nEmita o Certificado Nacional de Vacinação Covid-19 na palma da mão. \nApós as duas doses da vacina (ou a dose única) serem registradas pelos estados ou municípios na RNDS¹, é possível emitir o certificado em pdf nos idiomas português, inglês e espanhol. Esse documento é válido em todo território nacional e pode ser autenticado gratuitamente, utilizando o leitor ValidaQRCode no próprio aplicativo ou digitando o código do documento em:\n https://validacertidao.saude.gov.br/;\n*No certificado é especificado os dados cadastrais da pessoa vacinada (nome, data de nascimento, sexo, CPF), data e horário de emissão, além de informações sobre as doses administradas, como a data de aplicação, nome da vacina, lote e estabelecimento de saúde. \nAcesse o histórico de internação hospitalar no SUS;\n*Dados a partir de abril de 2018.\n·      Veja os medicamentos dispensados pela Farmácia Popular;\nLocalize rapidamente os estabelecimentos mais próximos como os serviços de Saúde Bucal e Doenças Raras;\nConsulte dicas nutricionais e de atividades físicas e verifique o Índice de Massa Corporal (IMC) na funcionalidade “Peso Saudável”;\n \nQuer saber mais?\nAcesso o Conecte SUS na web em: https://conectesus-paciente.saude.gov.br/\nAcesse os portais:\nhttps://www.gov.br/saude/pt-br/assuntos/conecte-sus\nhttps://www.gov.br/pt-br/servicos/certificado-nacional-de-vacinacao-covid-19\nhttps://www.gov.br/saude/pt-br/assuntos/saude-digital\nhttps://www.gov.br/saude/pt-br/assuntos/rnds\n¹ Os registros são de responsabilidade dos gestores estaduais e municipais de saúde, que fazem a coleta e envio das informações para a base de dados do Ministério da Saúde. Eles são feitos pelas equipes responsáveis do centro de vacinação ou da unidade de saúde onde a dose foi aplicada. Os dados são inseridos nos sistemas de informação próprios ou integrados à RNDS, no Sistema de Informações do Programa Nacional de Imunizações (SI-PNI) ou Sistema e-SUS Atenção Primária à Saúde (s-SUS APS). Após os dados enviados e processados, são inseridos de forma automática no Conecte SUS, que está disponível pelo celular ou na versão web."

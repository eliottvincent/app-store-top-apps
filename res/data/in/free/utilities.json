The App features an array of Aadhaar services and a personalised section for the Aadhaar holder who can carry their Aadhaar information in form of a soft copy, instead of carrying a physical copy all the time.  \n\nThe key features in mAadhaar:\nMultilingual : In order to ensure the Aadhaar Services are accessible to linguistically diverse residents of India, the menu, button labels and form fields are provided in English as well as in 12 Indian languages (Hindi, Assamese, Bengali, Gujarati, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Odia, Punjabi, Tamil, Telugu and Urdu). After installation the user will be prompted to select any of the preferred language.  However the input fields in the forms will accept data entered in English language only.  This is done to help user avoid facing the challenges of typing in regional languages (due to limitation in the mobile keyboards).\n\nUniversality: Resident with or without Aadhaar can install this App in their smart phones. However to avail personalised Aadhaar services the resident will have to register their Aadhaar Profile in the App. \n\nAadhaar Online Services on Mobile: The mAadhaar user can avail the featured services for themselves as well as for any other resident seeking Aadhaar or related help.\nThe functionalities are broadly grouped as :\n\nMain Service Dashboard : Direct access to download Aadhaar, Order an Reprint, Address Update, Download offline eKYC, Show or Scan QR Code, Verify Aadhaar,  Verify mail/email, retrieve UID/EID, Request for Address Validation Letter\n\nRequest Status Services : To help resident check status of various online requests.\n\nMy Aadhaar: This is a personalised section for Aadhaar holder where resident will not have to enter their Aadhaar number to avail Aadhaar services. In addition this section also provides facility for the resident to lock/unlock their Aadhaar or Biometric Authentication.  \n\nAadhaar Locking – Aadhaar holder can lock their UID/Aadhaar number anytime they wish. \nBiometric locking/unlocking secures biometric authentication by locking biometrics data. Once resident enables Biometric Locking system their biometric remains locked till the Aadhaar Holder chose to either unlock it (which is temporary) or Disable the Locking system.\n\nTOTP generation – Time-based One-Time Password is an automatically generated temporary password which can be used instead of SMS based OTP.\n\nUpdate of profile – To updated view of Aadhaar profile data after successful completion of update request.\n\nSharing of QR code and eKYC data by Aadhaar Number holder helps Aadhaar user share their password protected eKYC or QR code for safe and paperless verification.\n\nMulti-profile: Aadhaar holder can include multiple (upto 3) profiles (with same registered mobile number)  in their profile section.\n\nLocate Enrolment Center helps user find nearest Enrolment Center."

This data is not accessible by Google or by any apps, and can be cleared at any time.\n• If you’ve turned on contacts search in Gboard search settings, this allows Gboard to search the contacts on your device so you can easily share. None of these queries are sent to Google."

      "label": "Get the people-first browser that’s backed by a non-profit. \n\nIt’s a new era in tech. Don’t settle for a browser produced by giant, profit-driven, data-hoarding tech companies. Firefox is the obvious choice for independent, ethical tech that respects your privacy and gives you more ways than ever to tailor your internet experience exactly the way you want it. Download Firefox now for iPhone, iPad and Mac.\n\nFirefox is backed by the non-profit Mozilla Foundation, whose mission is to ensure the internet remains a global public resource, open and accessible to everyone. When you make Firefox your go-to, everyday browser, you’re also joining a unique (serious nerd cred) community that’s actively helping to diversify the way people experience the internet.  \n\nFirefox is extremely private for a reason — and the reason is you. \nWe want you to have an amazing experience every time you use Firefox. We know feeling safe and secure are foundational for enjoying your time online. Since version 1 in 2004, we’ve taken privacy seriously, because we’ve always been in the business of valuing people first, over everything. When you care more about people than profits, privacy naturally becomes a top priority.\n\nDIFFERENT DEVICES.  SAME TRAIN OF THOUGHT\nNow you can search for things on your laptop, then pick up the exact same search on your phone and vice versa. Your Firefox homepage displays the most recent searches you’ve done on other devices so you can easily get back to what you were doing or thinking about. \n\nLIMITED-EDITION WALLPAPERS\nIntroducing limited-edition wallpapers from independent creators. Stick with one you love or switch it up anytime to make Firefox match your mood. \n\n\nSTREAMLINED HOME SCREEN\nPick up right where you left off. See all your open tabs intuitively grouped and displayed along with your recent bookmarks, top sites and popular articles recommended by Pocket.\n\nPRIVACY CONTROL IN ALL THE RIGHT PLACES\nFirefox gives you greater privacy protection while you’re on the web. By default, Firefox blocks trackers and scripts such as social media trackers, cross-site cookie trackers, cryptominers and fingerprinters. In addition to Apple’s Intelligent Tracking Prevention, setting Firefox’s Enhanced Tracking Protection to strict blocks tracking content in all windows. Also, you can easily choose to search in private browsing mode. And when you close private browsing mode, your browsing history and any cookies are automatically erased from your device.\n\nGET FIREFOX ON  ALL YOUR DEVICES\nAdd Firefox across your devices for secure, seamless browsing. In addition to synced tabs and searches, Firefox makes password management easy by remembering your passwords across devices.\n\nFIND IT FAST WITH FIREFOX’S SEARCH BAR\nGet search suggestions in the search bar and quickly access the sites you visit most. Type in your search question and get suggested and previously searched results across your favorite search engines.\n\nORGANIZE YOUR TABS THE WAY YOU LIKE\nCreate as many tabs as you like without losing track. Firefox displays your open tabs as thumbnails and numbered tabs, making it easy to find what you want quickly.\n\nSHARE ANYTHING IN A FEW TAPS\nThe Firefox web browser makes it easy to share links to web pages or specific items on a page with easy, quick access to your most recently used apps.\n\nLEARN MORE ABOUT FIREFOX WEB BROWSER:\n- Read about Firefox permissions: http://mzl.la/Permissions\n- Learn more about what’s up at Mozilla: https://blog.mozilla.org\n\nABOUT MOZILLA\nMozilla exists to build the Internet as a public resource accessible to all because we believe open and free is better than closed and controlled. We build products like Firefox to promote choice and transparency and give people more control over their lives online.

You can upgrade to unlimited font installs with a one-time in-app purchase.\n\nNOTE: Fonteer does NOT make it possible to change the font on your homescreen, in messaging or email. Please check app compatibility before purchase!\n\nInstall OpenType (.otf) or TrueType (.ttf) fonts on your devices! Email the fonts as a configuration profile and install to make the fonts available in any application that allows you to use the system fonts.

If the app is not supported please contact the developer and request supported for all installed fonts. Let them contact us if necessary; adding support is really easy!\n\n= FAQ =\nQ: What fonts can I install?\nA: Almost any. You can locate .otf and .ttf font files on your Mac or PC, mail them and open in Fonteer. You can download fonts from the internet. You can easily browse Google Fonts from within the app.\nQ: Can I change the system font?\nA: No. Installing a font does not change the default fonts used on your iPad or iPhone. It makes the font available for other applications to use.\nQ: I installed a font, but it does not show up in 'Random App'!\nA: That's not a question! Seriously though, Fonteer makes the fonts available, but it cannot force an app to show the fonts. Try to ask the developer of 'Random App' nicely if he or she can support all system fonts. Your mileage may vary, but developers can be nice people too :-)\nQ: This can never work!\nA: A question is a sentence that ends with a question mark; that bent exclamation thingy. Seriously; this does work. Do not take my word for it. Go install the free version and try it. The free version will allow you to install three fonts.\nQ: I don't get an install button when I tap the attachment!\nA: Make sure to send the email to yourself. Make sure to open the email in the default iOS mail application.\nQ: Help! Something does not work.\nA: Should there still be any issue, do not hesitate to contact me at info@design-luscinia.nl"

Kindle books you have purchased on Amazon will automatically appear in your app. Kindle Unlimited and Amazon Prime members can select and download Kindle books directly in the app.\n\nFIND YOUR NEXT GREAT READ\n• Read the books you buy on Amazon in the Kindle app. Choose from over six million Kindle books (including those with Audible narration), magazines, and comics and start reading in seconds. Explore Amazon Charts best sellers and titles across genres like romance, science fiction, children’s books, self-help, religion, nonfiction, and more—and try any book with a free sample straight from the Kindle app.\n\n• Kindle Unlimited members can enjoy unlimited reading and listening, with the freedom to explore over 1 million titles, thousands of audiobooks, and current magazines. \n\n• Over 1,000 books, magazines, comics, and more included with Amazon Prime.\n\n• Kindle Vella brings you stories released one short episode at a time. The first three episodes of every story are always free--after that, purchase Tokens and redeem them to unlock episodes. Tokens may only be used to unlock Kindle Vella story episodes and are available for In-App purchase. Kindle Vella and In-App purchase of Tokens are currently only available in the US. \n\nGO BEYOND PAPER\nTurn your iPhone or iPad into a book with the free Kindle app—so you can read anytime, anywhere. Explore these reading features in the Kindle app:\n\n• Read your way. Customize your text size, font type, margins, text alignment, and orientation (portrait or landscape)—and choose whether to turn pages from left to right or continuously scroll. Read comfortably day and night with adjustable brightness and background colors. Go to the Aa menu in your book to get started.\n\n• Look up words, people, and places while you read. Breeze through words you don’t know and characters you can’t remember with the built-in dictionary, X-Ray, Wikipedia lookup, instant translations, and search within your book. Simply tap and hold a word to view its definition, or use the Google and Wikipedia links to get more information.\n\n• Track your reading progress. See what percent of the book you’ve read, real page numbers (for most top titles), and how much time you have left in the chapter or book based on your actual reading speed. \n\n• Bookmark places you want to revisit, and make highlights and take notes throughout your book. Open My Notebook to see all your notes in the same place.\n\n• Hop, skim, and jump with Page Flip. Flip between pages or get a bird’s-eye view of your book with Page Flip—don’t worry, we’ll save your place.\n\n• Zoom in on high-definition color images in Kindle books, magazines, comics, and manga.\n\n• Sync your books across devices. When you’re reading a book, the Kindle app will automatically sync where you left off—along with any bookmarks, highlights, or notes—so you can start reading on one device and pick up where you left off on another.\n\n• When you can’t read, listen. Switch seamlessly from reading your Kindle book to listening to the Audible book, all within the Kindle app.\n\n• Get notified when authors you love have new releases.\n\nBy using this app, you agree to Amazon’s Conditions of Use (www.amazon.com/conditionsofuse) and Privacy Notice (www.amazon.com/privacy)."

      "label": "Unlike other techniques, you do not need to \"reprogram\" your brain with various Schulte tables, memory training, vocabulary development, memorizing numbers, etc. Reading speed increases due to the lack of eye movement and focusing of vision in one place. You will see how much you are absorbed in the content of the text, when you realize all the advantages of not having to move your eyes while reading in unnatural directions.\n\nThe speed reading technique, in our book reader Bookva, will help increase the speed reading technique from the standard 250 words per minute, the average person, to 600-700 words per minute, and even more.\n\nReading in Bookva should not create discomfort; if so, then you are using this technology incorrectly. Don't rush to speed up. You will understand when you need to read faster - when you feel that the current speed has become too slow for you. Your increasing speed is the perfect test of reading technique.\n\nThe key to space reading technique and speed is regular practice. Practice every day according to our speed reading method and you will see the first results in a week. Just remember that reading should be fun. And we will take care of \"feeding\" the words to your brain in the form in which it expects to see them.\n\nSupported book formats:\n- epub.\n\nFormats Coming Soon:\n- txt, FB2, RTF, PDF, DJVU, MOBI, AZW3, CBR, CBZ, CBT.\n\nDownload a reader to increase speed reading - Bookva.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.app-privacy-policy.com/live.php?token=BHGpgjxohI3M8jzvtkteI0bNFCI9haax\n\nTerms of use: https://www.app-privacy-policy.com/live.php?token=5gAD833X4nHh7g1vOIEGgVDsQMq10ZJ9"

      "label": "Bible King James Version with Apocrypha\nThe King James Version (KJV), commonly known as the Authorized Version (AV) or King James Bible (KJB), is an English translation of the Christian Bible for the Church of England begun in 1604 and completed in 1611. First printed by the King's Printer Robert Barker, this was the third translation into English to be approved by the English Church authorities.\nJames gave the translators instructions intended to guarantee that the new version would conform to the ecclesiology and reflect the episcopal structure of the Church of England and its belief in an ordained clergy. The translation was done by 47 scholars, all of whom were members of the Church of England. In common with most other translations of the period, the New Testament was translated from Greek, the Old Testament was translated from Hebrew text, while the Apocrypha were translated from the Greek and Latin.\nThe Biblical apocrypha (from the Greek word aπόκρυφος, apókruphos, meaning \"hidden\") denotes the collection of ancient books found, in some editions of the Bible, in a separate section between the Old and New Testaments or as an appendix after the New Testament. Although the term apocrypha had been in use since the 5th century, it was in Luther's Bible of 1534 that the Apocrypha was first published as a separate intertestamental section. Luther was making a polemical point about the canonicity of these books. As an authority for this division, he cited St. Jerome, who in the early 5th century distinguished the Hebrew and Greek Old Testaments, stating that books not found in the Hebrew were not received as canonical. Although his statement was controversial in his day, Jerome was later titled a Doctor of the Church and his authority was also cited in the Anglican statement in 1571 of the Thirty-Nine Articles.\nKing James Version\nThe English-language King James Version (KJV) of 1611 followed the lead of the Luther Bible in using an inter-testamental section labelled \"Books called Apocrypha\", or just \"Apocrypha\" at the running page header. The KJV followed the Geneva Bible of 1560 almost exactly (variations are marked below). The section contains the following:\n1 Esdras (Vulgate 3 Esdras)\n2 Esdras (Vulgate 4 Esdras)\nTobit\nJudith (\"Judeth\" in Geneva)\nRest of Esther (Vulgate Esther 10:4-16:24)\nWisdom\nEcclesiasticus (also known as Sirach)\nBaruch and the Epistle of Jeremy (\"Jeremiah\" in Geneva) (all part of Vulgate Baruch)\nSong of the Three Children (Vulgate Daniel 3:24-90)\nStory of Susanna (Vulgate Daniel 13)\nThe Idol Bel and the Dragon (Vulgate Daniel 14)\nPrayer of Manasses (follows 2 Chronicles in Geneva)\n1 Maccabees\n2 Maccabees\nIncluded in this list are those books of the Clementine Vulgate that were not in Luther's canon. These are the books most frequently referred to by the casual appellation \"the Apocrypha\". These same books are also listed in Article VI of the Thirty-Nine Articles of the Church of England. Despite being placed in the Apocrypha, in the table of lessons at the front of some printings of the King James Bible, these books are included under the Old Testament."

      "label": "This application is the mobile version of the website of the Royal Cayman Islands Police Service (RCIPS). This mobile application, available for iPhone, makes the information on the website easily accessible anywhere. Users will have crime press releases and public safety information, as well as road closure and traffic accident updates, displayed in a readable format on their phones.  Notification options further enable residents to be updated with this practical information in real time.\n\nIn addition to being better informed, this mobile app also empowers the public to communicate with police. The “Submit a Tip” feature is a direct channel for the public to use their phone to send police text, photos or videos of up to 8MB of any information or activity that they think the police should know about. This information can be sent anonymously, but if the sender wants a response there is an option to leave contact information. There is no way for police to determine the sender of this information unless it is disclosed to us in the form provided.  This feature, if widely used, promises an exciting and convenient new way for the community to build a stronger relationship with police and work with us to solve crime and make our islands safer. \n\nThe app also places the names and mobile numbers of our Community Beat Officers at the fingertips of the public through our “Beat Officers” button. An interactive beat map describes the beats around the islands, alongside the photos and contact information the officers assigned to them. A cornerstone of our community policing ethic is to make ourselves accessible and responsive to the community members and their concerns.  This mobile application only enhances this accessibility several times over, and fosters the kind of real connection between officers and community members that can solve crime.\n\nAll other content from the website is also accessible via the app, with an emphasis on making information about careers with the police, as well as practical instructions on administrative matters, easy to find.\n\nIn sum, this is a real tool of information and communication that we feel can be of great benefit to the public as a whole. The RCIPS believes that informed citizens are safer citizens, and strives to earn the public’s trust by keeping the people of the Cayman Islands reliably informed of those happenings in which there is a public safety interest. The RCIPS also believes that the information the community has to share with police is just as important as the information the police have to share with the community. This mobile app will undoubtedly make this communication and partnership stronger, to everyone’s benefit. We urge everyone living on the islands to download this free app and use it to work more closely with us to preserve the safety and security of the Cayman Islands."

First printed by the King's Printer Robert Barker, this was the third translation into English to be approved by the English Church authorities. The first was the Great Bible commissioned in the reign of King Henry VIII, and the second was the Bishops' Bible of 1568. In January 1604, King James I convened the Hampton Court Conference where a new English version was conceived in response to the perceived problems of the earlier translations as detected by the Puritans, a faction within the Church of England.\nJames gave the translators instructions intended to guarantee that the new version would conform to the ecclesiology and reflect the episcopal structure of the Church of England and its belief in an ordained clergy. The translation was done by 47 scholars, all of whom were members of the Church of England. In common with most other translations of the period, the New Testament was translated from Greek, the Old Testament was translated from Hebrew text, while the Apocrypha were translated from the Greek and Latin. In the Book of Common Prayer (1662), the text of the Authorized Version replaced the text of the Great Bible – for Epistle and Gospel readings – and as such was authorized by Act of Parliament. By the first half of the 18th century, the Authorized Version was effectively unchallenged as the English translation used in Anglican and Protestant churches. Over the course of the 18th century, the Authorized Version supplanted the Latin Vulgate as the standard version of scripture for English speaking scholars. Today, the most used edition of the King James Bible, and often identified as plainly the King James Version, especially in the United States, closely follows the standard text of 1769, edited by Benjamin Blayney at Oxford."

Write the conflict of your book in a sentence\nBuild a storyboard for your plot, decide on a book maker or a book creator software.\nSet a daily word count goal - A page a day is just about 300 words. You do not need to write a whole lot.\nSet a time to work on your book writing every day- Uniformity makes creativity and imagination a whole lot easier.\nSet the same place every time when you write a book\n\n* Phase 2 of writing a book: Doing the work\nSet a total word count\nGive yourself weekly deadlines\nGet early feedback - Nothing hurts even worse than writing a publication and after that needing to have to rewrite it since you didn't allow no one has a look at it.\n\n* Phase 3 of writing a book: Finishing\nExactly how do you know when you're done? Short answer: you don't. Not really. So below is what you do to end this book-writing procedure well\nCommit to shipping - Finish the book at all costs.

But without that initial book, you will certainly never learn the lessons you might or else miss out on them.\n\n* The reason most people never finish their books\nEvery year, millions of books go unfinished.

      "label": "The New Living Translation was founded on the most recent scholarship in the theory of translation, with the goal of communicating the meaning of the ancient Bible texts as accurately as possible to the modern reader.\n\nIt seeks to preserve the freshness and readability of the original paraphrase while providing the accuracy and reliability of a translation prepared by a team of 90 biblical scholars.\n\nQuality of Translation:\n\nThe translators took on the challenge of producing a text that would have the same impact in the life of today's readers as the original text had for the original readers. The method employed to reach this goal in the New Living Translation, was to translate entire thoughts (instead of just words) into natural, everyday English. Therefore the NLT is a thought for thought, rather than word for word (literal) translation. As a result, it is easy to read and understand, while correctly conveying the original meaning of text."

      "label": "Short stories with life lessons for kids. Read aloud and the app responds to your words with sounds. For a child, this is a magical audio experience with no screen time.\n\nREASONS WHY YOU’LL LOVE READMIO\n— We help build a positive attitude towards reading\n— We create stories with the intention of supporting the mental and emotional development of children\n— Our stories are short and easy to integrate with other activities\n— Reading with sounds works offline and with your privacy in mind\n— We add new stories every week\n— It’s fun not only for your children but for you as well\n\nBY PARENTS FOR PARENTS\nReadmio is an app full of fairy tales that we have enriched with sounds. Just download the app, save a story to the library and start reading! While you read out loud, the app follows along and adds sounds at exactly the right moment. You don’t have to worry about anything, just read at a regular speed and our application will listen to you and enhance your experience. That’s it. For best results, don’t read too fast and avoid noisy environments (e.g. in the car).\n\nA SMALL THEATRE AT HOME\nFeel free to put even more into the storytelling, our sounds and music will help you. For example, try making different voices or facial expressions and make a small home theater for your children. Your acting performance is very important for the whole experience. Some parents even prefer to use a Bluetooth speaker to make the sounds and music create a colorful atmosphere throughout the whole room.\n\nWHY THERE AREN’T ANY ILLUSTRATIONS IN THE STORIES?\nThe fairy tales have beautiful cover illustrations that will help you and your children choose what you are going to read. However, the children's contact with the mobile phone should end there. In the stories themselves, we did not include illustrations intentionally because we do not want to support their time spent in front of the screen. It is better to draw children's attention to you, the sounds, and the story itself.\n\nMEANINGFUL STORIES\nWe created Readmio because we believe in the power of stories. They form the basis of society and help to spread and maintain wisdom. For children, they are an ideal tool not only for expanding vocabulary but also for explaining complicated topics. We recommend that you use our stories as a conversation starter for topics you care about. You will find inspiration on how to get started in the descriptions of the individual stories.\n\nABOUT PRIVACY\nAn internet connection is required to download the fairy tale, but not for the reading itself. Speech recognition works completely offline on your device. No data or voice recordings are stored or transferred anywhere. Your privacy comes first. In addition, you can read on the go or abroad without worrying about expensive roaming charges.\n\nABOUT OUR SUBSCRIPTION\nReadmio comes with a collection of free stories. It covers multiple categories and age groups providing you with instant value and a great way to try out the experience. In addition to all current and future tales, you get the opportunity to record your reading and create an original audiobook or download the story as PDF and print it. If you like it, the subscription option unlocks the entire Readmio library (currently more than 200 stories). We publish new stories every week.\n\nWe believe that you and your little ones will enjoy the application and have many magical experiences together."

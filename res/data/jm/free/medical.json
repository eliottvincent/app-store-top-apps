A few slide and tap action is enough for logging data.\n\nBlood Pressure Categories:\n\nWhat is blood pressure?\nAccording the National Institute Of Aging, Blood pressure is the force of blood pushing against the walls of arteries as the heart pumps blood. When a health care professional measures your blood pressure, they use a blood pressure cuff around your arm that gradually tightens. The results are given in two numbers. The first number, called systolic blood pressure, is the pressure caused by your heart contracting and pushing out blood. The second number, called diastolic blood pressure, is the pressure when your heart relaxes and fills with blood.\n\nThe blood pressure categories definition is from \n2018 ESC/ESH Guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension: The Task Force for the management of arterial hypertension of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the European Society of Hypertension (ESH)  from \nhttps://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/39/33/3021/5079119\n\nand 2017 Guideline for High Blood Pressure in Adults by American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association\nfrom \nhttps://www.acc.org/latest-in-cardiology/ten-points-to-remember/2017/11/09/11/41/2017-guideline-for-high-blood-pressure-in-adults"

      "label": "The application is based on the scientific research. It helps to determine the fertile days of the month, so you can either achieve or avoid pregnancy. The application uses the date of the last period and shows the date of the next period, the best days to conceive a baby, the ovulation day and when you can avoid pregnancy.\n\n* Scientific Research *\n\nThe popular baby gender prediction method is used by default. But it’s based only on the widely-spread theory by Landrum Shettles. The application also supports the scientific baby gender prediction method. It’s based on the scientific research by Rodrigo Guerrero and the statistics of thousands of women.\n\nYou can change the gender prediction method on the “Settings” screen. But remember that either gender prediction method shows only slightly higher chances of conceiving a girl or a boy and it never guarantees the result.\n\n* Full Version *\n\nThis is the full version of the application. You will be able to see the following data:\n\n- The probability of getting pregnant on the current or on any selected day.\n- The probability of conceiving a girl or a boy using the selected gender prediction method.\n- Chances of getting pregnant during the current period.\n- Chances of conceiving a girl or a boy during the current period.\n\n* How to Use *\n\nTo generate the menstrual calendar you have to provide the following data:\n\n- The first day of the last cycle (select the day and use the button “Add”).\n- Average length of the menstrual cycle (adjust it on the “Settings” screen).\n- Length of the luteal phase (most women can use the default value).\n\nThe application works best for women with regular menstrual cycle. But average cycle length is also a good way to predict when the ovulation should happen."

      "label": "Rhythm modules review ECG rhythm recognition. ACLS Cases is a simulator.\n\nThe new rhythm primer module presents the basics of reading electrocardiograms. The new challenge module provides three fun exercises to reinforce your ability to identify the EKG rhythm. This latest version has improved performance when internet connection is not available.\r\n\r\nECG Rhythms and ACLS Cases will help you pass the American Heart Association Advanced Cardiac Life Support ACLS course. With regular use of ECG Rhythms and ACLS Cases you will maintain your cardiac resuscitation skills so that you will always be ready to serve as an effective leader of the 'code blue' team.\r\n\r\nECG Rhythms and ACLS Cases includes four modules to improve your ability to identify the ECG rhythm and treat the patient. The first module, ECG Rhythm Primer, reviews the basics of identifying the cardiac rhythm in electrocardiogram lead II. It describes the waves, intervals, and a four step method to identify the rhythm. Rhythm Tutor teaches and reinforces the organized four question approach to identification of electrocardiogram rhythms. When you think you have mastered identification of the rhythms in Rhythm Tutor, you should use Rhythm Challenge to test yourself.\r\n\r\nThe Rhythm modules present 80 different electrocardiogram wave forms as they sweep across the screen just like on a real ECG monitor. Recognition of EKG rhythms as the wave forms sweep across a monitor screen is a different skill than diagnosing cardiac rhythms on a static tracing. This app will improve your clinical skills more than reviewing with a book because you will learn to diagnose the EKG rhythms as they dynamically move across the screen.\r\n\r\nAfter you are comfortable identifying the cardiac rhythm, you can use the ACLS Cases module to practice the resuscitation of patients based on the latest ACLS guidelines. ACLS Cases enables you to rehearse megacode management in a realistic screen-based simulator. The current version follows the updated 2015 AHA treatment guidelines. You must evaluate the patient and electrocardiogram rhythm, decide on the appropriate management, and serve as the team leader guiding two assistants through the resuscitation including administration of electrical defibrillation and medications.\r\n\r\nThere are 12 cardiac arrest case scenarios included. The first three cover ventricular fibrillation, the next two are for pulseless ventricular tachycardia, another covers asystole, and the remainder of the cases cover tachycardia algorithms. This app is for training purposes only. Do not assume a real patient will behave exactly the same as any of the simulated patients, however, with regular practice you will always be ready to run a full cardiac resuscitation."

      "label": "*Reach your goals*\n\nStarting to learn anatomy can be overwhelming, but it shouldn't be. Daily Anatomy can be used without any prior knowledge. It starts with the basics, and challenges your brain more and more over time. Learning with  Daily Anatomy is not only about repetition. It introduces information in varying forms. Solving a problem in different ways helps you memorize information longer-term and finally be able to fully absorb it. Whether on your next exam, or in your medical professional career, all the anatomy structures will be at hand. No more thinking. Just knowing.\n\n*What will you learn?*\n\nWith Daily Anatomy you learn all the important structures of human anatomy. This includes bones, muscles, nerves, vessels and specific points on the bones. Each muscle is shown in both its neutral and functional positions so you implicitly learn the main functions as you go along.\n\nInstead of many thin arrows pointing at various structures, each structure is clearly highlighted in its entirety. This way you can easily identify and memorize both shape and location.\n\n*How to stay motivated and not forget*\n\nWhether you need to learn lists of information, or for instance, every muscle and bone in the human body including how they function together, there is a method really works to help you out. The bonus is that this method doesn't stress you out either because you get to take lots of breaks.\n\nIt's called spaced repetition, and it's the way to go for knowledge that sticks in your cranium.\n\nBy using spaced repetition, you work through a series of increasing intervals of time between studying what you've previously learned. This method utilizes the psychological spacing effect, which occurs when you are going back over information that you have already learned in order to remember it better. Spaced repetition works well for lists of items or new vocabularies such as medical terminology.\n\nDaily Anatomy has built-in spaced repetition, so you learn as efficiently and effectively as you can."

This will help you understand the growth of your own baby.\n\nScanBaby is divided into three different modes:\n\n-Scan mode: Here you can scan a baby all by yourself (not your own actual baby). Turn on labelling mode to see all the important structures colored. This way you can compare the ScanBaby image to your own ultrasound image and understand the shown structures better.\n\n-Learn mode: This beautifully crafted mode teaches you about the developmental stages of your child. Get to know all the changes that happen to you and your baby during pregnancy. We have included artfully crafted 3D scans of real babies that you can move around all by yourself and experience how your baby might currently look like. Of course all of these scans come with labelling as well.\n\n-Watch mode: Here we have included many different ultrasound videos you might actually see in a similar way during your own examination. All come with a short explanation what can be seen. Watch a baby dance inside the uterus, play with the umbilical cord and even react to the caressing of the father.\nTerms of use: https://scanbooster.com/index.php/impressum#qx-heading-1479"

Download the FREE app, attempt questions and explore all the unique features (In-App purchase required to unlock the full set of 4600+ questions). \n\nAPP FEATURES:\n* Study Mode (Attempt a question, see answer and the rationale)\n* Create Quiz (Select topic, number of questions - Pause and resume anytime)\n* Time Mode (Answer as many questions as possible in a set time to improve your speed)\n* QOD (Attempt a random question every day)\n* Stats (View details on topics mastered so you can focus on weak areas)\n* Bookmarked and Skipped questions feature allows students focus on specific areas\n* BACK-UP all your stats to a cloud server and RESTORE to a different device\n\nBASED ON:\nLippincott Q&A Review for NCLEX-RN®\n\nDesigned to help pre-licensure nursing students prepare to take the licensing examination. Students and faculty also use the book as a study guide and practice tests for preparing for faculty-made examinations. The book is designed to support the four major content areas in pre-licensure programs: obstetrics, pediatrics, medical-surgical, and mental health nursing. Within each of the four sections, chapters are organized around common health problems. When studying, students can select examinations that parallel the content in a particular course in a variety of curricula. \n\nThis consistently bestselling NCLEX-RN review book features more than 5,000 high-level questions that prompt active learning and higher-order thinking. The questions support the National Council of State Boards of Nursing (NCSBN) 2016 RN test plan and are written in the style used on the licensing examination. Other features include the use of all the types of alternate-format questions found on the licensing examination, detailed rationale for both correct and incorrect answers, information about the NCLEX-RN, study tips, and a \"Content Mastery and Test-Taking Self Analysis\" grid by which students can chart their own progress and modify study plans as needed. \n\nKey Features\nRevision of the organization of the comprehensive tests to include tests of varying length; this will allow students to practice taking shorter and longer tests so they can estimate their concentration and fatigue level.\nAll questions reviewed and updated as needed for appropriateness for Canadian nursing practice.\nGreater emphasis on pharmacology and management of care questions (delegation, prioritization, and leadership), as per the NCLEX-RN test plan.\nAdditional questions about older adults.\nAdditional questions requiring students to make clinical decisions.\nAdherence to the NCLEX-RN 2016 test plan and Practice Analysis (to be released fall/spring 2015).\nQuestions formulated based on frequency of nursing actions as per NCSBN Practice Analysis.\nAdded information on test preparation and study plans; more information on taking computerized tests (a need identified in the Canadian market).\nColor highlights for alternate-format questions to emphasize them for students and potential adopters (students and faculty who want to be assured of availability of these types of questions). As per market review, color highlights will NOT be used in comprehensive exams to simulate more accurately the questions that are NOT highlighted on the actual NCSBN NCELX-RN exam.\nConversion grid from metric to imperial to assist students in both the United States and Canada to become familiar with these differences in measurements; all questions will be written to include both types of measurements.\nContinued use of high-level questions and teaching rationale."

The app will help to track your contractions and determine when it's time to go to the hospital.\nIf you plan on having a home birth, the app will tell you what stage of labor you are in at any given moment.\n\nKeep track of your labor by tapping a single button at the start and at the end of each contraction. The Contraction Timer analyzes the duration and frequency of contractions and will notify you when it's time to go to the hospital.\n\nThousands of pregnant women around the world have become mothers using our app.\n\nAlways consult your doctor to orient yourself in terms of contraction frequency and duration.\nThis app is not a medical device and our recomendations are based on standard indicators. Your labor may occur differently. Therefore, do not rely exclusively on our app.\nIf the duration and frequency of contractions do not yet correspond to the necessary indicators but labor pains become unbearable, it is better to go to the hospital as soon as possible rather than give birth at home or on the way there. Trust what your body is telling you.\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, please email us at neumandev@gmail.com. Your feedback is very important to us."

As seen in Apple’s “Parenthood” commercial, Parents Magazine, USA Today, Good Morning America, The New York Times, CBS This Morning, and more!\n\nKNOW WHAT TO DO NEXT\nOur care recommendations give you peace of mind with age-specific fever and symptom guidance - so you can know when it’s important to take extra precaution or see a doctor.\n\nREMEMBERS FOR YOU\nEasily track temperatures, symptoms and medication for everyone in your family! Remember details such as when symptoms began, how high the fever got, or when to give another dose of medication and share it with another caregiver or your doctor. Temperature data integrates seamlessly with HealthKit and the Health app.\n\nWHAT PARENTS ARE SAYING\n“The app tracks and organizes our family’s temps and symptoms and keeps the history. This is a wonderful app for a busy and sleep deprived mom!” \n“Hands down my favorite feature is that the app gives you suggestions on how to keep your little one comfortable and gives practical advice for a speedy recovery!”\n“The Kinsa app keeps all my data in one place and makes doctors appointments a breeze…”\n“We are a family of 6! Kinsa helps us keep track of everyone’s medical situation!”\n“This has to be one of the best products on the market for families, especially families with little ones!” \n\nThe free Kinsa app works best with Kinsa's award-winning, pediatrician-recommended QuickCare, QuickScan, and Smart Ear thermometers, available for purchase online and in retail stores across the U.S. If you have an older Smart Stick thermometer that plugs into the headphone jack of your phone, please use the Kinsa Smart Stick app instead. \n\nWe hope your family doesn't get sick, but if they do, we'll be there to help your family feel better faster!\n\nAll information, images, and other content shared through Kinsa’s mobile or web applications is for informational purposes only and is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis or treatment from an appropriately qualified and licensed physician or other healthcare provider.

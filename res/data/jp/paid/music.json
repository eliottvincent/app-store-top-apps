      "label": "Sharpen your sense of time! liveBPM is the tempo monitoring tool for drummers, bands and DJs. It detects music and beats via the microphone and continuously displays the current tempo in beats per minute (BPM). It is easy to use and delivers high-quality results while being energy efficient.\n\n\n=== What users said about liveBPM ===\n\n\nJohn Walden, freelance musician and music technology journalist at musicappblog.com:\n\"There are three obvious applications for the app. First, it would make a brilliant practice tool for a drummer, allowing them to monitor just how good they are at keeping a steady tempo without the aid of a click track to guide them. Second, sat beside your kit during a performance, it would allow you to judge just how well you are hitting the ideal tempo for each song in your set. It’s not just drummers that can benefit for liveBPM as the third use is in mapping the tempo – and any tempo changes – in commercial recordings. While this is useful for drummers, it is instructional for almost any musician.\" \n\n\nJonLong:\n\"I used this at my last band practice and wasn't expecting it to work. I couldn't believe how quickly and accurately it started tracking the bpm, even despite the very loud volume of our music.\"\n\n\nPocketDrummer82:\n\"I am a professional drummer and I have been looking for something like this for years! Unless your playing with backing tracks or recording, Playing with a Click is too Mechanical. This app allows the tempo to breathe, and its like a little angel on your shoulder telling you the band is speeding up or slowing down. It is totally worth the money.\"\n\n\nChris Walther:\n\"I have used this about five gigs now and have quit using my previous tempo meter. I used both for a few gigs to test the accuracy. Dead on. Thanks! Every drummer should use this.\"\n\n\nmagrec:\n\"This has been very helpful for recording. thanks!\"\n\n\n\n\n=== Detailed Description ===\n\n\nThis is a tool designed for professional use:\n- Well-tested beat detection engine guarantees trustworthiness\n- Can handle most genres\n- Produces results accurate to within 0.1 BPM under the following conditions:\n-- The tempo is constant or almost constant\n-- Strong impulses are defining the beat (drums, accentuated rhythm instruments like bass/guitar, etc.)\n\n\nFurther features:\n- Tempo curve shows the development of tempo over time \n- Multiple zoom modes to show last 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 20 or 30 minutes\n- Advanced audio spectrum analysis via FFT\n- More accessible and usually more accurate than BPM counters that function through tapping\n- Low battery drain thanks to high performance code and efficient algorithms\n\n\nUsing it as a musician:\n- Use it as an objective tempo reference like a metronome\n- It actually has several advantages over a metronome:\n-- You are not tied to a click, giving you more flexibility\n-- Helps you use tempo changes to enhance your musical expression\n-- With blind tests, it can massively improve your timing confidence, which is especially important if you are in a tempo leading role (e.g. drummer)\n- Discover how/whether your favorite artists use tempo changes\n- Measure and improve your time-keeping skills\n- Identify slowdowns and speedups while practicing your instrument\n- Always be in control of the tempo during your live gigs and rehearsals\n\n\nControls:\n- Power Button: For freezing the tempo curve and minimizing battery drain\n- Clear Button: Clears the tempo curve\n- Slider: Adjusts the target tempo range (i.e. 80-160 BPM)\n- Zoom Buttons: Switch between zoom modes for the tempo curve. (2-30 minutes)\n\n\nNote: \n- You can check and improve the detection by clapping loud to the beat. Also, results can be improved by plugging in a suitable external microphone.\n- You can support my work by rating it on the App Store.

Instead, multiple fine-tuned gates are used to silence unwanted noise.\n\nBrusfri can also be used as a AUv3 plug-in in compatible hosts, for example in GarageBand.\n\n*Brusfri means \"Noise free\" in Swedish.\n\nHere are some examples of sound conditions that Brusfri handles well:\n\n* Guitar amp\n* Noisy vintage gear\n* Boosted pre-amp\n* iPhone/iPad and external mic hiss\n* Room reverb removal\n* Fan noise\n* Background ambiance\n* Mains hum / Electric hum\n\nUsage\n\nIn short, press “Learn” during a couple of seconds of isolated noise to create a \"profile\" for noise. This may be all you need to do.\n\nBrusfri can be used in two ways, either standalone or as a AUv3 plug-in.\n\nStandalone\nImport the audio, either by extracting audio from a video, by importing from iTunes, or by using the “Open In…” option in any other app that can export audio. Press and hold the Learn button (the ear) while playing unwanted noise. (It’s important that the Ear is only fed with isolated noise). When Learn is released, Brusfri will start reducing noise. \n\nAUv3 plug-in\nOpen Brusfri in any AUv3 compatible host.\nFind a region in the recording that only contains noise and play it. \nTap and hold the “LEARN” button for a short while (a second will be enough). When the LEARN button is released, Brusfri will start reducing noise.\n\nThere are a bunch of parameters available that affect the noise reduction algorithm:\n\nATK / THRS / REL (Attack Time / Threshold / Release Time)\nThreshold - basically determines how much noise to be removed. A lower value means more reduction.\nAttack and Release sets the time it will take for the reducer to start working.\n\nLOOKAHEAD\nMakes transient processing a bit smoother.\n\nEDGE\nControls the reduction aggressivity. A lower value gives a smoother reduction.\n\nHPF\nReduces low frequencies.\n\nHIGH\nCompensates high frequencies by boosting them.\n\nMIX\nMixes between dry and noise reduced signal.\n\nNOTE! Brusfri is CPU intensive and iPhone 6 / iPad AIR 2 or better is recommended. When used as an AUv3 plug-in, we highly recommend freezing/bouncing tracks to reduce CPU usage."

There's no need to enter the melody for the entire tune. \nYou just enter one motif and Chordana Composer automatically creates a whole tune, so you don't have to spend ages composing the music.\n\nProduct Features\n\n1. Three ways to enter your motif (2-bar melody)　\n\n　A melody that comes to you in the middle of an ordinary day...\nHave you ever thought: “This would make a really great tune.\nBut I need to know how to compose, and it's no good if I can't read music. And that all takes time to learn”?\nChordana Composer will take care of all those concerns.\nJust enter 2 bars of the motif you thought of.\nChordana Composer will automatically make it into an entire tune.\n　You can choose from 3 types of input method.\nIn \"Keyboard input mode\" you use a virtual keyboard, in \"Notation input mode, you paste the notes into a sheet of music, and in \"Microphone input mode\", you just sing the motif into the microphone.\n\n2. Automatic composition by choosing \"Genre\" and \"Concept\"\n\n　Once you've entered the melody using one of the modes above, you're ready for automatic composition.\nChoose whichever combination of \"Genre\", \"Concept\", \"Range of melody movement\" and \"Level of melody tension\" creates a tune that best matches what you've imagined.\n\n3. Your own editing using the Hints function  \n In Notation input mode, you can edit the the created melody yourself.\nIf you enable the Hints function when you're editing the tune, the notation is color coded as a reference for your edits (notes that match the chord, notes in the same scale, notes that increase the tension and other notes you need to be aware of).\n\n4. Using simple steps, you can upload your finished tune as a video to YouTube along with the staff notation, or slideshow of photos. You can also send your tunes as email attachments in AAC or MIDI format, and it's really easy to make your own ringtones*1 too.\n*1: To use your tune as an iPhone ringtone, you need to connect to a Mac or Windows computer and transfer the tune to your iPhone via iTunes."

You can export your full track, or hit the tape icon and record the live output of the app while you tweak anything on the fly. Both options allow you to capture individual track stems as well!\n\nA performance page lets you trigger your patterns live while controlling a global filter, assignable pitch bends and reverb sends, and a random fill generator.\n\nArtist packs are available in-app at $3.99 or less, which include original sounds and projects from Andrew Huang, Cuckoo, Chuck Sutton, Kilamanzego, Pusher, and more on the way all the time.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- 9 track sampler\n- 4 effects per track: Delay, Filter, Chorus, Bitcrush\n- Graphic EQ per track\n- Monophonic or up to 16-note polyphonic playback per sample\n- Adjustable pitch, volume, playback direction, sample start and stop points\n- 19 automatable parameters per track\n- Independent lengths for each automation lane\n- Automation can be recorded via knob movements or drawn by hand\n- Drum pad and keyboard input\n- Full piano roll with 10 octaves, note velocity, editing tools\n- Randomization over sample selection for quick inspiration\n- Randomization over note position to create surprising variations\n- Drag-and-drop song arrangement page\n- Global reverb with individual track sends\n- Mixing and mastering tools\n- Powerful performance features for creating instant fills, pitch shifts, reverb sends, and global low or high pass filtering\n- Export full track and stems\n- Live recording of performances\n- Metronome with tap tempo and swing/shuffle\n- Ableton Link integration for easy syncing with other devices over WiFi \n- Share projects and sounds via AirDrop, email, etc.\n- Undo and redo"

      "label": "The next evolution in music software. Powerful wavetable sound. \nThe next generation ELECTRIBE produces state-of-the-art dance music.\n\nThe ELECTRIBE series first appeared in 1999. Since then each generation has inherited the iconic, intuitive operability of the original while incorporating the most up-to-date sounds and styles.\n\nThe ease of use, accessibility, sound and musicality of the ELECTRIBE reach new heights in this latest software version which features a powerful wavetable sound source, a “Quick Input” sequencer and a convenient chord pad that allows you to play a chord with one finger. Even if you aren't a musical virtuoso, with ELECTRIBE Wave you can create state-of-the-art dance music like EDM, Future Bass, and Trap.\n\n• Powerful wavetable sound suitable for the latest in EDM\nELECTRIBE Wave has a sound wavetable featuring sounds widely used in the latest music creation. Unlike a PCM synth, the wavetable allows you to repeatedly play fragments of short waveforms, and change the waveform position during playback. By combining the wavetable (which features a rich variety of presets) with a powerful filter and two modulation units, you can create an infinite number of innovative and sharp sounds that cannot be produced using standard PCM synths. Even without a deep knowledge of synthesis techniques, the carefully selected parameters make it easy to craft your sound.\n\n• Improved user interface for quick composition\nThe familiar 16-step pad in the ELECTRIBE series enables speedy rhythm production. The ELECTRIBE Wave also features a new keyboard to play chords and scales. Even without musical knowledge, you can have fun making tracks without worrying about wrong notes. The sequencer features Groove, which can be used to breathe life into rhythm parts, as well as a special keyboard to enable smooth step input for synth parts on the graphical user interface.\n\n• Convenient chord pad that allows you to play a chord with one finger\nELECTRIBE Wave features a chord pad that allows you to play  chords with one finger. If you use the \"Fetch\" function, it will automatically extract the chords from the song that you are in in the middle of creating and assign those chords to the pad for fast and easy song creation. You can also easily assign and save your favorite chords. In addition you can use the arpeggiator to create new phrases!\n\n• Motion Sequence records and plays temporal changes in sounds and effects\nThe ELECTRIBE series introduced a powerful motion sequence function that remembers and reproduces the movements of the knobs. ELECTRIBE Wave now offers this function for the synthesizer/drum parts so you can create a flow of sound overflowing with originality. If you use the built in KAOSS PAD you can change the sound to drastically with a single fingertip, easily storing and reproducing  temporal changes. Remember the wave table POSITION to make real time minute changes to the sound performance.\n\n• Song mode can combine patterns into finished songs\nUse song mode to create a new track by simply arranging the order of existing patterns. Using only the ELECTRIBE Wave, you can take a song all the way from inspiration to completion. With audio file export, you can send a complete song or individual patterns to your favorite DAW, or upload to services like SoundCloud.\n\nMore info at korg.com"

      "label": "Visualize the fretboard, master scales and play through changes like a pro with intervallic functions! \n\n\n‣ Solo is a revolutionary practice tool designed by world renowned fusion guitarists Tom Quayle and David Beebee.\n\n‣ One of the biggest barriers to improvising on guitar is finding and mapping out the relevant chord tones and scales all over on the fretboard in real time.\n\n\nSolo is a highly focussed app for developing your note finding and visualization ability on the guitar. There is no time-based pressure and Solo reduces the cognitive load of having to choose which ‘notes/intervals’ to play. As you get quicker at finding these ‘notes’ you will conversely get better at choosing them whilst improvising. Players of all ability levels will reap huge benefits from practicing with Solo.\n\n\n‣ Using common progressions, Solo presents you with one chord symbol or scale at a time and asks you to find and play a series of notes based on their intervallic function.\n\n‣ Solo listens to the notes you play, analyzes them in real time, and doesn’t move on until you’ve correctly found each note by its intervallic function in the specified order.\n\n‣ This process builds strong fretboard visualization for the most powerful, efficient and malleable way to KNOW your way around the fretboard no matter how difficult the chord changes are. \n\n\nAs a unique and powerful ear training tool, Solo also develops your ability to not only visualize what you’re playing, but hear it in real time too.\n\nIf you know your note names but struggle to learn new scales, play through chord changes or find yourself stuck in pattern based playing, practicing diligently with Solo will be transformational for your knowledge of the fretboard and subsequently your ability to outline harmony when you improvise. \n\n\n‣ CHANGES PLAYING TRAINER\nPractice finding intervallic functions over a series of chord changes based on common and popular chord progressions. Solo is programmed with all the knowledge behind the scenes to understand jazz and popular music harmony and will always pick appropriate intervallic functions based on the harmony of the progression. \n \n‣ SCALE TRAINER\nPractice finding intervallic functions within scales on the fretboard. Solo includes all the modes of the Major, Melodic Minor, Harmonic Minor and Harmonic Major scales, plus pentatonic and symmetrical scales. Seeing and finding scale tones as intervallic functions will transform your ability to manipulate and improvise with scales in real time.    \n\n‣ TUTORIALS\nSolo also includes video tutorials to get you started with intervallic functions, how to find them on the fretboard, using Solo for ear training and how to get the most from your practice time with the app.\n\n\nNo registration or account required."

      "label": "“Nothing sounds quite like a Synclavier”\n\nWorld-class iOS synthesis has arrived! The Synclavier® II helped shape a generation of popular music and film soundtracks. Now this beast of an emotional vintage synthesizer has been incarnated on iOS using much of the core DSP code from the original and keeping the authentic red-button interface that is both deep and immediate.\n\nNot only retro, but decidedly modern: fully compatible with MPE, Ableton Link, Audiobus 3, MIDI. And the included AUv3 client can run inside of iOS DAWs such as GarageBand, NanoStudio 2, BeatMaker 3, Cubasis 3, Auria Pro.\n\nThe powerful Synclavier DSP Engine affords 12 Partial Timbres, Timbre Frames, Samples, FM-Synthesis and Additive-Synthesis methodologies.\n\nIt’s so easy to create playable rich string sounds, fantastic Moog esque drones, Prophet like pads, crazy FM brass noises, or Roland 808 style drum hits. It’s a sound designer’s dream and a synthesist’s wonderland.\n\nBut there’s more! We’ve added a ton of stuff. The original hardware was 8-bit. With newer technology, we can pack more fidelity and more features in this already awesome synth.\n\nMPE compatibility, seven timbre “quick-change” character buttons, 16-track mixing console, crazy-good Artist Preset Libraries from world-renowned sound designers, and lots more. The Synclavier was always a versatile attention-getting instrument, but now it’s a powerhouse synth to be reckoned with!\n\nRelease 1.30 features include -\n• iPad, iPhone and iPad Touch compatibility iOS9 or later\n• 96-button authentic VPK interface\n• AUv3 client compatibility for use within iOS DAWs\n• 16 original “Factory Preset Libraries” (8 banks x 8 entries) - 979 timbres \n• 3 “Artist Libraries” - 127 all-new timbres\n• Sample Library with 116 high-quality soundfiles\n• Audio Setup 44.1/48 kHz and sample latency controls\n• 16-track multi-timbral implementation with mix controls (iPad only, iPhone is mono-timbral)\n• Audiobus-compatible stereo output\n• Meticulous re-creation of the Synclavier FM sound using hardware modelling\n• Soundfile playback, pitch-shifting, looping, and keyboard mapping\n• iCloud compatibility to easily share Timbres (or via Audiobus)\n• iTunes file sharing for backup of user timbres and mixes\n• Direct expression routing for pitch bend, mod wheel, velocity and pressure\n• Full compatibility with MPE interfaces\n• Ableton Link synchronization with Repeat/Arpeggiate\n• 7 character buttons to quickly sculpt any timbre\n• Embedded “Tour” pages detailing setup and operation\n• Library browser for saving and calling up Timbres\n\nSynclavier DSP Engine\n• 12 Partial Timbres\n• Delay-Attack-Decay-Release envelope generators\n• 100 Timbre Frames per Partial\n• Noise Floor and Bit Depth controls\n• Micro-tuning controls\n• Dynamic and Keyboard Envelopes\n• Vibrato and Tremolo LFOs\n• Authentic re-creation of the original instrument and sounds, adjustable from 4-bit grunge to 24 bit silky smoothness.\n\nSynclavier Go! is compatible with all iPad, iPhone and iPad Touch models that can operate iOS 9.0 or later. Soundfile playback and AUv3 compatibility require iOS11 or later. The latest iOS version that is compatible with your device is recommended.\n\nThe Synclavier® knob is as unique today as it was revolutionary at the time of its introduction. The knob is a rate-of-change controller; close your eyes and let your right-brain kick in to the sound design process. Forget the numbers; forget the digits; let your ears guide the process. Sound design with a touch-screen and Synclavier® knob is as different from a mouse-driven GUI as, well, Synclavier® was different than the Fairlight CMI! The Synclavier Knob is an exciting and authentic option, but is not required for Synclavier Go! since a virtual knob is provided in the app.\n\nNote to Parents: Synclavier Go! is as educational as it is historic and authentic. This app can introduce your teenager to the technical aspects of sound and sound design in a fun and informative environment."

      "label": "The Minimoog Model D App is a software transmutation of the world’s first portable synthesizer, the Minimoog Model D®. Anyone can jump in and play with over 160 included presets or lay fingers to the controls and begin exploring vast magical realms of creative potential for iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch and Mac. \n\nThe Minimoog Model D App incorporates a number of inspiring sound creation tools and capabilities not present on its analog antecedent. New functions include the ability to play chords with up to four-note polyphony, an easy-to-use arpeggiator for rhythmic pattern creation, a real time looping recorder with unlimited overdubbing capacity, a tempo-synchronizable stereo ping pong delay module, and the Bender -- a wide-range stereo time modulation effect module. \n\nThe Minimoog Model D App also supports AUv3 Audio Unit extensions, which allows multiple instances of this powerful instrument to be used simultaneously within compatible iOS apps supporting AUv3.\n\nA BRIEF HISTORY \nIntroduced by Moog in 1970, the Minimoog Model D served as the archetype for all electronic keyboards that followed. It gave users the ability to design their own sounds, translating imagination into reality. The Minimoog’s portability, affordability and accessibility made it the go-to instrument for musicians looking to expand beyond the traditional sounds of the time. Bernie Worrell used the Minimoog Model D to establish Parliament Funkadelic’s futuristic funk sound. Kraftwerk employed the Minimoog Model D on the successful concept album Autobahn, sparking an entirely new genre. Gary Numan replaced his live band’s guitars with Minimoog Model Ds, creating the prototype for industrial music. The classic sound of the Minimoog Model D can be heard on Bob Marley’s Catch A Fire, Michael Jackson’s Thriller and Dr. Dre’s The Chronic; Detailed in the mini-doc series “A Brief History Of The Minimoog”. \n\nFEATURES \n• Ships with over 160 presets (hundreds more available in the Minimoog Model D App Store) \n• Up to 4-notes of polyphony \n• Easily share presets and audio recordings with friends \n• Arpeggiator module with note-hold and chord latch capability \n• Stereo ping-pong delay effect \n• Bender time modulation effect \n• Real-time looping recorder with overdub and immediate sharing \n• Selectable envelope shapes and triggering behavior \n• Effortless MIDI CC mapping \n• Seamlessly backup presets to iCloud \n• Play mode for easier panel and keyboard interaction \n• A new take on the classic feedback/overload path \n\nSUPPORTS\n• All 64-bit iOS devices\n• AUv3 Audio Unit Extensions (Including GarageBand)\n• MPE Controller Support \n• Ableton Link \n• Inter-App Audio and Audiobus\n• 7 and 14-Bit MIDI \n• MIDI Program Change Support \n• Bluetooth LE MIDI controllers \n• Share over AirDrop, Mail, or other iOS applications"

      "label": "The legendary ARP sound, exquisitely reproduced in software.\nARP ODYSSEi - A mobile analog synthesizer for iOS.\n\nThe ARP Odyssey of 1972 has earned an unshakable position as a classic analog synthesizer. In 2015, KORG produced the ARP ODYSSEY, a complete reproduction of the original. The ARP genes that shook the worldwide music scene are being passed on, and its history continues.\n\nThe next platform for the ARP ODYSSEY is iOS. We want the unforgettable ARP sound to be easily available on a device that as many as possible of today's players can obtain; this resulted in the \"ARP ODYSSEi\" app for iPad / iPhone. Based on the revived ARP ODYSSEY, we used KORG's proprietary CMT circuit modeling technology to reproduce the analog feeling and sound of the original as closely as possible. We've also given it numerous enhancements that are possible only with software, such as long-awaited polyphony and built-in effects.\n\nThe real analog ARP ODYSSEY, and now the uniquely evolved ARP ODYSSEi, brings the universal fascination and inimitable sound to every device. \n\n* Due to differences in CPU speed of iPads / iPhones, iPad 3rd gen/2/iPad mini/iPhone 4s are not supported, only iPad Air/iPhone 5s or later is recommended.\n\n[ Features ]\n\n- Faithfully models the circuit of the ARP ODYSSEY: The circuitry has been reproduced using KORG's proprietary CMT (Component Modeling Technology), developed over the years starting with the KORG Legacy Collection.\n\n- New functions to create all-new ARP sounds: Added a voice assign mode that allows you to play chords, an arpeggiator that can be programmed in detail like a step sequencer, and effects that can transform the sound in diverse ways.\n\n- Get all three of the sought-after revisions: In addition to the standard design of the Rev3 with its black panel and orange silk-screening, you can optionally obtain the white-paneled Rev1 and the black-paneled gold silk-screened Rev2 designs, together with fifty new preset sounds that take advantage of the distinctive filters of those models.\n\n- Produce music together with KORG Gadget: ARP ODYSSEi can be used in conjunction with the \"KORG Gadget\" music production DAW app that has won numerous awards around the world. If both apps are installed, it can be used as the \"Lexington\" gadget inside the KORG Gadget app.\n\nMore info at korg.com"

When multiple busses are on, each grain is randomly extracted from one of the available sources.\r\n\r\nCheck out www.bleass.com for video tutorials and more info!\r\n\r\n* PLEASE NOTE: this is an Audio Unit Effect plugin (AUv3) which requires a compatible host such as AUM, Audiobus, GarageBand, Cubasis, BM3 and Auria. Multi-bus compatible hosts (AUM & apeMatrix) also allow you to use the audio routing feature. You can also use the BLEASS Granulizer as a standalone App using headphones, a mic or an external sound card."

Silo combines microscopic granulation with macroscopic reverb tails to extract new realms from your existing sounds.\n\nSilo's first section, the granulator, breaks the incoming signal to tiny little bits (called \"grains\") before reconstructing it with massive amounts of control. You can change the speed and pitch of the signal independently and in real-time!\n\nThese grains are then sent to Silo's unique spatializer, which throws the grains all over the stereo field. The spatializer contains a number of motion algorithms to add trajectory to your grains, such as the orbital \"Moons\", the shooting \"Meteors\", or the squirmy \"Biological\". After using this spatializer, you'll never want to use a traditional auto-panner ever again.\n\nFinally, the signal washes through one of Silo's many reverb algorithms, from small, resonant spaces to enormous, booming voids. From \"Bokeh\" to \"Nebula\", each mode can be tweaked to frame your sound perfectly.\n\nAs an AUv3 plugin, Silo has been tested to work perfectly with Garageband, Drambo, AUM, Cubasis, Beatmaker, Nanostudio, apeMatrix, Loopy Pro, and more! Additionally, with its clear layout and smart resizing, Silo can be used on tablets and phones with ease."

      "label": "Unfiltered Audio's Needlepoint is now available on iOS as a Standalone app or AUv3 plugin!\n\nUnfiltered Audio raises the bar (and lowers the tonearm) with Needlepoint: a revolution in vinyl simulation. Continuing the retro themes of their smashed-up hit lo-fi-af, Needlepoint presents a full platter of advanced physical modeling to dive deep into the warm, fuzzy sound of turntable noises and artifacts beloved by many. Of course, since this is an Unfiltered Audio plugin, you can push the needle far past realism and dive into some seriously warped sounds.\n\nWhile many vinyl plugins are content to use looping samples of noise, Needlepoint uses physical modeling to achieve its incredible sound. Needlepoint synthesizes all sorts and sizes of detritus and distress on a record: hair, dust mites, scratches, warping, etc. These are not randomly modeled, but rather accurately distributed onto a rotating, algorithmic platter. Changing the speed of the record can greatly change the nature of Needlepoint's impact on your sound. While you may be used to vinyl RPMs like 33 1/3, 45, and 78, have you ever wondered what it would sound like to tempo sync a turntable to your DAW? Now you can!\n\nBeyond noise, ambience, and tone, Needlepoint includes other effects to fully etch out your vibe. A single knob compressor (inspired by lo-fi-af's PRESS knob with six additional algorithms) can be added before or after the signal chain. This compressor can emulate algorithms from famous hardware samplers associated with vinyl, or even mimic the sound of analog distortion introduced by the vinyl pressing process. A BROKEN mode emulates a broken record a broken record a broken record a broken... Where were we? Oh right, a BROKEN mode acts as an unpredictable looper by jumping the grooves on your recent audio. You can automate the mode's toggle to create all sorts of cut-up and glitchy phrases.\n\nNo vinyl plugin would be complete without a SPINDOWN button that creates that classic vinyl stop (and start!) sound. Here you can control the rate of the spindown to better fit the effect into your mixes. Finally, at the end of the processing chain, Needlepoint features a granular pitch shifter to help you achieve that chopped up vibe without needing to manually change the speed of your tracks.\n\nDespite all of these features, Needlepoint is incredibly easy to use. With a beautiful interface and an extensive set of presets, Needlepoint will help you itch that nostalgic scratch that your tracks need.\n\nAs an AUv3 plugin, Needlepoint has been tested to work perfectly with Garageband, Drambo, AUM, Cubasis, Beatmaker, Nanostudio, apeMatrix, Loopy Pro, and more! Additionally, with its clear layout and smart resizing, Needlepoint can be used on tablets and phones with ease.\n\n(Note for Drambo users: Drambo does not yet have automatic Plugin Delay Compensation for managing plugins with latency. As a result, tracks with Needlepoint will not line up properly with other tracks. An upcoming patch for Drambo will add this feature in.)"

All sorts of hazards are present here, from a skipping CD stutter effect to a multimode bitcrusher.\n\nFinally, the rich, colorful analog section adds that vibe that you crave. A maximizer, a tape saturator, a noise generator, an analog-style filter, a pitch warbler, and a radio demodulator all work together in harmony to toss your sound into the past.\n\nBut wait!

In this manner, you can sidechain-compress your pads or bassline against a 1-measure pattern, no other inputs required. \n\nWith an easy-to-understand interface, Pumphouse is a quick method for getting That Sound. \n\nPumphouse requires transport information to work. Please note that some iOS AUv3 hosts do not have a transport. (At this time, Auria Pro that we're aware of.) There is an Inter-App Audio version supplied, but it also requires transport info. \n\nWe have tested and approve the AUv3 with AudioBus 3, Cubasis, GarageBand, AUM, ModStep, Zmors Modular, and Beatmaker 3."

Nearly a decade of AudioGate innovation has been used by KORG to create the finest high-resolution music player: iAudioGate.\n\n* The functions for iAudioGate's DSD playback may be limited by each iOS device. Be sure to confirm “DSD format Compatibility Charts” before you buy.\n* The software converts sound to 44.1kHz or 48kHz when iPhone plays back independently.\n\nKORG was one of the first to realize the potential of high-resolution audio sound, delivering DSD (Direct Stream Digital) in a series of acclaimed recording and playback products.

You can record up to 6 seconds via microphone or copy samples via iTunes.\n\n\nShare\n\nWith nanoloop for iPhone, you can send your saved projects to other nanoloop users and your own PC via e-mail. If nanoloop is installed on the recipient's iPhone / iPod, she/he can simply tap on the file name in the received e-mail to start nanoloop and import the attached file so that it is available for editing. This makes collaboration very easy, multiple users around the world can work on the same project by simply e-mailing the file.\n\n\nExport\n\nSongs can be exported to a WAV file that is accessible via iTunes (simply drag & drop files in finder). The exported file is also copied to the clipboard so that it can be pasted in other apps that support pasting audio. If a file sharing app like Dropbox is installed, you can upload the file there.\n\nMore information can be found at the nanoloop website: www.nanoloop.com"

      "label": "Been saving up for that Hang, but don't have quite enough yet? You can get busy on our version of the infamous steel instrument. Start it up, bang away, even record your own loop to play along with.  So authentic, your friends will think yours has already arrived. Fill them in on the secret, and they too can download and record their own creations.  Do I hear a \"Hang out\"???\n\nFeatures include:\n* Audiobus 2 support including state saving\n* 45 tunings including microtonal tunings \n* Sounds sampled from actual instrument\n* Loop recording and playback\n\nLittle bit of information about the Hang ... The Hang is a steel percussion instrument that is typically played using the hands and fingers while it rests in the musician's lap.  It was developed in Switzerland in 2000 by  Felix Rohner and Sabina Schärer.  There are currently 5 generation models.\n\nOurs is a first generation Hang that defaults to the Aeolian tuning with a D3 central note and a A3 C4 D4 E4 F4 G4 A4 tone loop. The eight notes are arranged in a 'Tone Circle' that zig-zag from low to high and are harmonically tuned around the low 'Ding' note in the center.  Select from 45 tunings including microtonal tunings.  These various tunings can be mixed into loops that are being constructed.\n\nMany thanks and kudos to Felix Rohner and Sabina Schärer for creating such a unique, elegant, and fun instrument.  For more information about the origin of the Hang, to hear some sound samples, or just to see someone kickin' it, visit one of the following:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hang_(instrument)\nhttp://www.hangdrum.info\n\nThe loop recording in all of the OddTunes apps is roughly modelled after the Gibson / Oberheim Echoplex Digital Pro.  While there are only a few buttons, there is much more functionality there than meets the eye. For more information on the operation of the looper, please visit our Web site at the following address:\n\nhttp://www.avacata.com/iphone/oddtunes/hang/\n\nOddTunes:Hang is one of the many fine instruments coming your way from the Avacata iPhone development team.  Stay tuned for new upcoming OddTunes releases and additions to the loop recording capabilities.\n\nFrom one musician to another ... it's Hang time. Ding, Ding, Ding.\n\n========================\n\nComing soon: \n\n- Save your loops.  Share your loops.  Amaze your friends.\n\n- New tuning packs (we've kept track of all of your requests and have a few of our own)\n\n- MIDI support (in and out)\n\n========================\n\nAlso, check out Avacata's game: Bishook.

EarGuru helps you do it with three independent modes, each targeting a specific area.\n\nIn LISTEN mode, EarGuru plays a group of notes, all different, and you try to identify them from lowest to highest. Beginners will want to start with 1, then move to 2. Experts can go all the way to 11 notes if they choose to.\n\nIn PLAY mode, EarGuru plays a note, or a chord of up to 4 notes, and you play it back as quickly as possible on your instrument before it moves on to the next one. \n\nIn SING mode, EarGuru asks you to sing a note, and as you're singing, EarGuru plays the note so that you can make sure you've sung it correctly and in tune. \n\nAll three modes can be used without looking at the screen, using the CONTINUOUS PLAY mode. \n\nThis app relies on you, as a serious musician, to self-evaluate. If used regularly, it can completely transform your hearing."

This download includes an AUv3 App Extension for use in AUv3-savvy hosts like AUM, AudioBus, GarageBand, Cubasis, and Auria Pro. Also included is a stand-alone application with Inter-App Audio. \n\nEos 2 consists of four high-quality custom-designed reverb algorithms, made with the modern production environment in mind. Three different plate simulators and our own Superhall algorithm give you a broad palette of reverb, and the easy-to-understand interface makes adjusting the algorithms to suit your track incredibly simple. \n\nWant a traditional dark plate reverb? Eos 2 can do that. How about a short, dense room sound for your drum buss? Not a problem. But where Eos 2 really comes in to its own is when you drop Superhall on your piano or synthesizer tracks. The incredibly long modulated hall sounds of Eno-style ambience are where Eos 2 thrives, something that is not possible with convolution 'verbs. \n\nFeatures\n\n> Four reverb algorithms designed for Audio Damage by ValhallaDSP, including three separate plate algorithms and our own unique SuperHall, a rich, densely modulated, extra-long hall algorithm designed for ambient and synthesizer music. \n\n> Full control over the reverb early reflections and tail, with modulation and equalization control, to sculpt the density and tonal characteristics to your needs. \n\n> All presets from the desktop version included, and you can even share presets among all versions of Eos 2 using the copy/paste mechanism. \n\n> AUv3 and IAA standard. \n\n> Note that Eos 2 is a dense, heavily modulated algorithmic reverb, and as such may be somewhat heavy on the CPU, especially on older devices. For best results, use a single instance as a send."

      "label": "This metronome app is created by a musician for musicians. Almost all metronome apps boast about their accuracy, but users with sensitive hearing notice inaccurate beats all the time. It used to be impossible to create a perfectly accurate metronome on a mobile device. Despite the failure of other apps, perfect time is possible for TrueMetronome: its unique engine creates perfect beats with ABSOLUTE ZERO error. For this reason, TrueMetronome is the most accurate metronome app on any mobile platform.\n\nSound quality is the second issue for software metronomes. Serious musicians prefer a natural sound filled with overtones, but all metronome apps play short synthetic samples (so that the first sound stops completely before the next begins). Thus, you hear an artificial, dead sound. Moreover, the identical samples playing at the same frequency can drive any man crazy! TrueMetronome solves this problem thoroughly: all sounds are recorded from real metronomes, a beat does not affect the gradual decay of its predecessors, and each beat's sound is a little different from the others. All this contributes to the natural sound which is easier on your ears.\n\nFinally, an aesthetic, thoughtful interface is an important aspect of any application, and TrueMetronome pays particular attention to it. Creating an electronic metronome interface is simple, but TrueMetronome does not cut corners: it recreates the look and feel of a real mechanical metronome; every mark on the scale is labeled with a tempo mark, the deviation angle of the pendulum depends on the tempo, and the tempo is selected by dragging the weight.\n\nYou can adjust the tempo in 2 BPM (beats per minute) increments by dragging the digital weight. This restriction prevents a change of tempo from accidental touches, and when you need greater precision in the selection of the tempo, there are \"+\" and \"-\" buttons as well. On the lower part of the metronome, you can turn the bell on and off and select the number of beats per measure.\n\nTo start or to stop the beats, simply tap anywhere.\n\n-------------------------------------\nKey features\n-------------------------------------\n- Perfect beats with ZERO error (unparalleled!)\n- Natural sound without duplicate samples (unique to TrueMetronome!)\n- Realistic look and feel with particular attention to comfortable usability\n- Optional bell on the first beat of the measure\n- Selection from all known meters: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13\n- Tap tempo function\n- Skins"

      "label": "Lemur is the world's best MIDI/OSC controller for iOS. Benefiting from nearly 10 years of development, Lemur is synonymous with multitouch music control. All these major artists can't be wrong: Daft Punk. Björk, Plastikman, CHVRCHES, Glitch Mob, Sub Focus, Max Cooper, Barker & Baumecker, Orbital and many more. \n\nVersion 5.0 introduces the incredible new Canvas object and the Sequencer family of features with rock solid timing.\n\nCanvas — Canvas is a brand new object that lets you script custom widgets with full multitouch support. The object is adapted from the HTML5 Canvas element, which means you can design widgets featuring complex shapes, animation, shadows, and transparency  The Canvas object opens the door to a completely new Lemur experience, where the appearance and behaviour of objects can be designed to precisely match the demands of your project. Polygons, waveforms, circular objects and infinitely more are all possible with Canvas.\n\nSequencer — Lemur 5.0 introduces a family of new features for tight sequencing. This includes three new objects: StepNote, StepSwitch and StepSlider. Each of these provides a different flavour of sequencing and is ready to use right out of the box. The objects do the hard work for you, simply add them to your template and they are ready to control your MIDI instruments. \n\nIn App Editor — Design your templates on the fly, without a computer in sight. The In-App Editor, available on iPad only, makes multitouch control truly improvisatory by letting you shape your controller the same way you shape sounds. Virtually every function of the desktop editor application is now available through an intuitive system of iOS menus and widgets. Best of all – it’s easier to use than ever. This means a much smaller learning curve and an immediate initial experience. Any basic configuration, such as a typical bank of faders, can now be created with a few familiar taps and gestures. And any factory template can be adjusted quickly to suit your particular needs.\n\nSkins — Lemur features three new skins, in addition to the classic look. Choose the look that fits your style and get inspired.\n\nLiveControl 2 — Experience the ultimate Ableton Live controller, designed in partnership with master designer ST8. Improvise a riff on the Play page, then switch to the Sequencer page to edit the pattern. Choose a key and scale to guide your melodies and use Quick Chord to instantly create harmonies. Use the Modulate page to flawlessly map any parameter from any plugin to the MultiBall object and take advantage of Physics, LFOs and gesture recording. The Launch page gives you everything you would expect from a clip launcher, and more. We even integrated snapshots and morphing.\n\n\nREQUIREMENT (for the Lemur Daemon): \n- OS X (Intel only) 10.5+ \n- Windows (XP SP3 or 7 recommended)\n\nThe In App Editor feature is accessible only on iPad devices.\n\nCONNECTIVITY\n\nSimply connect your iPad/iPhone to your laptop over Wi-Fi and make the connection! Lemur also supports CoreMIDI allowing you to use hardware interfaces such as Alesis' iO Dock or the iConnectMIDI or class-compliant USB MIDI interfaces (with a camera connection kit). You can even control up to 8 computers from one iPad with Lemur!"

You can even make your own exercises. I wish you could undo a note entry in the melodic exercises, a lot of the times iv just pressed the wrong note because of my fat fingers but I guess it’s part of the challenge to not make a mistake(wish you could change it in the settings or something). Still a must buy for ear training.\n\nGuy *****\n\nYou guys deserve 1000000 stars thank you\n\nEverything You Need ****\n \nIt took a while for me to appreciate this app. It wasn't until I had a bit of ear training done that I could see the limitations in other apps and how this one would take me further and teach more of what I could actually use versus simpler apps. Once I could hear intervals up to an octave and major vs minor chords, this app had plenty more for me to study. Great app.\n\n----\n\nListening is the most important skill in music, and this app will help you to listen better. \n\nEar Trainer is an educational tool designed for musicians, music students and anyone interested in improving ones musical ear. It has over 260 individual exercises that are conveniently placed into nine different areas of study. It is also possible to create custom exercises so that you can practice exactly what you need.\n\nNo need to be an expert, Ear Trainer is suitable for all users from beginner to very advanced. No matter what level your musical hearing skills are, Ear Trainer will help to hone them.\n\n* Built-in Exercises *\n\n- Interval Comparison (48 different exercises)\n- Interval Identification (30 different exercises)\n- Chord Identification (48 different exercises)\n- Chord Inversions (24 different exercises)\n- Chord Progressions (25 different exercises)\n- Scales (24 different exercises)\n- Note relative to chord (18 different exercises)\n- Relative Pitch (12 different exercises)\n- Melody Exercises (38 different exercises)\n\nEach exercise has a short description of its purpose and optional preview. A virtual piano keyboard and note view in each exercise helps you visually understand and analyze the notes that have been played. To aid your progression you can compare the different options after answering. (You can even play the virtual piano if you like!)\n\nAs you work through the exercises, statistics are collected so that you can see your progress.\n\nThe questions in the exercises are randomly generated so you can do them over and over again as many times as you like to continue to hone your skills.\n\n* Custom Exercises *\n\nUsers can create their own custom exercises to match their desired areas of study and/or skill level. The following areas are available for custom exercises:\n\n- Interval Comparison\n- Interval Identification\n- Chord Identification\n- Chord inversion\n- Chord Progression\n- Scale Identification\n- Note after chord \n\n* Share Custom Exercises *\n\nCustom exercises can be shared with friends and class mates through Email, AirDrop and iMessage.\n\nWhat our users says:\n\n------\n***** Must Have!!!\nThis is the best Ear Trainer of all I tried in App Store, everything works just perfectly. If you are interested in improving your musical hearing you must have it.\n------\n***** Amazing\nI have been using this app every day for just about a year now and the result are simply amazing.\n------\n**** I'm in my second third semester as a music major and I have to say, this is a great app for any music major, or anyone looking for ear training. I like that I'm able to switch between different instruments, it makes hearing the notes on the instrument you're use to a bit easier for me.\n------\n\n\nFor more information please see: www.dev4phone.com"

Sweep generation with In App Purchase\n\n** Spectrum  **\n\nFFT (Fast Fourier Transform) is used to calculate the frequencies in the Spectrum Analyser and these are displayed in real time. The frequency is displayed in either logarithmic or linear scale.\n\nThree FFT sizes of 8192, 4096 and 2048 are selectable, giving fine resolution of frequencies. Interpolation gives resolution to within 1Hz.\n\n 6 different FFT window function types can be selected - Hamming, Hann, Rectangular, Bartlett, Triangular and Blackman.   \n\nNumber of FFT windows can be selected from 1 through 4.\n\nThe strongest frequency is displayed both above the peak, and optionally, in a large number display in the center of the screen. The large number display can be quickly switched on or off by double tapping the screen. \n\nThere is a screen capture facility in the Spectrum Analyser allowing you to save the spectra  for future reference along with details of the FFT parameters, time and date.  \n\nA single tap freezes the screen. Other features such as screen capture and double tap to toggle large number display still work during the freeze. This feature can be turned off in preferences if it’s not desired. \n\n** Scope ** \n\nThe display of the Scope can be adjusted easily using pinch gestures in both horizontal and vertical directions. Zero crossing detection of the waveform provides a smooth display and can be set to either positive or negative direction zero crossing.\n\n  There is a screen capture facility in the Scope allowing you to save waveforms for future reference. \n\n** SPL Meter ** \n\n The SPL Meter continuously displays the sound pressure level using an A-weighting, and has resettable minimum and maximum displays also. \n\nSPL Meter can be calibrated against a reference standard or meter.\n\nSPL Meter has a continuous ticker style trace of the SPL over time. \n\n** Signal Generator ** \n  \nThe Signal Generator has 3 different output types: \n\n- Sine wave \n- White noise \n- Pink noise \n\n The output of the Signal Generator can be viewed on the other parts of the App.  \n\nThe sine wave frequency selected using picker wheels allows for accurate control of frequency to within 1Hz. Volume for the sine wave and noise signals is continuously adjustable.  \n\nWith an In App Purpose one can add a sine wave sweep generator functionality to the Signal Generator. The sweep generator can sweep increasing and decreasing frequencies, and using either a linear or log sweep rate.\n\n**Settings  **\n\nAll of the user preferences in each of the above applications can be made persistent between restarts of the App. \n\nAll parts of the App have direct access to a help document. \n\nAudio Kit - essential for those working in audio, sound and music."

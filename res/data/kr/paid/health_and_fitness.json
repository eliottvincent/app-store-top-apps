AutoSleep will track your sleep & quality and send you a notification in the morning.\n\nEven if you don't wear your Watch to bed, AutoSleep can track your time in bed. It's extremely simple. If you DON'T wear your Watch to bed, then simply take your Watch off before you go to sleep. As soon as you touch your iPhone or put your Watch back on in the morning then AutoSleep will know that you have finished sleeping. \n\nAs everyone is a little bit different. AutoSleep provides a simple setup wizard and an option to tweak if you are a very restless sleeper. \n\nAutoSleep also works with HeartWatch our premier heart & activity monitoring app and writes your Sleep information to Apple Health. \n\n*Requires Apple Watch running WatchOS 4 or higher.\n\nAwards\n-----------------\nBest of 2018\nhttps://apps.apple.com/story/id1438574124/\n\nBest of 2019\nhttps://apps.apple.com/story/id1484100916/\n\nBest of 2020\nhttps://apps.apple.com/story/id1535572713/\n\nBest of 2021\nhttps://apps.apple.com/story/id1591083005/"

I love this app so glad I found it \nnauf4l: was planning to buy a 100$ jump rope which counts skips as i always do 5k skips a day. So after a month was considering this when i came across this app after installing 5 apps of the same.Glad i paid about 2$ for this as it is totally worth it. \nFrankWurst: Accurate jump counter based solely on Apple Watch. App integrates into My Health and Activity App seamlessly. Great product.\ntafty：I enjoy the skipping experience with this app. And it syncs well with Apple Watch\n\nContact me\nE-mail:89208242@qq.com\nTwitter: @haozes\nTelegram Group: t.me/yaoyaonow  \n\nDesign by Haozes\nThanks for the translation: 橙子、金小粉、孟金羽、蔡沛森、Adgar, Fabio Carrilho, Tomás Feliú Ribeiro, Francesco Tirsi, Leonard Pitt Diehl, Zhimin Yang, Massimiliano Benini,Radu Ionescu,Andrés Leon,Dikran Jessaijan, Krishna"

      "label": "• TennisTension is the FIRST WORKING mobile app that instantly measures the momentous string tension of a tennis racquet with extreme  consistency and accuracy. We, the developers,  GUARANTEE  full satisfaction if you trust and buy TennisTension. The error of the measurements is less than 0.2 kg. Tracks the TENSION LOSS. It records and analyzes the ringing sound heard from the strings when they are hit with a stiff object (pen, pencil, another racquet, fingernails etc.).\n• Systematically tested with different racquets and strings by players at different level of play - from beginners to ATP professionals.\n• At ATP Sofia 2019 in January, 3 from the seeded players tested, approved and gave recommendations for improvements, which we implemented: string pattern, hybrid stringing, string opening size influence, noise disruptions. \n• If the user defines accurately all parameters of the tennis racquet and its string, then the error of the measurements will be less than 0.2 kg.\n• Parameters to preset: head size; string pattern; main and cross string thicknesses and types; string opening size; stringing type. If some of them are not defined, the app will use the average default values or the last values the user put.\n\nUse the \"Calibration\" to cope COMPLETELY with all specific characteristics of every racquet, string and stringing machine/stringer combination.\n\nInstructions for use\n\n- The user has to learn how to produce the proper ringing sound close (2 to 10 cm) and in front of the phone microphone. Find the microphone which uses single, very small hole either at the top or at the bottom of the phone.\n- Remove the dampener - if you have. \n- Tap the racquet string very gently several times every 1 or 2 sec. with a stiff object. The best way is with pen or pencil, or use another racquet, fingernails, etc.\n- While ringing, the resonating racquet string must stay 2 to 10 cm from the microphone, in front of it, especially in a noisier environment.\n- To receive the exact momentous string tension, define all the necessary racquet and string parameters. If you don't know some of the them, default average values are taken for the calculations, or the last values that the user put it in. \n- TennisTension measures the average tension between main and cross strings of the racquet (for example, if a racquet is strung 25/24 kg, the measurement result will be 24.5 kg).\n- String tensions of hybrid strings could be measured as well.\n- The error of the measurement result is less than 0.2 kg.\n- Calibration is provided, though it is not necessary to make it."

      "label": "AutoWake is the first haptic smart alarm for your Watch. \n\nIt can wake you up by tapping you on your wrist using your Watch's haptic engine. You can set it to wake you if you are in light or medium sleep either 15 or 30 minutes before your set alarm time. This helps you feel more refreshed. \n\nThere's an optional sleep cycle buster that you can turn on to give you a light tap at 5 minute intervals in a 15 or 30 minute window before your alarm to take you gently out of deeper sleep. \n\nNot only that but it will even automatically measure your waking pulse just before the alarm sounds, which is a valuable measurement of recovery.\n\nIf you ignore the alarm on the Watch, you can also set a safety alarm that will play on your phone. This will speak and/or play a chosen song from your music library. \n\nThere's also auto scheduled alarms in case you forget to set your alarm before bed. \n\nIf you use AutoSleep our auto sleep tracker, you can use the new ultra smart alarm features. You can now be woken up after a desired amount of sleep, quality sleep or when your sleep bank is back in credit. You can use this in conjunction with a latest wake time if required. You can even set a bedtime reminder that looks at your required sleep, sleep efficiency and latest wake time to give you a reminder for the optimal time to go to bed. \n\nWhen you turn on your alarm, it can automatically tell AutoSleep that you have gone to bed so that time to fall asleep can be tracked.\n\nIf you use Apple HomeKit then you can run scenes for key events in AutoWake like turning off your bedside lamp and setting your room temperature for sleep. \n\nAutoWake requires an Apple Watch running WatchOS 4 or higher. Advanced features requires WatchOS 5.\n\nAutoWake works fine with Do Not Disturb and Theatre/Cinema mode. \n\nAutoWake requires at least a bluetooth connection between your iPhone and your Apple Watch during the time that you are asleep. You can use Flight Mode on your iPhone, but make sure that you turn on bluetooth.\nIf you user Screen Time, make sure that AutoWake is in your exclude list.\n\nAs with all of our apps, there is no tracking, no analytics, no snooping. Your privacy is very important."

      "label": "As featured in the book Beyond Training by Ben Greenfield.\n\nAs featured in the podcasts:\n- Harder to Kill Radio 026\n- Ameer Rosic Optimal Health Show #58\n- Ben Greenfield Fitness #263\n\nCNS Tap Test is an adaptation of the Finger Tap Test (FTT) or Finger Oscillation Test (FOT) which  is used  to measure the status of the central nervous system (CNS), and is one of the most commonly used tests in neuropsychology, because of its simplicity and reliability, and because it generates relevant data about fine motor control, which is based on motor speed as well as kinesthetic and visual-motor ability.\n\nThe application should be used on a regular basis to determine an athlete’s baseline. If the CNS Tap Test result is elevated it is suitable for a  maximum effort or a heavy lifting day. If the CNS Tap Test result is lower than average it may indicate CNS fatigue and impending sickness, injury or over-training.\n\nBoth hands should be tested on a regular basis in a consistent environment, typically every morning on waking. The procedure for testing is:\n\n - Rest hand palm down on the heel of the hand on a flat surface\n - Tapping is done with the index (pointing finger), and all other fingers remain on the flat surface\n - The timer starts with the first tap\n - When the timer expires no further taps will be accepted\n - The result can either be saved or discarded.\n\nMultiple samples can be saved per day.\n\nThe resulting data can be graphed, emailed or managed from within CNS Tap Test.\n\nUsing Swift Charts for improved accessibility and legibility."

Go to > Health app > Browse > Heart > Hear Rate Variability.\n\n***Get Notified***\nHRV Tracker makes spotting changes in your HRV easy by monitoring your HRV measurements in the background and showing notifications after your HRV drops under or rises above your desired levels. HRV Tracker will monitor changes in individual measurements and also your 24 hour HRV average. You can change the default notification levels directly in your Apple Watch app. Please note that notifications can get postponed for example because of a low battery level.\n\n***Apple Watch for daily tracking***\nBrowse through last seven days of HRV measurements by using the digital crown. See how measurements compare to your seven day period and individual days. By tapping the graph you can toggle through the first values of each day. Use complications on your Apple Watch to stay informed on changes in your HRV. \n\nBesides the automatically recorded HRV measurements you can use the Breathe app on your Apple Watch to record new HRV measurements. Start a Breathe session in the Breathe app and after the session ends a new HRV measurement will be available in HRV Tracker.\n\n***Compare HRV to other key metrics***\nFind possible causes for changes in HRV by using the comparison graphs available on your Apple Watch:\n-Sleep hours: By default HRV Tracker will use sleep data provided by sleep apps that add sleep data to HealthKit. If no sleep data is available HRV Tracker will calculate estimated sleep hours per night (estimated sleep time will only be available in the Apple Watch app)\n-Activity: By default HRV Tracker will use your Active Energy (calories) as the activity metric. In the HRV Tracker Apple Watch app you can choose to use a custom activity score that emphasizes the intensity of daily activity.\n-Daily resting heart rate (RHR).\nToggle between comparison graphs by tapping the upper part of the screen.\n\n***Follow Long-term HRV trend***\nFollow your long-term HRV trend on your iPhone and compare your short term measurements to all-time data.\n-Select week from weekly graph to see daily HRV values of the selected week.\n-Browse through all daily HRV values of the selected day\n-Compare daily HRV averages to other relevant daily metrics: Activity, Sleep (if available in the Health app) and Resting Heart Rate\n\n***Widgets on iPhone***\n-Medium sized widget with chart showing all daily hrv values\n-Multiple small widgets to choose from\n\n***Privacy***\nData read from the Apple HealthKit database is only used to show information related to your Heart Rate Variability. Information read by HRV Tracker is only stored and used locally on your iPhone and Apple Watch. \n\n***How is it measured***\nHeart rate variability measurements used by HRV Tracker are calculated by measuring the variation between individual heartbeats. Your Apple Watch automatically measures your HRV in the background and stores the outcome into HealthKit. HealthKit uses SDNN heart rate variability, which is calculated using the standard deviation of the inter-beat (RR) intervals between normal heartbeats (measured in milliseconds). Besides background measurements generated automatically by your Apple Watch you can use the Breathe app on your Apple Watch to generate new measurements."

      "label": "RowedBiker can make your indoor rowing workouts more interesting by connecting your Concept2 or WaterRower to workout games like Zwift and training applications like The Sufferfest. It works by emulating a smart cycling trainer, like a Wahoo Core, or a smart treadmill, converting your rowing power into cycling wattage or treadmill belt speed so you can enjoy the virtual workout worlds and training plans that are available to cyclists and runners.\n\nRowedBiker has a couple of features that make it easier to row with cycling or running apps: \n\n- Cruze and Power Reserve Modes\n\nCyclists and runners can easily grab a drink or chat with the workout group. For rowers, it can be a challenge to grab that drink or type a message without dropping the handle and losing the peloton or workout group. \n\nTo help, RowedBiker has a Cruze mode that temporarily locks your power to a certain level, similar to the cruise control in an auto. Use it whenever you need to stop rowing for a moment. You also have the option to \"bank\" power before you need it using the Cruze Reserve to maintain workout integrity.\n\n- Erg Mode Support\n\nWorkout games offer structured workouts that move between different power levels. Erg mode automatically changes the Cruze set point whenever the workout game requests a new power level. If the game requests a higher level than your current rowing output, Cruze will withdraw from your Cruze Reserve while you ramp up the wattage. If the game drops the requested power level, you'll accumulate reserve power while you are coasting down. There is an option in Settings to disable or adjust how closely Cruze follows erg mode requests.\n\nThanks for checking out out RowedBiker. We hope it helps you reach your fitness goals, and have some fun in the process!\n\nFor more information visit: http://rowedbiker.com. \n\nSupport: http://rowedbiker.com/support\n\nPrivacy policy: http://rowedbiker.com/privacy\n\nFollow us at: https://twitter.com/exerscreen\n\n\"RowedBiker,\" the rowing biker logo, and \"Cruze Reserve\" are trademarks of Charlotte Intellectual Properties, LLC.

You can save your results for future reference, keep track of multiple people with individual profiles, add notes and locations, and even print out your measurements for sharing or safe keeping.\n\nCardiograph uses your device's built-in camera to take pictures of your fingertip and calculate your heart's rhythm - the same approach used by professional medical equipment!\n\n\"I know you have the disclaimer on the screen but I don't care, Cardiograph saved my life. Your app was key to understanding what was going on and help the doctors understand too.\"\nBob Spadafora - *****\n\n\"Comparing heart rates with family over the holidays is fun.\"\nTxyak – ****\n\n\"Wanna impress a friend with a cool app. This is the one to get.\"\nMattyray – *****\n\n\"After having two heart valve replacements and a by-pass, I feel it is not only smart - but also necessary - to have such a reliable heart rate monitor with me everywhere I go.\"\nDantv – *****\n\n\"I am an EMT and it helps me actually see what is going on. It is by no means definitive like a monitor but it is a great indicator of problems I would not see otherwise.\"\nGranniem – ****\n\n\"I had a pulse oximeter on one hand, medical quality, and my iPhone app in the other and the app was dead-on accurate.\"\nLike it but hate it – *****\n\n\n=== See Cardiograph in action ===\nhttp://macropinch.com/cardiograph \nhttp://youtu.be/isIjcCFYEho\n\n\n• Measure your heart rate\n\nIt's never been easier to know what your heart rate is! Without any external hardware, just using the built-in camera of your smartphone or tablet, you can get accurate readings almost instantly.\n\nKnowing how fast your heart is beating can be very useful when exercising, if you're under stress, if you have a heart-related medical condition, or even just out of curiosity.\n\n\n• Track your results\n\nEvery measurement you take is saved to your personal history, so you can keep track over time. In addition to the date and time of the measurement, you can also save the location at which it was taken (and see them on a map), and even add a quick note to effortlessly organize your history.\n\n\n• Multiple profiles\n\nCardiograph is perfectly tailored to allow multiple people to use the app on a shared device. You can create profiles for each of your family members or friends, and each of them has their own individual measurement history.\n\n\n• Export & Print\n\nEach measurement can be exported in full detail to a portable format that you can later send via e-mail, upload on the web or even print right from the app itself (with an AirPrint™ compatible printer).\n\n\n• Clean and intuitive design\n \nInspired by real-life medical equipment, Cardiograph is a pleasure to use. The streamlined and clutter-free design makes it seem instantly familiar, so you can focus on using the app instead of navigating through series of confusing screens.\n\n\n• Built-in user guide\n\nIf you're having trouble with the app, or you want to make the most out of it, you can access the comprehensive help manual right from within the app itself.\n\n\n• Universal application with iCloud® sync\n\nCardiograph is an universal application - it runs on the iPhone, the iPad, and the iPod touch.\nInstall Cardiograph on multiple devices with iOS 5.0+, and all your profiles and measurements will be in sync! Manage your profiles and measurements on one device, and the changes are instantly reflected on all the others.\n\n\nPlease note: If your device doesn't have a built-in camera flash, you need to take your measurements in a well lit environment (bright sunlight or close to a light source).\n\n\nFollow the latest news:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/macropinch \nhttp://twitter.com/macropinch"

Unlike binaural beats.\n\nMindwave 2 tones have been meticulously designed to produce the greatest neural response during EEG tests.\n\nBinaural beats are great and they work for most people but we found that other methods tend to be more effective and more flexible, such as Isochronic tones.\n\nTechnical Description of isochronic beats:\nIsochronic tones are regular beats of a single tone used for brainwave entrainment. The interference pattern that produces the beat is outside the brain so headphones are not required (use with a dock), but since isochronic tones are more pronounced, the stimuli is even stronger with the use of headphones/ear buds."

The app does this by way of prewritten workouts which are often general and aim to improve all trainable grips on the board. Some are specific (2000 series only at the moment) which aim to improve, sloper strength, pocket strength and crimp strength. \n\nThere is also a new custom workout program fully adjustable and includes the 1000,2000 and micros, so if you have your own hang regime and different timings then that is all programmable and can be saved.\n\nBoth the workouts and custom timer now record hang contraction time (time spent actually hanging off the board) We recommend most users get up to around 20:00 minutes on this clock whilst doing their workouts.\n\nOn the Workout screen after you've selected your work out it is now possible to adjust set and hang times. Users who are only finger boarding and are having a rest day prior to and after training may wish to do up to 3 sets and 7 hangs. Other users may prefer to go for 2 sets and 6 hangs, this is what we'd consider an average and more suited to people doing additional types of training.\n\nPlease note the grades for the workouts aren't actually meant to relate to anything other than themselves. E.G. 5c is easier than 6a but harder than 5b. If you find 5a hard on the 1000, use a weight removal technique such as putting one foot on a chair in front of the board or using a pulley with weights on. More advice on this and other things are available in the general advice section on the Workout Ratings page.\n\nTo record your hangs press the record button (red circle icon) whilst resting. The Workout Ratings function is much improved and should now be a really useful training aid which records gradual progress and improvement.\n\nFingerboard gains take time, remember to warm up thoroughly and move on to more difficult hangs at a slightly slower pace than you think you should to give pulleys time to catch up with muscles. For example 10% strength gains over a year is brilliant improvement. 5% is still effective training.\n\nBest of luck with the training, happy hanging and we hope this helps with the motivation."

      "label": "Are you trying to quit smoking? If you are finding it hard to stop smoking, QuitNow is made for you.\r\n\r\nFirst things first: you know smoking is bad for your body. Even so, lots of people keep smoking. So why should you quit? When you quit smoking, you improve the quality and length of your life and the lives of the people around you. One way to prepare to successfully launch your smoke-free life is to power up your phone with QuitNow.\r\n\r\nQuitNow is a proven app that engages you to quit smoking. It aims to avoid tobacco just by giving you a picture of yourself. Quitting smoking is easier when you focus your effort on these four sections:\r\n\r\n- Your ex-smoker status: When you quit smoking, the focus has to be on you. Remember the day you quitted and get the maths: how many days are you free of smoke, how much money you saved, and how many cigarettes you avoided.\r\n\r\n- Achievements: your quit smoking motivations: As with all tasks in life, quitting smoking is easier when you divide the task into small and easy ones. So, QuitNow offers you 70 goals based on the cigarettes you avoided, the days since your last cigarette, and the money saved. So, you will start celebrating achievements from the first day.\r\n\r\n- Community: the ex-smokers chat: When you quit smoking, you need to stay within the non-smoking areas. QuitNow offers a chat full of people that, like you, said goodbye to tobacco. Spending time with nonsmokers will make your way easier.\r\n\r\n- Your ex-smoker health: QuitNow offers a list of health indicators to explain how your body improves day by day.

Most quitters look for tips on the internet, and there are lots of fake tips there. We researched in the World Health Organization archives to find the investigations they made and the conclusions they had. In the Frequent Asked Questions, you will find all the answers to those questions you have about quitting smoking.\r\n\r\n- The QuitNow bot: sometimes, you have strange questions that don’t appear in the F.A.Q. In those cases, you can ask the bot: we train her to answer those strange ones. If she doesn’t have a good answer, she will contact the QuitNow crew and they will update their knowledge base, so she will learn the best answers to your questions. By the way, yes: all the bot answers are extracted from the W.H.O. archives, as the F.A.Q. tips.\r\n\r\n- Books to quit smoking: knowing some techniques about quitting smoking makes the task easier. There's always someone talking about books in the chat, so we made an investigation to know which are the most popular, and which ones can actually help you to quit smoking for good.\r\n\r\n\r\nDo you have any idea to make QuitNow even better? If so, please do write to us at ios@fewlaps.com\r\n\r\nTerms of Service: https://tos.quitnow.app/eula\r\nPrivacy Policy: https://tos.quitnow.app/privacypolicy"

However, in fact, repeated contraction of the urethral or anal sphincter does not help to strengthen the pelvic diaphragm.\n\nNew Kegel Exercise is a new way of Kegel Exercise, and anyone who understands the principles of New Kegel Exercise can do Kegel Exercise correctly. \n\n◆ PC Muscle Exercise  \n\nPC Muscle Exercise consists of repeatedly stretching and relaxing the pubococcygeus muscles. \n\nIt helps to prevent and treat urinary incontinence, fecal incontinence, constipation and levator ani syndrome.\nEspecially when you have constipation, you can easily expel feces by stretching both pubococcygeus muscles during defecation.\n\n◆ Prostate Exercise  \n\nProstate Exercise consists of repeatedly stretching and relaxing the levator prostatae muscles which attach to both sides of the prostate.\nIt also repeatedly stretches and relaxes both ischiocavernosus muscles which are involved in penile erection.\n\nProstate Exercise improves the circulation of the prostate, so the prostate becomes healthy and helps to prevent and treat benign prostatic hypertrophy(BPH) and premature ejaculation.\nAnd it will make your erection harder and longer.\n\n◆ Prostate Orgasm Exercise \n\nProstate Orgasm Exercise consists of repeatedly stretching and relaxing the levator prostatae muscles which attach to both sides of the prostate.\nIf you repeat Prostate Orgasm Exercise, it increases the blood flow to the prostate, causing the prostate to become swollen, and you will experience dry orgasm.\n\nProstate Orgasm Exercise is not just for sexual pleasure.\nProstate Orgasm Exercise improves the circulation of the prostate, so the prostate becomes healthy and it is particularly effective in preventing and treating benign prostatic hypertrophy(BPH) and premature ejaculation.\nIt can also be expected to help prevent prostate cancer.\n\n◈ Developer Profiles\n\n-Kiwon Cho M.D. \n-Ph.D. in Anatomy\n-Board Certified General Surgeon\n-Director of the Kegelise\n\n※ This app is provided by streaming media services.\nTherefore, the video may be loaded slowly or can not be played when the network is in poor condition.\nIn these cases, please convert the network settings from Wi-Fi to LTE / 4G.\nIf the video still does not play properly, move to a place where the network is in good condition and try again."

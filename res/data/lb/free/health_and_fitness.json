When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features.

You can create different equipment profiles for all the places that you workout: at home, in a hotel gym, outdoors e.t.c\n- Motion Captured Motions: We also have a library of exercises that were recorded using a real personal trainer wearing a motion capture suit. This allowed us to precisely record the movements and transfer them onto our 3d models, allowing you to see the exact form and timing of the exercise.\n- Detailed Exercise Descriptions: Read exactly how to do any exercise with advanced tips and breathing techniques\n- Workout Tracker : Accurately track all your workout sets in a gorgeous easy to use interface.\n- Progress Section : Track your progress and analyse your workouts with progress analysis charts\n- Apple Health Integration - This app integrates with the Health app. Connect GymStreak to the Health app and track your workouts and progress. \n- Automatic Workout Periodization : GymStreak automatically adjusts the weights you lift, reps, distance, time & rest times workout after each workout to improve the effectiveness of your workout plans.\n\nWe’ve built automatic workout periodization into every generated workout plan, meaning that using GymStreak, you will keep your muscles constantly surprised, allowing you to make progress at a much faster rate than you would on a standard workout program...and the best part is that GymStreak does all the tedious work and calculations for you, all you have to do is just follow the program.\n\nWhat is Workout Periodisation?\n\nPeriodizarion is a research tested approach to training used by athletes & other physical competitors of every kind. Research has shown progress improvements of up to 2.5x* in the speed of progress when a periodisation program is utilised vs a standard program that most people do. \n\nIt involves intelligently adjusting how much you lift with every workout, as well changing up the exercises that you do and how you do them.\n\nGymStreak, takes care of all of this for you, helping you get results faster than ever before.\n\n---------------------\n\n*Research Source: Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise Journal  (2011)\n\n\n-------------------------\nSubscription Information \n-------------------------\n\nAll GymStreak AI users can use the app for free by signing up to a free trial period.

      "label": "- WHAT IS LOÓNA?\nloóna is the first app that lets you quickly disconnect from a long stressful day and get in the right mood for sleep.\n\n- SO, IT'S ANOTHER SLEEP APP, RIGHT?\n Not exactly. loóna isn’t a list of direct go-to-sleep techniques, but rather a mood-altering app that helps you to stay calm during the day and prepares you emotionally for going to sleep in the evening.\n\n- WHY IS BEDTIME MOOD IMPORTANT?\nNegative emotions we accumulate during the day are processed and consolidated by our brain during sleep making them more difficult to disassociate from when faced again in the future. Moreover, feeling angry, anxious, down, or, the opposite, excited, and elated, is likely to affect latencies to sleep onset and REM-sleep. People mistake it for the symptoms of a sleep disorder, but in reality, they just may be in the wrong mood for sleep.\n\n- HOW DOES LOÓNA WORK?\nFrom the wake up and during the busy day Loóna will support your emotional states with playlists and immersive stories. Each night you’ll have a recommended sleepscape. A sleepscape is a guided session that combines activity-based relaxation, storytelling, and sounds in a unique way. Complete it to shut the frantic world out, reset your mind, and create the perfect mood for sleep.\n\nLoóna saves your sleepscape sessions to your Apple Health app.\n\nThe upgrade to loóna PLUS provides access to the entire collection of sleepscapes. Our subscription options are: 1-month subscription for $12.99, 1-year subscription with a 7 day trial for $39.99 (price may vary by location).\n\nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal. Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nTerms of service: http://loona.app/terms\nPrivacy policy: http://loona.app/privacy"

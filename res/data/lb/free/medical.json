      "label": "What is Vaporizing Moxibustion?\r\nVaporizing Moxibustion is a unique therapy which I invented by risking our family lives. It is the last and only hope to cure all diseases. Vaporizing Moxibustion is a combined therapy which mainly use moxibustion. It is based on the trapped waste theory and disease model.\r\n\r\nMy story\r\nMy daughter start treating rhinitis when she was two years old. After treated by all kinds of therapies, her health is becoming worse and worse. She got fever more and more frequently. On Feb.1st，2019, my daughter is 9 years old and just weighed 20 kg. She was having high fever of one week without sleeping, eating, drinking, urinating and bowl movement. And she cannot take any medicine anymore. Her mum was so desperate and want to sucide with our child. She said, \"Mum, I dont want to die.\" We thought to try moxibustion. But we were not sure if it will work or not. My daughter was afraid and refused to try. Her mother tied her hands and feet to force her to do moxibustion. She cried and said feeling hot. The temperature was even higher. After a night moxibustion, the fever was gone. She said \"Mum, I am hungry.\" I knew that her life was saved. Since that day, she never stopped moxibustion even a day for more that 3 years. She never go to hospital again. I finally find the disease root cause is trapped waste,which are from all things we have eaten. And it can never be solved by eating medicine. On the contrary eating more will cause more waste. I finally invented Vaporizing Moxibustion therapy, which cured my family and myself. We also cured a lot of mistreated patients.\r\n\r\nWhat disease do we cure?\r\nNo matter mental disease, psychological disease, cancer, or any strange rare disease, after starting moxibustion,although going through expelling waste effects and suffer some side effects, all patients finally will get better and better. They never go to see doctor again.\r\n\r\nIs there any side effect or risk?\r\nVaporizing Moxibustion has no risk itself. during the treatment some symptoms may become more serious. Some new symptoms may appear. The potential body risk may be danger to cause unpredicted death.Although the death risk is very low. If patient can survive the treatment, all the symptoms can be sure cured. Patient should consider all these difficulties.\r\n\r\nCan I treat myself at home?\r\nEverybody can do Vaporizing moxibustion at home by yourself with the 1v1 guide on this platform. You need feedback everyday on the platform to adjust the therapy.\r\n\r\nHow long does it take to cure?\r\nThe trapped waste is accumulated in our body for years. The time to cure depends on the body waste level. Everybody has many symptoms. Some symptoms may take ours to recover. Some symptoms may take months. Most symptoms may need several years. During the treatment the symptoms will be changed in curve path before cured.\r\n\r\nHow to judge that I have trapped waste?\r\nYou can observe your tongue. For a waste trapped body your tongue will be big, tooth print, thick greasy tongue coating. The tongue like being immersed in dirty water. So is the same with your organs, which will cause the organ functions abnormal. Also you will find that your nail vertical lines. Your skin is dark dirty. Your hair is dirty and scurf. Every part of your body can find the sign of the trapped waste. The human body is a organic system. All kinds of diseases and symptoms is not independent. They have the same root cause.\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\nDisclaimer:\nUser take all responsibilty and risk for the treatment. Please consult doctor before start treatment."

The app will help to track your contractions and determine when it's time to go to the hospital.\nIf you plan on having a home birth, the app will tell you what stage of labor you are in at any given moment.\n\nKeep track of your labor by tapping a single button at the start and at the end of each contraction. The Contraction Timer analyzes the duration and frequency of contractions and will notify you when it's time to go to the hospital.\n\nThousands of pregnant women around the world have become mothers using our app.\n\nAlways consult your doctor to orient yourself in terms of contraction frequency and duration.\nThis app is not a medical device and our recomendations are based on standard indicators. Your labor may occur differently. Therefore, do not rely exclusively on our app.\nIf the duration and frequency of contractions do not yet correspond to the necessary indicators but labor pains become unbearable, it is better to go to the hospital as soon as possible rather than give birth at home or on the way there. Trust what your body is telling you.\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, please email us at neumandev@gmail.com. Your feedback is very important to us."

      "label": "*Reach your goals*\n\nStarting to learn anatomy can be overwhelming, but it shouldn't be. Daily Anatomy can be used without any prior knowledge. It starts with the basics, and challenges your brain more and more over time. Learning with  Daily Anatomy is not only about repetition. It introduces information in varying forms. Solving a problem in different ways helps you memorize information longer-term and finally be able to fully absorb it. Whether on your next exam, or in your medical professional career, all the anatomy structures will be at hand. No more thinking. Just knowing.\n\n*What will you learn?*\n\nWith Daily Anatomy you learn all the important structures of human anatomy. This includes bones, muscles, nerves, vessels and specific points on the bones. Each muscle is shown in both its neutral and functional positions so you implicitly learn the main functions as you go along.\n\nInstead of many thin arrows pointing at various structures, each structure is clearly highlighted in its entirety. This way you can easily identify and memorize both shape and location.\n\n*How to stay motivated and not forget*\n\nWhether you need to learn lists of information, or for instance, every muscle and bone in the human body including how they function together, there is a method really works to help you out. The bonus is that this method doesn't stress you out either because you get to take lots of breaks.\n\nIt's called spaced repetition, and it's the way to go for knowledge that sticks in your cranium.\n\nBy using spaced repetition, you work through a series of increasing intervals of time between studying what you've previously learned. This method utilizes the psychological spacing effect, which occurs when you are going back over information that you have already learned in order to remember it better. Spaced repetition works well for lists of items or new vocabularies such as medical terminology.\n\nDaily Anatomy has built-in spaced repetition, so you learn as efficiently and effectively as you can."

Supports twins!\n\nBeing a FTM (first-time-mom), or mom in general, is very tiring and challenging! You’ve just made it home from the hospital, exhausted and overwhelmed by your new responsibilities, and need a little help. Don’t worry! In the first few months of your baby's life, it really revolves around eating, sleeping, diaper changes and occasional little doctor's visits. As a new mom, it’s not always easy to remember the last time you fed your baby or changed their diaper. We don’t blame you for falling asleep on the couch occasionally, so we’ve got you covered with handy alarms and reminders. Alarms and graphs are a great way to have an at-a-glance look at what you need to do without stressing over \"what if I forget?”.\n\nOur app will help you keep track of feedings, your baby’s weight and how long they were eating to make sure they’re gaining weight properly and at a normal rate. Unfortunately for some parents, it’s imperative that they track every last drop of food their baby eats since some infants are born with illnesses that make it harder to gain weight normally. Keeping track of diapers is also imperative to keeping your baby healthy. Everyone needs an easy way to check how often they’re changing diapers, and if everything looks normal during each change.\n\nJust click the appropriate button at the beginning of the feeding and other activities. Your baby care history will be reliably stored. All this information may be useful when you visit the pediatrician, as well as for the further development of your child.\n\nCheck your baby’s day to day activities easily and efficiently. This baby care app will help you keep track of everything in one convenient place and help moms take care of themselves by having a peace of mind.\n\nEmail us your comments and suggestions, and we'll implement them as soon as possible!\n\nGOLD STATUS IN THE APP\n- You can subscribe to regularly updated backup and synchronization with relatives\n- The subscription costs $2.49 per month, $11.49 per year, $4.99 and $9.99 for lifetime\n- Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n- Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal\n- Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase\n- Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n- Private Policy - https://wachanga.com/privacy\n- Terms of Use - https://wachanga.com/terms"

Over 1,000,000 people have downloaded our mobile electronic eye charts for iOS. \n\nThis version is our best for iPhone, and it's now completely free.\n\nUseful for:\n- Triaging\n- House visits\n- Patients who have memorized the office chart\n\nFeatures:\n- Randomizable Snellen Chart\n- Randomizable Tumbling E Chart\n- Randomizable Sloan Letters Chart\n- Randomizable Landolt C Chart\n- Randomizable Near Vision Chart (w/subscription)\n- Line Isolation (w/subscription)\n- Amsler Grid (w/subscription)\n- Single optotype charts (w/subscription)\n\nDescription:\n\nEyeChart is a pocket vision screener: randomized Snellen, Sloan, Tumbling E, and Landolt C charts to offer a rough but useful screen of visual acuity. Simply press a button to randomize the entire eye chart, or touch an individual line of the chart to randomize that line. Swipe right for the chart selector.\n\nEye care professionals around the world use Snellen Eye Charts to measure visual acuity. However, patients often memorize the classic Snellen chart, leading to less accurate vision measurements. Enter EyeChart! Though this unique, pocket-sized randomizable eye chart should not be used as a primary visual acuity measuring tool, it can provide a handy rough vision screen when a chart is not available, or it can be used to complement static, wall-based Snellen charts.\n\nSubscription:\n\nIn addition to our free features, EyeChart offers a subscription to exclusive paid features, including the Randomizable Near Vision Chart, Line Isolation, Amsler Grid, and Single Optotype Charts! The subscription costs $0.99 per month of access, and is available through an auto-renewing subscription which will renew each month for your convenience until you choose to turn it off. Please let us know if you have any questions about your subscription at eyechartapp@gmail.com.\n\nCheck out our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy at eyechartproapp.com/termsofuse.\n\nEyeChart was made with the best of intentions, and we hope to continue improving it.

Normally, your body forms new cells as you need them, replacing old cells that die.  Sometimes this process goes wrong.  New cells grow even when you don't need them, and old cells don't die when they should.  \n\nThese extra cells can form a mass called a tumor.  Tumors can be benign or malignant.  Benign tumors aren't cancer while malignant ones are.  Cells from malignant tumors can invade nearby tissues.  They can also break away and spread to other parts of the body.\n\nThis useful app discusses the most common cancers that affect people and is ideal for all medical professionals, medical residents and interns, nurses, medical students,  and of course curious lay people who just want to learn more about cancers.\n\nLegal disclaimer: The content on this application is presented for informational purposes only.

Beginning with the patient’s presenting symptoms, they ultimately narrow down multiple options to one condition.  The DSM-5 Differential Diagnosis Handbook can play a critical role in this process by improving the diagnostic process of psychiatric conditions.  Leveraging latest DSM-5 classifications from the American Psychiatric Association, users are able to use a trusted 6-step process when dealing with, sometimes unfamiliar, psych conditions.  \n\nExclusive, integrated interactive decision trees provide a step-by-step process of asking yes or no questions to find a tentative diagnosis.  When the initial diagnosis is reached, tables of differential diagnoses are presented to help confirm or present new options.  \n\nFEATURES\n• Interactive decision trees for narrowing down psychiatric diagnoses\n• Algorithms for enhanced assessment\n• The latest DSM-5 classifications and ICD-10 codes\n• Helpful tables of differential diagnoses\n• Detailed entries featuring definitions for each psychiatric condition\n• Expansive guidance on all 6 steps of the differential diagnosis process \n• Advanced Search to help find topics quickly \n• “Favorites” for bookmarking important entries\n\nAuthor: Michael B.

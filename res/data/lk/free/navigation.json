When you go over a preset speed limit, the large digits change colour from green to red and the device emits a loud sound to alert you! Great for avoiding speeding tickets!\n\n‣ Easy to set and configurable speed limits \nSet speed limits with 4 fast and configurable presets. Presets only need a single tap and are the safest way to set the limits! \n\n‣ S.O.S. Flat tyre or worse? \nOur speedometer shows your current location and you can share it easily (sms/text, email) with car assistance services, ambulance or friends. \n\n‣ Know your car's limits ! \nDoes your car become sluggish on those steep climbs? Is it possible you got too high in mountains ? Our built-in altimeter will provide you with accurate readings that indicate your height over sea-level. \n\n‣ In a dispute for speeding?\nGPS Black box gives you point by point time, speed, location and altitude data for the last 20 minutes of your travel. You can email its data as an excel or csv file. Or you can surely switch it off or reset at any moment.\n\n‣ Need to know where you are?\nIntegrated map shows your location and a tracking \"tail\" behind you.\n\n∙∙ UNIVERSAL APP. Speedometer for iPhone and 3G-iPads. Retina graphics included. \n\n∙∙ 000-999 SPEED AND LIMIT RANGE. MPH, KMH AND KNOTS. Maximum, average speed, distance traveled. \n\n! You can use this app on your iPhone 3GS, 4, or 4S as well as on any iPad with 3G. **App will not work properly on iPods and wifi only iPads as they don't have GPS chip (External GPS module is required).\n! Please note that as with all GPS apps, continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. \n\nDrive safely and avoid paying those speeding fines! Our speedometer is the ideal watchdog companion no matter what journey you are going on!\n\nFull version of the speedometer gives you ability to work in background, GPS tracking, waypoints, trip cost computer, Siri shortcuts for applying speed limits and controlling track recording, 100+ customization options and more. Be sure to check it out in the AppStore!\n\n* A bit of instructions: If speedometer doesn't show you the speed, just be sure to be under the open sky to have GPS signal. Under the open sky, within 5-10 seconds GPS indicator will become green and speedometer will start showing the speed.\n** If you wonder why gps speedometer may show 3-5 mph (3-8 kmh) less than a car's speedometer, you can take a look here: http://goo.gl/wtLvT (tomtom's discussion thread).\n*** And here is an amazing article http://goo.gl/p5zfMi explaining why GPS might show you 80ft (or -80!) altitude when you are laying on the beach. Don't throw the app or iPhone away just because of that! :) Let us use the article's last sentence here: \"Those who use GPS altitude to aid in landing their small plane should have their insurance policies paid up at all times\"."

This app will quickly find the location of another phone by sending a text message request. Most phones manufactured after 2010 can accept this request, no need to install any additional app on the 2nd person's phone. It does not get any easier than this!\n\nHow it is working:\n\n• User A wants to know a User B location.\n\n• User A enters the phone number of User B into the app.\n\n• The app generates a unique URL, and the URL is sent to User B.\n\n• If User B clicks on the link, user A will see the location of user B.\n\nLimitations:\n\n• This is not a spy app. User B must agree to share the location with you.\n\n• If User B has a device without GPS (desktop computer, tablet), the determined location may have a large accuracy margin (up to 5 km).\n\n• In rare situations, when user B is behind the corporate proxy, the app can show the proxy's location, not the user's.\n\nThe user location is determined in three ways:\n\n• E.123, E.164\n• RIR\n• W3C Geolocation API\n\nAuto-renewing subscription:\nTitle: Full Access 1m\nLength: 1 month\nPrice: $1,99 (check the price in the app)\n\nEULA:\nhttps://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/\n\nPrivacy Policy:\nhttps://www.codeesteem.com/apps/phone-location/PrivacyPolicy.pdf"

That’s why we design CroPlus with the most secure and anonymous functionalities.

Your Ip address will never be tracked.\n\nBut be aware that CroPlus includes a remote connection to a Cloud system from which you will be able to run a Midori web browser.

This is Smarter Subway.\nThe \"Smarter Subway\", which has been loved by many users steadily since its first appearance on February 17, 2011, was reborn in December 2017 with a new look.\n\nCheck out the latest subway map and latest timetable from the new Smarter Subway to the metropolitan area (Seoul Subway, Gyeonggi Subway, Incheon Subway) / Daejeon Subway / Daegu Subway / Busan Subway / Gwangju Subway!\n\n1. Conveniently search for subway stations and routes\n\n• Station name search - If you do not know the location of the station you want to find on the subway map, you can search for the station name and find it. \n• Quick Search - This function allows you to quickly find routes by combining station search and route search. You can set your favorite \"station\" as a departure / arrival station for convenience. \n• Recent Search - Allows you to search back to the most recently searched route.\n\n2.

You can also check out various restaurants, coupons, job information and weather information around the station.\n\n3. We recommend the best route according to the user's situation\n\n\"Smarter Subway\" has increased convenience by introducing a dynamic result screen that allows you to change the route from time to time in the Route Results screen instead of the static result window. In the route result, you can select again the departing station, the arrival station / day / time, and you can check the previous / next train of the searched route immediately.\n\n4. We will inform you of the express subway route conveniently.\n\nIn the meantime, users really gave a lot of opinions about the inconvenience to the expressway route map. We have added a detailed view of the subway line express to see at a glance what kind of express trains exist for each subway line, which express train stops at which station, and when the express train departure time is at the station.\n\n5. National subway information\n\n(Seoul, Gyeonggi, Incheon) Subway Line, Busan Subway Line, Daegu Subway Line, Daejeon Subway Line, Gwangju Subway Line\n\n[Optional Access Guide] \n- Location: Checking current location and surrounding station\n- You can use the service even if you do not agree to the optional access right.

Information is updated every ten seconds without need to refresh page or relogin to account. Monitored data contains vehicle status, latitude, longitude, altitude, address, speed, connection time, ignition status, fuel consumption, sensor data, nearest geozone and much more.\n\n- Widgets display recent object information which is updated every ten seconds without need to refresh web page. Send commands to control device, view recent events and mileage graph.\n\n- Events is one of the most important feature which our software offers. Events are used to trigger actions by important or disruptive activities. Customer will get instant SMS/E-mail/Push notifications triggered by different event types.\n\n- History shows all stored data which server has collected from connected devices for chosen period of time. Software stores information received from GPS tracking devices, such as speed, time, location, stops, reports, events, etc. History is displayed in different ways: visually on the map, in a graph or HTML/XLS format.\n\n- POI (Points of Interest) allow you to put markers at the locations that might be interesting or useful. You can also name the place, add short description, attach an image or even video to it.\n\n- Routes feature is a helpful tool to mark an important section of the road by drawing virtual path on the map. Additionally, get notifications if vehicle is within or out of route. This feature is useful to analyze vehicle dependency to the road.\n\n- With geofences you are able to make a virtual perimeter on geographic areas that have specific interest for you. The main reason to have geofences is to control whether the unit stays within it or not, so that when the geofencing unit enters or exits the area a notification is generated.\n\n- Get detailed reports about trips, mileage, driving behavior, fuel usage and thefts, activity in particular zone or route. Reports are used for data analysis of particular vehicle or entire group. Reports can be exported or sent instantly to E-mail addresses in HTML/PDF/XLS format.\n\n- Tasks make it easy to create and manage entries related to upcoming work which should be accomplished. Set start and end address, priority, task status.\n\n- The Maintenance schedule reminds you when you should have your vehicle serviced, such as an oil change or technical inspection. It can also serve as a reminder to take out insurance.\n\n- Use the Expenses function to track the amount spent on an object maintenance. Evaluate the economic benefit of vehicle usage with the Expenditure report on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis."

If all of your family members install the iMapp application, you will be able to know not only their current geolocation, but also the places in which they have visited during the past 60 days.\n\nInstall iMapp and you will be able to:\n\n• track the location of your friends and relatives connected to the service \n• find out the location of any person; regardless of whether they have the app on their device installed (targeted devices should support HTML5)\n• view the time list of location(s) of your friends for last 60 days\n• get notifications when your friends arrive or leave from the places that you have created\n• control the battery level of your friends and family's phones\n• get directions to your friends, events, or any other places that you wish\n• create your own places on the map\n• share your location with your favorite friends in automatic mode\n• use the program for tracking locations of children and relatives\n• send the coordinates of a selected location using the most convenient way\n• use the most energy-saving technology of location tracking.\n\nThe accuracy of coordinates whilst searching for devices using phone number or email depends on the availability of built-in GPS/GSM/WiFi modules on the targeted devices. In the case that there is no GPS, the coordinates are detected according to the data of cellular networks, with the accuracy ranging from 100 to 1000m. If there is no GPS and GSM, then the coordinates are detected via IP address. This function works by sending a unique message - that the app generates - to the phone number supplied which contains the location. The message will be opened every time when you want to update the person's location.\n\nIf you are involved in confidential matters, you may change your status in iMapp so that your mark is displayed only to your favorite friends; or you can make yourself invisible.\n\niMapp has the following subscriptions:\n\niMapp Premium - $4.99/mo, $39.99/yr\niMapp PRO - $9.99/mo, $59.99/yr\nWith Premium, you will be able to connect any number of devices to the iMapp service. This allows you to track connected devices via PC, locate persons using a cell phone and also access 24/7 support. With the PRO version, you get all the features of Premium as well as unlimited moving logs of all your friends and relatives. Premium and PRO yearly subscriptions come with a free 3 day trial. When the trial expires, the subscription will auto-renew on a monthly or yearly basis. You will receive your first charge 3 days after starting your trial. The subscription costs will be charged from your score, linked through an iTunes account.

      "label": "DriveMate KingKong is a simple speedometer app that uses the GPS function.\nThis retro style speedometer app has a warning alarm function for over speeding. It sounds an alarm sound* when the vehicle exceeds the set speed limit.\n\n*This app is named after the \"dingdong\" alarm sound (sounds like \"kin-kon\" or \"king-kong\" when expressed in Japanese).\n\n---- What is the speed warning alarm? ----\nIt was mandatory for all Japanese vehicles to be equipped with speed alarms between 1974 and 1986. Reminding you of the chime sounds of those days, this speed alarm is used to make you pay attention to the vehicle’s speed when you exceed a certain limit (ordinary passenger car: approx. 100 km/h, \"Kei\" car: approx. 80km/h).\n\n---- Target users ----\n■Persons who want to be aware of the moving speed and distance while driving/riding a car, bus, train, or bicycle and jogging or walking.\n■Persons who want to pay attention to the moving speed.\n■Persons who long for the nostalgic “dingdong” speed alarm sounds of the Japanese cars between 1974 to 1986.\n\n---- Features ----\n■Speedometer\nWhen the iPhone or iPad (Cellular devices only) receives Global Positioning System (GPS) satellite signals, the speedometer displays your current speed. The down arrow (▼) symbol will be displayed at the highest speed recorded since the app was started.\n\nYou can use the lower right switch to change the display unit between \"km/h\" and \"MPH.\"\n\nThe highest speed from five selections (60, 180, 240, 360 and 1500 km/h or MPH).\n\nThe left side indicator (satellite icon) among the indicators under the meter informs you of the receiving status of GPS satellite signals. The indicator lights red when you are in a place such as a building or tunnel that blocks reception of GPS satellite signals. It turns green when GPS satellite signals can be received properly.\n\n■Speed warning alarm\nWhen you exceed the set speed limit, the speed warning indicator under the screen lights red and the application sounds a “dingdong” speed warning alarm at the same time.\n\nYou can change the setting speed by tapping the Setting button and moving the red needle displayed on the screen with your finger.\n\nThe speed-warning alarm may sound slightly off-tempo sometimes because this speedometer attempts to reproduce the feel of the 70s and 80s alarm sound. This is not a bug.\n\nThis application software does not have a volume adjustment function. Use the volume control on the iPhone or iPad to adjust the sound.\n\n■Travelling distance\nThe meter displays the distance that has been traveled while this application software is turned on. The distance is measured in kilometers (or miles).\n\nThe upper display shows the odometer. You can change the value from settings to make it same as your car.\n\nThe lower display shows the trip meter. This value is reset when you tap the Reset button.\n\n■Warning lamp (rightmost lamp)\nWhen your smartphone is running out of battery, the rightmost indicator under the meter lights.\n\n【Warning and cautions】\n■Never operate this application software while you are driving a car.\n■If the speed alarm makes you drowsy, stop using the alarm immediately.\n■Be sure to use this application software when you are outside. Otherwise, it may not display the accurate speed and distance.\n■This application software uses the Location Service, therefore turn ON the Location Service when you use it.\n\n* Continued use of GPS running in the background would drain battery."

Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nHOW IT WORKS\nMost aircraft today are equipped with ADS-B transponders that transmit positional data. Flightradar24 has a rapidly growing network of 20,000 ground stations to receive this data that then shows up as aircraft moving on a map in the app. In an expanding number of regions, with the help of multilateration, we’re able to calculate the positions of aircraft that don’t have ADS-B transponders. Coverage is subject to change at any time.\n\nCONNECT WITH FLIGHTRADAR24\nWe love getting feedback on FR24. Since we’re unable to respond directly to reviews, contact us directly and we’ll be happy to assist if you’re having any issues.\n• email (support@fr24.com)\n• twitter (@flightradar24)\n• Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/Flightradar24)\n\nDISCLAIMER\nThe use of this app is strictly limited to entertainment purposes.

ArriveCAN no longer collects information on behalf of Public Health Agency of Canada. \n\nArriveCAN still contains Advance CBSA Declaration, which allows you to answer customs and immigration questions up to 72 hours in advance of flying into Canada. It is currently available to international air travellers who enter Canada at selected airports.\n\nBy submitting your customs and immigration information in advance, you will spend less time at a primary inspection kiosk (PIK) or eGate when you arrive at the airport. This contributes to shorter line-ups in arrivals halls.\n\nAt the border, you will be prompted to scan your travel document at a primary inspection device and confirm your identity. Once your identity has been confirmed, your Advance CBSA Declaration will be retrieved from ArriveCAN for you to review and certify. If changes are required, you can edit and update your declaration prior to certification.\n\nUse of the Advance CBSA Declaration feature of ArriveCAN is entirely optional. \n\nPlease refer to the accessibility notice for this app: https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/coronavirus-disease-covid-19/arrivecan.html#accessibility-notice\n\nThis app supports English, French and Spanish (displayed in the language of your device).\n\nFor more information: www.canada.ca/ArriveCAN"

      "label": "Professional GPS based TAXIMETER\n\nSince 2011, this GPS based Taximeter app has been continuously extended in close cooperation with regulators and taxi companies.\n\nOur app is used daily by thousands of professional drivers worldwide and has run millions of trips.\n\nThe app calculates with the highest precision, manages complex tariff structures and masters all conceivable driving situations.\n\n'LOCAL Mode'\n\nNo setup work is required to do a taxi trip: Click on 'FOR HIRE' and your trip starts.\n\nThe app will choose in our database the tariff that is geographically closest to you from the 230 preset tariffs in 60 countries.\n\nYOU DONT HAVE TO TELL THE APP WHICH TARIFF IT SHOULD USE!\n\nWhen your trip has completed, click on that same button in the lower right corner.\n\nIf our preset tariff is not the one you need, you can setup your own tariff in the app.\n\nUsing the app in 'LOCAL Mode' is free of charge.\n\n\n'LOGIN Mode'\n\nIf you are a Taxi Company, you will want to do more and have your Taxi Company's own tariff managed centrally.\n\nYou will want your driver to only do login / logout in the app and keep hands off the tariff or any settings.\n\nYou certainly will want to see all trips done by all drivers and trace their position in real-time.\n\nThe tariff configuration offers so many possibilities that it may seem overwhelming at first. That's why we assist you in this process. We can do the initial setup for you at no costs.\n\nWhen your tariff is setup, you will then create driver profiles with username and password.\n\n\nThe list of all app features is too long to be displayed here.\n\nHere are the most important ones:\n- Automatic tariff detection depending on location, day of the week and time.\n- Start (also delayed), stop and cancel of a trip\n- Cross-over speed\n- Waiting mode \n- Change applied tariff according to time or distance\n- Add extras to fare\n- Manage loss of the GPS signal (tunnel,...)\n- Global trip reference number \n- Add tip to fare\n- Passenger Receipt (QR-code, printing, airdrop,...)\n- Payment with Square\n- Fare calculation in advance\n- Company logo \n- Talking meter\n- .... and much more\n\nThe digital transformation has reached the taximeter. You no longer have to invest in an expensive and bulky built-in device. \nWe offer more functionality and security at a fraction of the cost.\nWe are happy to answer your questions!\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

      "label": "Silicon Valley’s new success story, inDrive is a free ride-hailing app available in more than 645 cities in 45 countries. We are growing fast by putting the power back in the hands of people.\n\ninDrive first emerged as a taxi alternative — a mobility app where affordable rides for passengers would still mean well-paid rides for drivers. \n \nBut now, there’s so much more to it. You can use inDrive to travel to other cities, send and receive packages, book a truck for your personal or business needs, and even hire a local pro to help you with whatever you need. You can also sign up as a driver, courier, or tasker.\n\nThe main idea is the same for all services: A fair price is the one you agree on — not hope for. inDrive exists to prove that people can always come to an agreement. \n\nWhat We Offer\nCITY RIDES\nAffordable everyday rides with no surge pricing. You get to set the fare and choose your ride based on the driver’s price offer, rating, number of completed rides, car model, and pickup time.\n\nINTERCITY RIDES\nA safe and convenient way to travel between cities. Specify your destination, pickup date, time and location, offer your fare and request a ride. \n\nCOURIER SERVICES\nThis door-to-door on-demand delivery service is a fast and safe way to send and receive packages of up to 20 kilos. Offer your fare ​​and track your delivery in real-time.\n\nFREIGHT SERVICES\nBook a truck for your delivery and moving needs. Set the time and the fare and specify any extra details in the comments. Wait for the offers to roll in and choose the one that works best for you.\n\nPROFESSIONAL SERVICES\nFrom home improvement to tutoring and beauty care services. Describe your task, name your price and get skilled help from local pros you can trust.\n\nWhy choose inDrive\nQUICK AND EASY\nIt's simple and fast to request an affordable ride — just enter points \"A\" and \"B\" in the app, name the fare you are willing to pay, and choose your driver.\n\nOFFER YOUR FARE\ninDrive provides you with a tailored, surge-free ride-hailing experience. Here you, and not the algorithm, decide on the fare and choose the driver. We do not set the pricing according to time and mileage like other services. You agree on a win-win price with the driver before the ride starts.\n\nCHOOSE YOUR DRIVER\ninDrive lets you choose your driver from a list of the drivers who accepted your ride request. Pick them based on the best deal, arrival time, driver's rating, number of completed trips, and even a car model.\n\nSTAY SAFE\nSee the driver's name, car model, license plate number, and the number of previously completed trips before accepting the ride. During your trip, you can share the driver's information and the real-time location of the car with your family or friends using the \"Share Your Ride\" button. Your real-time geolocation can be shared via messengers, social networks, e-mail, or SMS Text. All of that is there to make your experience safe & trusted. We're continuously adding new safety features to the app to make sure both riders and drivers can enjoy 100% safe rides.\n\nADD TRAVEL OPTIONS\nDo you have specific requirements? Specify travel add-ons — SUV, extra stops on the way, a child seat, or accommodating special needs. You can write your specific needs or any other details in the comments field like \"traveling with my pet,\" “I have luggage,\" etc.\n\nSIGN UP AS A DRIVER & MAKE EXTRA MONEY\nIf you have a car, inDrive provides an excellent opportunity to make extra money. Set your schedule and enjoy complete transparency with inDrive. See your passenger's drop-off location and fare before accepting the ride request. If the passenger’s price doesn’t seem enough, you can always offer your fare or skip the rides you don’t like with no penalties.\nBest of all, low-to-no service rates mean you make more money driving with inDrive!\n\nWe can't wait for you to experience it. Install the app and let’s ride!"

Pay the way you want, we accept cash and credit cards. \n \nWe have complemented our winning technology with an international standard training provided to our affiliated drivers and a thorough QC process that ensures the vehicles are in good condition. The star rating feature in the Smartzi App allows passengers to rate the driver and leave their feedback about the service at the end of each ride: This in turn helps us maintain endorsed standards by monitoring driver records and taking necessary action for or against drivers affiliated with the service.\n \nSmartzi riders enjoy the freedom to choose a ride by lowest price or closest proximity. The fare is fixed upfront directly from the drivers and there are no hidden costs. They can get their ride straightway or book in advance, and they can even choose a preferred driver.\n \nWe are available in UK and for additional details contact us via info@smartzi.com\n* Follow us on Twitter at https://twitter.com/SmartziApp\n* Like us on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/Smartzi-410432925963651/\n* Follow us on Instagram at https://www.instagram.com/smartziapp/\n* Follow us on YouTube at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQmcW-ZV4K9I9oztzZHNuPw\n\nNote: continued use of GPS running in the background can decrease battery life."

That you can turn your phone into a sonar?\n\nphyphox gives you access to the sensors of your phone either directly or through ready-to-play experiments which analyze your data and let you export raw data along with the results for further analysis. You can even define your own experiments on phyphox.org and share them with colleagues, students and friends.\n\nSelected Features:\n- A selection of pre-defined experiments. Just press play to start.\n- Export your data to a range of widely used formats\n- Remote-control your experiment through a web interface from any PC on the same network as your phone. No need to install anything on those PCs - all you need is a modern web browser.\n- Define your own experiments by selecting sensor inputs, defining analysis steps and creating views as an interface using our web-editor (http://phyphox.org/editor). The analysis can consists of just adding two values or using advanced methods like Fourier transforms and crosscorrelation. We offer a whole toolbox of analysis functions.\n\nSensors supported:\n- Accelerometer\n- Magnetometer\n- Gyroscope\n- Pressure\n- Microphone\n- Proximity\n- GPS\n*some sensors are not present on every phone.\n\nExport formats\n- CSV (Comma separated values)\n- TSV (Tab-separated values)\n- Excel\n(if you need other formats, please let us know)\n\n\nThis app has been developed at the 2nd Institute of Physics A at the RWTH Aachen University."

That's why we have developed a revolutionary method for children aged 3 to 12. Children have the brain plasticity to learn new languages far more easily than adults!\n\n====================\nWHY DO CHILDREN AND PARENTS LOVE THE HOLY OWLY METHOD?\nIt's not just an app: Holy Owly is the result of 3 years of research and development within a school, where teachers, linguist researchers and hundreds of children have participated in the development of the pedagogical method and unique content.\nOur commitment:\nOnly 5 minutes a day of learning: this format constitutes a daily ritual encouraging memory anchoring without over exposure to screens,\nChildren learn while having fun: thanks to our teaching method and the immersive adventure in which they participate, they learn 3 words or sentences 6 days a week on a theme from everyday life, \nChildren practice speaking: to learn a language you have to speak it! Our voice recognition system will allow children to practice on their own and improve their pronunciation. We make children proud to express themselves!\nOur content is curated for every age group during childhood, with a personalised course that adapts to each child's learning pace. Each year, children will be able to continue their adventure and continue to enrich their vocabulary and progress in oral expression.  \n\nThe Holy Owly method is organised in 7 stages: Discover, Repeat, Choose, Classify, Memorise, Play and Check. \n\n====================\nRECOMMENDED BY TEACHERS\nHoly Owly is the number one English application for children in France and is also recommended by teachers. Following numerous requests, we have adapted our methodology to schools in partnership with the publisher Bordas, and it is now used in several hundred classes in France! \n\n====================\nIn order to use all the functions of the application, you will have to choose a monthly or yearly subscription. You will have one week free before the first payment.\nTRY IT OUT WITH OUR FREE TRIAL WEEK\n\n====================\nThe content is 100% secure: without ads, children can learn safely.

      "label": "Thousands of users love Intelli Flashcards for its simplicity, effectiveness and elegance.\n\nBut first things first. This app is not free, as the value you get using it properly is enormous. I also don’t want you to do a blind bargain by making this app a paid one. So here is the deal: download it for free, try it with the only limitation of 50 flashcards, and if you love it, support the project by making an in-app purchase.\n\nYou add flashcards on your own, with vocabs or information you want to remember. Alternatively, you can import a 2-column CSV file with vocabs, if you have one.\n\nThe app is built around Spaced Repetition technique, which is not the best to learn new information (yes, I was wrong believing that initially), but the best to keep the information you’ve learnt. However, you can also learn with flashcards if you have a good visual memory. The best combination: learn new information by building up the associations and move that information to long-time memory by repeating it with flashcards.\n\nUnder the hood you will find Sebastian Leitner’s algorithm which basically has two simple rules: if you remember what’s on the back side of the card, the repeating interval is doubled (1-2-4-8-16 days and so on). If you forget the back side, start all over again with daily repeating. \n\nIntelli Flashcards was designed to be used every day by someone, who learns foreign language. I’m aware of the fact, that average user would add 1500+ flashcards on his learning path. He might be outdoors and in a rush, so the process of creating a new flashcard is 0 clicks away - it’s right on the main screen! The repeating session is just 1 click away.\n\nAfter a year of testing the spaced repetition algorithm, Derek Sivers (entrepreneur, programmer, founder of CD Baby and just a great person) stated that it was the most helpful learning technique he has tried for 14 years. To read more about Derek’s experiment, visit  www.sivers.org/srs \n\nFrom developer: after finishing working on Intelli, I started to use it to learn Spanish just to test the effectiveness of this algorithm. Intelli is not the only tool I’ve used, but it had the biggest impact on the learning speed and effectivity. I went from 0 to C1 level in Spanish in just 1 year, spending in average 15-20 minutes on learning every day. To read about other tools I’ve used to learn Spanish, go to www.boweidmann.com/language-learning\n\nBut then I’ve stumbled upon a great article about language learning, written by Tim Ferriss, the best-selling author and self-experimenter:\n\nhttp://fourhourworkweek.com/2014/07/16/how-to-learn-any-language-in-record-time-and-never-forget-it/\n\nInspired by that article, I’ve worked on the possibility of adding images directly to flashcards. Version 3.0 was born. Thank you, Tim! That function has enhanced the experience the users have got with the app. And it’s much more interesting to recall a vocab looking on image. That’s how Rosetta Stone works. That’s how we recall our native vocabs. Maybe I should start a new language just to test this technique with images. ;)\n\nUser experience is one of the keywords this app is built around. So your opinion on that is very important to me. You can contact me personally out of the app and receive my response as soon as possible. \n\nWhen I develop a new version of the app, I make sure new functionality does not affect the original user experience. However, it’s hard to predict the way you are going to make use of it. So if there is some unexpected behavior of the app, feel free to tell me about it.\n\nAnd when somewhere in the future you realize, Intelli has supported you a lot on your path of learning, I’d love your short review in AppStore."

      "label": "iNaturalist is a social network for sharing biodiversity information to help each other learn about nature. The primary goal is to connect people to nature, and the secondary goal is to generate scientifically valuable biodiversity data from these personal encounters. \n\niNaturalist helps you identify plants and animals with visually similar suggestions and verification by dedicated contributors. Get connected with a community of over a million scientists and naturalists who can help you learn more about nature! By recording and sharing your observations, you'll create research-quality data for scientists working to better understand and protect nature. \n\nKEY FEATURES\n• Identification suggestions: Take or import a photo and view the top 10 most visually similar species matches and tap through to get more information. You can view these suggestions even before creating an account.\n• Feedback from our community: Create an account to share your observations and start a conversation about what you saw. Can’t identify the organism? Start with a broad identification like “plants” or “fungi” so others with more expertise can find it and refine the identification. \n• Keep a record of all living things: Build your life list by posting to iNaturalist. Where, when, and what you saw is the basis of each observation you create.\n• Grounded in science: Every identification is connected to the tree of life, which means you can search for broad classifications like “Ferns” or “Fungi” as well as species-level identifications like “Humpback Whale” (and everything in between). \n• Advancing science & conservation: Millions of observations created and identified by the iNaturalist community are shared with the Global Biodiversity Information Facility where they are used to advance scientific understanding of biodiversity through open data and open science. \n• Enabling citizen science and community science: Join any of the tens of thousands of projects around the world on iNaturalist to draw attention to and collect data about particular species or places.\n• Not-for-profit: iNaturalist is a joint initiative of the California Academy of Sciences and the National Geographic Society, both 501(c)3 nonprofits in the United States. iNaturalist is free for anyone to use thanks to the generous support of many organizations and individuals. Thank you!\n• No hidden charges: This app is truly free because we believe nature is for everyone.\n• Best for wild plants and animals: The iNaturalist community is better at identifying wild plants and animals than those in gardens or horticulture. Get outside and find what’s wild!\n• Control how your location is shared: Set the privacy to obscured (only general location is shared) or private (no location is shared at all, but much harder for others to help identify). The locations of species at risk from disturbance are automatically obscured.\n• More than a mobile app: iNaturalist has even more extensive features and tools for learning and exploration. Get the full experience at inaturalist.org!\n• 35+ languages: iNaturalist has been translated into dozens of languages thanks to multilingual enthusiasts who want to see the community grow.\n• A global network: iNaturalist is used in every country on earth! In many countries, we have formal agreements with local organizations to promote iNaturalist. Use this app for contributing to all iNaturalist Network sites, including Naturalista (Mexico and Colombia), iNaturalist.NZ (New Zealand), iNaturalist.ca (Canada), Biodiversity4All (Portugal), iNaturalistAU (Australia), iNaturalistPa (Panama), iNaturalistEc (Ecuador), ArgentiNat (Argentina), iNaturalistil (Israel), and iNaturalistFi (Suomi/Finland)."

In just minutes you’ll start memorizing core Italian words, form sentences, learn to speak Italian phrases and take part in conversations. Fun Italian lessons improve your vocabulary, grammar and pronunciation like no other language learning method. Beginner or advanced learner, traveler or business professional with a tight schedule?

You started with hundreds of basic words and expressions, continued with tons of Italian grammar lessons and at the end of a full semester’s language course you could barely translate a sentence or say “Hello!” to a foreigner. That’s the traditional way to learn a language.\nMondly has a different approach, that’s opposite to the average language course.\n\nHere are the key features that make Mondly a great tutor for you:\n\n• Crystal-clear audio and professional voice actors. Learn the right Italian pronunciation from conversations between native speakers.\n\n• State-of-the-art Speech Recognition. Mondly knows exactly how to listen to your Italian words and phrases.

Memorizing hundreds of isolated words is not the way to go when it comes to learning Italian. Mondly teaches you Italian vocabulary by offering you core words and phrases. The app breaks the learning process down into short lessons and puts them into themed packs.\n\n• Verb conjugations. If you want to learn more during this course, just tap the Italian verbs and get the full conjugation on the screen, including the translation. It’s faster and better than a dictionary.\n\n• The Leaderboard. See how your friends are doing and compete with people from all over the world to become the best learner in the Mondly community family.

      "label": "The VokabelBox is a vocabulary trainer with which you can learn your vocabulary in a structured and lasting way. \n\nThe VokabelBox is limited to 50 words for testing. If you want to learn more vocabulary, you can remove the limit at any time by purchasing an in-app-purchase.\n\nLearn your vocabulary with three different exercises:\n\n- Exercise\n- Vocabulary test\n- Card box\n\nWith the exercises, you playfully add new words to your vocabulary. You either have to choose the correct translation from a series of suggestions, find the correct word pair, choose the initial letter or put the letters of the translation in the correct order. Your learning progress is shown in a diagram at any time.\n\nThe vocabulary test prepares you ideally for your next exam. If you have made mistakes, you can repeat the wrong answered vocabulary immediately, or you can start a test with new vocabulary. \n\nThe card box helps you to consolidate your vocabulary in your long-term memory. The card box has six compartments. The aim is to bring the vocabulary to the last compartment. If you make a mistake, the vocabulary goes back into the first compartment. The learning distance increases with each compartment. \n\nOverview of the learning gaps:\n\nBox 1: immediately\nTray 2: 4 days \nBox 3: 7 days \nBox 4: 14 days \nBox 5: 60 days\nBox 6: every 180 days\n(You can adjust the gaps to your needs)\n\nWith the folders you can structure your vocabulary and learn in a systematic way. For example, you can create a folder for a learning a book, then add a folder for each chapter and a box with the individual lessons for each chapter. So you can learn a single lesson, a whole chapter or even the whole book. \n\nBook (folder) -> Chapter (folder) -> Lessons (box with vocabulary).\n\nNot only can you create new vocabulary lists directly in the app, but you can also easily import them into the VokabelBox on your PC using your spreadsheet program. You can find instructions for this here: www.vokabelbox.com/xlsx-import\nThe app contains no vocabulary.\n\nWith the backup file you can save all your vocabulary along with your learning progress or transfer it to a second device.\n\nSupported languages:\n\n-Arabic\n-Bulgarian\n-Catalan\n-Chinese\n-Croatian\n-Czech\n-Danish\n-Dutch\n-English\n-Esperanto\n-Estonian\n-Finnish\n-French\n-Greek \n-Hebrew\n-Hindi\n-Hungarian\n-Indonesian\n-Icelandic\n-Italian\n-Japanese\n-Korean\n-Kurdish\n-Latin\n-Malagasy\n-Norwegian\n-Persian \n-Polish\n-Portuguese\n-Romanian\n-Russian\n-Serbian\n-Swedish\n-Spanish\n-Swahili\n-Thai\n-Turkish\n-Vietnamese\n\nIf you would like to have more languages, you have found errors, you have suggestions for improvement or you have questions about the VokabelBox, please send me an e-mail at:\n\nios-support@vokabelbox.com\n\nI wish you much fun learning!\n\nMarcel"

      "label": "Pro Metronome - The best metronome app. Period.\nFeatured in Apple's WWDC 2014 showcase \"Apps We Can't Live Without.\"\n------------\n\nPro Metronome is a powerful tool that helps you master both daily practice and stage performance. It has redefined how more than 4 million people sync to a beat. At the heart of the app lies our extremely precise, studio-quality metronome which we've refined even further with 3.13.\n\nThe free version is packed with features. We feature 13 different metronome tones including even a voice option. Running our newest RTP (Real-Time Playback) technology, our metronome clocks an accuracy of  ±20μs.\n\nPro Metronome is all about customization.  Change beat tones, accents, and even the dynamics of your rhythm (\"f\", \"mf\", \"p\" and \"mute\"). The Pro Version unlocks even more features including subdivisions and polyrhythm settings. Create complex patterns with triplets, dotted notes and non-standard time signatures.\n\nThe app supports several ways to experience beats. The free version of the app includes sound, but upgrading to Pro enables Visual, Flash, Vibrate and Airplay Modes. Visual and Vibrate Modes are great when you're playing loud instruments or when you need to FEEL the beat. Flash Mode uses the device's camera flash to sync up the entire band easily. You can even use Airplay Mode to beam the metronome to a projector or Apple TV!\n\nPro Metronome doesn't just help you keep time, it also helps you train. Pro Metronome built the Rhythm Trainer which mutes a selected bar in the beat, allowing your brain to fill in the gap and thus train your innate sense of timing. It's a simple, heavily requested idea not found in any other app to date.\n\nPro Metronome also supports a host of secondary features: background play mode, in-app volume adjust and even the ability to save song/tempo playlists to share with friends. It's a powerful, elegant and intuitive app - a must for the modern musician.\n\n----------------------\n\nPro Metronome Basic Features:\n\n* Intuitive, ad-free interface even in the free version\n* Dynamic time signature settings\n* 13 different time-keeping styles, including a counting voice\n* Dynamic accent settings, including  f, mf,  p, and mute indicators\n* Tap in your own BPM\n* Color Mode – see the beats graphically displayed on screen\n* Pendulum Mode, for visual feedback\n* Power-Saving/Background Modes – works in lock screen, home, or in another app\n* In-app volume adjustment\n* Extreme precision (±20μs) using RTP (Real Time Playback) technology\n* Timer to help you keep track of your session\n* Tone generators\n* Landscape Mode for increased resolution\n* Universal app – supported on iPhone, iPod and iPad\n* Audiobus support\n* Apple Watch support\n\n\nPro Features include:\n* Sensory aids: LED/Screen Flash Mode (iPhone 4 and above) and vibration (only available for iPhones)\n* Subdivisions including triplets, dotted notes, and many more\n* Polyrhythms – stack two rhythm tracks on top of each other\n* Programmable playlists – save and load your favorite settings\n* Dual Screen Mode using AirPlay (requires iPhone 4s/iPad2 and above)\n* Wirelessly playlists sharing\n* Rhythm Trainer – helps to develop your steady beats\n* Stage Mode – the indispensable companion for performing musicians.\n* Practice Mode – allows you to programme automatic tempo change to suit your practice regime.\n\n===About EUMLab=== \nEUMLab helps unleash your musical talent!

At least try it. Very professionally done app and helps tremendously with ear training.” \n\n “I used to get so frustrated when I'd try for hours on end to transcribe a piece or listen to a set of chords and not know why I couldn't tell the difference. Well this app has shown me why.” \n\n\nYou’ve always wanted to have a deeper understanding of music. You admire other musicians who can improvise and compose, or singers who can effortlessly find the harmony to a song. Interval training can help you achieve all of that – and let you get more out of the music you love. \n\nIf you’d like to learn interval training but you aren’t sure you’re ready to progress all the way through RelativePitch, try this Lite version for beginners. \n\nWith RelativePitchLite, you’ll get:\n\n• Training Mode – 5 lessons to gradually teach you intervals, step by step \n• Testing Mode – Check your progress and your ability to distinguish intervals  \n• Custom Mode – If you’re having trouble with one specific piece of training, set up a custom training and testing session to target your problem spots \n\nRelativePitchLite is fun and easy to use – in fact, many of our customers say it makes learning to distinguish intervals feel like a game. It’s also great for beginners; even if you don’t play an instrument or know music theory, you’ll be able to learn with this app easily. \n\nWhether you’re a musician yourself, or simply an admirer and lover of great music, RelativePitchLite changes the way you experience music. You’ll have that deeper understanding you always wanted of how it all comes together – and you’ll be amazed at how much more you get out of every piece you hear. \n\n_________\n\nRelativePitchLite is intended for beginners, and trains and tests ascending intervals starting from a C. More advanced students might enjoy RelativePitch, available on the App Store now!\n\nUsers say:\n “Nice app. Easy to use, does what it says. If you are a musician and want to sharpen your ear. Give this app a try!!” \n\n “The free version brought me exactly what I needed for my music course. I can test my ears on a custom test with the intervals I desire and it helped me improve my scores from 40% to 90%! happy!” \n\nIf you have any questions before buying, or any problems with the app, just email support@EasyEarTraining.com.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: The current version (1.16) has a bug which causes the app to crash for iOS7 users when visiting the \"Progress\" screen. We have submitted an update which should be released soon to resolve this for you as soon as possible! Our sincere apologies for any inconvenience or disruption to your training."

      "label": "Play By Ear is a call-and-response ear training application that helps you develop the ability to hear pitches and play them back on your instrument by ear. Unlike other applications which force you to press buttons to indicate the notes you've heard, Play By Ear uses pitch recognition so you can play the notes back on your instrument (piano, guitar, trumpet, etc).  Using your instrument to play the notes allows you to practice ear training in a method that most closely matches how you'll actually play music.\n\n----------------------\nAPPLICATION FEATURES:\n----------------------\n- Pitch recognition so you can use your instrument to interact with the ear trainer\n- Hands-free, continuous play\n- Interval exercises\n- Chord exercises\n- Random melody exercises\n- Scale pattern melody exercises\n- Jazz lick melody exercises\n- Melodic and harmonic note sequences\n- Ascending and descending note sequences\n- Microphone calibration\n- Customizable tempo\n- Ability to show or hide the first note\n- C, Bb, Eb, F, G, and D key centers to match your instrument\n\n----------------------\nNote: Your device needs a microphone to fully enjoy Play By Ear's pitch recognition features.  iPads, iPhones, and the latest iTouch all have microphones built-in, however older iTouch devices will need a headset or similar external microphone."

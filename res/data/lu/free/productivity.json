      "label": "Use Microsoft Authenticator for easy, secure sign-ins for all your online accounts using multi-factor authentication, passwordless, or password autofill. You also have additional account management options for your Microsoft personal, work or school accounts.\n \nGetting started with multi-factor authentication\nMulti factor authentication (MFA) or two factor authentication (2FA) provides a second layer of security. When logging in with multi-factor authentication, you’ll enter your password, and then you’ll be asked for an additional way to prove it’s really you. Either approve the notification sent to the Microsoft Authenticator, or enter the one-time password (OTP) generated by the app. The one-time passwords (OTP codes) have a 30 second timer counting down. This timer is so you never have to use the same time-based one-time password (TOTP) twice and you don’t have to remember the number. The one-time password (OTP) doesn’t require you to be connected to a network, and it won’t drain your battery. You can add multiple accounts to your app, including non-Microsoft accounts like Facebook, Amazon, Dropbox, Google, LinkedIn, GitHub, and more.\n \nGetting started with passwordless\nUse your phone, not your password, to log into your Microsoft account. Just enter your username, then approve the notification sent to your phone. Your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN will provide a second layer of security in this two-step verification process. After you’ve signed in with two factor authentication (2FA), you’ll have access to all your Microsoft products and services, such as Outlook, OneDrive, Office, and more.\n \nGetting started with autofill\nMicrosoft Authenticator app can also autofill passwords for you. Sign-in on the Passwords tab inside the Authenticator app with your personal Microsoft account to start syncing passwords, including the passwords saved in Microsoft Edge. Make Microsoft Authenticator the default autofill provider and start autofilling passwords on apps and sites you visit on your mobile. Your passwords are protected with multi-factor authentication in the app. You will need to prove yourself with your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN to access and autofill passwords on your mobile. You can also import passwords from Google Chrome and other password managers.\n \nMicrosoft personal, work or school accounts\nSometimes your work or school might ask you to install the Microsoft Authenticator when accessing certain files, emails, or apps. You will need to register your device to your organization through the app and add your work or school account. Microsoft Authenticator also supports cert-based authentication by issuing a certificate on your device. This will let your organization know that the sign-in request is coming from a trusted device and help you seamlessly and securely access additional Microsoft apps and services without needing to log into each. Because Microsoft Authenticator supports single sign-on, once you have proven your identity once, you will not need to log in again to other Microsoft apps on your device.\n \nOptional Access permissions:\nMicrosoft Authenticator includes the following optional access permissions. All these require user consent. If you choose to not grant these optional access permissions, you can still use Microsoft Authenticator for other services that do not require such permission. For more information see https://aka.ms/authappfaq\nAccessibility Service:  Used to optionally support Autofill on more apps and sites.\nLocation: Sometimes your organization wants to know your location before allowing you to access certain resources. The app will request this permission only if your organization has a policy requiring location.\nCamera: Used to scan QR codes when you add a work, school, or non-Microsoft account.\nRead the contents of your storage: This permission is only used when you report a technical problem through the app settings.Some information from your storage is collected to diagnose the issue."

      "label": "*** Free App for MIXvoip users! ***\r\n\r\nPindo by MIXvoip provides:\r\n\n- privacy\n\n- productivity \r\n- cheaper international calls  \r\n\r- control of your mobile identity\r\n\nPindo is created for professionals, small business owners and practically anyone  involved in dealing with other people. It is made to separate the business and personal conversations. \r\n\r\nYou don't need to have two mobile devices – one for business and another for personal conversations. In Pindo you can add and proactively use your existing business phone number, instead of your personal one. This can really help you draw the line between business and personal life and create that balance you’ve always wanted. \r\n\r\nHalf of all marriages end in divorce for various reasons. One of the main ones is the inability to separate business from personal life. Pindo can really help, because you’ll no longer have to answer business conversations on your personal mobile phone. Even if you use only one mobile device. When you organize your life like this can create a lot of leverage in business, productivity, and more nurturing personal relationships.  \r\n\r\nNo need to carry two mobile devices anymore!\r\n\r\nSTAY PRIVATE\r\nYou can manage easily who can reach you without compromising your personal information. When you call someone, you can choose to display from what number you are calling (business or personal). This gives your more privacy and security. \r\n\r\nUnlike most mobile apps out there, this is not a VoIP service. Pindo does not use your Wi-Fi, 3G/4G connection to make phone calls. It uses your cellular network and your current mobile plan at no extra cost. \r\n\r\nRECORDING CONVERSATIONS\r\nYou can record the phone conversation with Pindo by pressing 99 during a phone call at any time. So if you want to record important conversations to replay for later, you can do that too. You’ll simply get a text message after the phone call with the link to the recorded audio file. This opens up a lot of possibilities, because you can now create an archive of important conversations, especially if they include a professional advice, mentoring, or something else related to your business. \r\n\r\nSETUP PINDO IN 3 LITTLE STEPS\r\n1. Download the app (it’s FREE)\r\n2. Enter your mobile phone number\r\n3. Scan your profile's QR Code or choose server and enter your credentials. \r\nYou are done! \r\n\r\nSUPPORTED COUNTRIES\r\nIf you want to use Pindo, it’s important to know what countries we currently support. Here’s the list below: \r\n\r\n- United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Netherlands, Finland, Bulgaria, Greece, Turkey, Ukraine, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Italy, Luxembourg, Belgium, Slovenia, Switzerland, Portugal, Germany, France, Israel, Czech Republic, Dominican Republic, Croatia, Poland, Norway and Denmark. \r\n\r\nIf your country is missing, do not worry. We’ll be adding more soon, just contact us!\r\n\r\nCHEAP LONG-DISTANCE CALLS\r\nIf you have relatives or friends abroad, Pindo can be handy, especially when it comes to savings. Europe Union (EU) has plenty of flat rates, but there are still scenarios where you SAVE A LOT MORE when using Pindo."

The app notifies you within seconds about calls, voice messages, and other events. Enjoy mobile access to the photos, music and other data stored on your FRITZ!Box from anywhere. Use the app to conveniently control your call diversions, smart home plugs and thermostats, answering machines, and other home network devices connected with your FRITZ!Box. If you want to change any settings, simply use the app to open the user interface - from wherever you are.\n\nPrerequisite for using the MyFRITZ!App: FRITZ!Box with FRITZ!OS version 6.50 or higher.\nPrerequisite for full scope of functions of the MyFRITZ!App: FRITZ!Box with FRITZ!OS version 7.29 or higher.\n\nIf you also want to use all of the functions when you are on the go, the FRITZ!Box must be connected to the internet and have a public IPv4 address.\n\n \nFrequently Asked Questions:\n\nQuestion: How can I log into a different FRITZ!Box?\n\nMyFRITZ!App can be used with several FRITZ!Box products. If you want to switch to a different FRITZ!Box, select the desired FRITZ!Box in the app settings (gear) or tap \"Add another FRITZ!Box\" to register the new FRITZ!Box. To register a new FRITZ!Box, you must be connected to that FRITZ!Box's wireless network.\n\nQuestion: Why can I no longer switch my wireless network and my guest network using the app?\n\nSeveral FRITZ!Boxes (for instance, the FRITZ!Box 7490) require FRITZ!OS 7.10, which is currently not available for all FRITZ!Boxes.\n\nQuestion: Why can't I access my FRITZ!Box when I am away from home?\n\nIf you want to change the settings, you must be connected to your FRITZ!Box's wireless network. Make sure that you enabled \"Enable use from on the go\" in the app's settings.\nIf you also want to access the FRITZ!Box user interface from on the go, a FRITZ!Box user who has been granted the right \"Access from the Internet allowed\" must be configured.\n\nSome internet service providers (including many cable providers) provide connections that do not allow you to access the home connection from the internet or certain restrictions apply because no public IPv4 address is provided. MyFRITZ!App normally recognizes that type of connection automatically and displays a corresponding message. These types of connections are called \"DS-Lite\", \"Dual-Stack-Lite\" or \"Carrier Grade NAT\" (CGN). You can ask your provider whether it would be possible to receive a public IPv4 address.\n\nQuestion: What can I do if there is no update to FRITZ!OS 6.50 or later for my FRITZ!Box?\n\nUnfortunately, in this case you cannot use the MyFRITZ!App.\n\nQuestion: If I have suggestions for improving the app or discover an error, how can I tell AVM?\n\nWe always welcome feedback! Open the app settings (gear) and tap \"Give Feedback\" to send us a brief message. A log is automatically attached to your message; this also helps us to analyze errors."

      "label": "FRITZ!App Smart Home: Clear, convenient, practical\n\nThe new FRITZ!App Smart Home is the convenient remote control for your FRITZ! Smart Home devices, at home or from on the go. All you need is a FRITZ!Box with FRITZOS 7.10 or higher.\n\nThe FRITZ!App Smart Home is your practical helper, with which you can control many Smart Home functions. You can, for instance:\n\n- use the FRITZ!DECT 200 smart plug to switch on the aquarium, heat up the coffee machine, or disconnect media players and TVs from power overnight.\n- use the outdoor FRITZ!DECT 210 smart plug to monitor the cost of charging the e-bike, or to switch on the atmospheric garden lighting.\n- use the FRITZ!DECT 301 radiator control to heat the living room to the temperature you like, and save money with automatic heating plans.\n- use the FRITZ!DECT 500 LED light to provide for a feel-good atmosphere in the evening, and stimulating lighting in the morning.\n\nIn the FRITZ!App Smart Home, the arrangement of the Smart Home devices can be tailored to your own personal wishes – simply place a finger on a tile until it is released, and then move it to the desired position.\n\nYour FRITZ! Smart Home can do even more. You can register new Smart Home devices with your FRITZ!Box by a simple press of the button. It is easy to configure heating plans, automatic switching, templates and groups in the user interface of your FRITZ!Box. The FRITZ!DECT 400 switches your floor lamp in the living room or your outside lighting via FRITZ!DECT 200 and 210. Our latest product is the FRITZ!DECT 440 switch with four buttons and a display. FRITZ!DECT 440 can dim your FRITZ!DECT 500 LED light, for instance, and measure the temperature for FRITZ!DECT 301.\n\nTip: Expand the possibilities in your FRITZ! Smart Home today with the upcoming FRITZ!OS for the FRITZ!Box. The software includes completely redesigned operation of the Smart Home in the FRITZ!Box user interface, new functions for the upcoming 4-button FRITZ!DECT 440 switch, and presents a whole range of colors in its support for the new FRITZ!DECT 500 LED light. The new FRITZ!OS is available for you to test in the FRITZ! Lab at en.avm.de/fritz-lab.\n\nPrerequisite\nFRITZ!Box with FRITZ!OS version 7.10 or higher\nIf the internet connection of your FRITZ!Box does not have a public IPv4 address, there may be some restrictions to use on the go in some mobile or Wi-Fi networks.\n\n\nFrequently asked questions:\n\nQuestion: How can I register with another FRITZ!Box?\n\nThe FRITZ!App Smart Home supports the operation on exactly one FRITZ!Box. If you want to change the FRITZ!Box, select \"New Login\" in the settings. To log on to the FRITZ!Box, you must be connected to the Wi-Fi of your FRITZ!Box.\n\nQuestion: Why can't I access my FRITZ!Box when I'm on the move?\n\nMake sure that you have activated \"Use on the move\" in the settings. To change the settings, you must be connected to the WLAN of your FRITZ! Box.\n\nSome Internet service providers (increasingly cable providers) provide connections where remote access from the Internet to the connection at home is not possible or only possible with restrictions because no public IPv4 address is provided. The FRITZ!App Smart Home usually detects such connections automatically and displays a corresponding message. Such connection types are called \"DS-Lite\", \"Dual-Stack-Lite\" or \"Carrier Grade NAT\" (CGN). If necessary, you can ask your provider whether there is an option to obtain a public IPv4 address."

Used by millions worldwide, our all-new email app protects your communications and has everything you need to easily manage your inbox.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal says:\n“Proton Mail offers encrypted email, which makes it virtually impossible for anyone to read it except the sender and the recipient.”\n\nWith the all-new Proton Mail app, you can:\n• Create a @proton.me or @protonmail.com email address \n• Send and receive encrypted emails and attachments with ease\n• Switch between multiple Proton Mail accounts\n• Easily manage your email with conversations\n• Keep your inbox tidy and clean with folders, labels and simple swipe-gestures\n• Receive new email notifications\n• Send Password-protected Emails to anyone\n• Enjoy your inbox in dark mode\n\nWhy use Proton Mail?\n• Proton Mail is free — We believe everyone deserves privacy. Upgrade to a paid plan to get more done and support our mission. \n• Easy to use — Our all-new app has been redesigned to make it easier to read, organize, and write your emails.\n• Your inbox is yours — We don’t spy on your communications to show you targeted ads. Your inbox, your rules.\n• Rigorous encryption — Your entire inbox is secured, on all your devices. No one can read your emails but you. Proton is privacy, guaranteed by end-to-end and zero-access encryption.\n• Unmatched protection — We offer strong phishing, spam, and spying/tracking protection for all your communications.\n\nIndustry Leading Security Features\nMessages are stored on Proton Mail servers using end-to-end encryption at all times and are transmitted securely between Proton servers and user devices. This largely eliminates the risk of message interception.\n\nZero Access to Your Email Content\nProton Mail's zero access architecture means that your data is encrypted in a way that makes it inaccessible to us. Data is encrypted on the client side using an encryption key that Proton does not have access to. This means we don't have the technical ability to decrypt your messages.\n\nOpen-Source Cryptography\nProton Mail's open-source software has been thoroughly vetted by security experts from around the world to ensure the highest levels of protection. Proton Mail only uses secure implementations of AES, RSA, along with OpenPGP, while all of the cryptographic libraries used are open source. By using open-source libraries, Proton Mail can guarantee that the encryption algorithms used do not have clandestinely built-in back doors.\n\nProton Mail in the press:\n“Proton Mail is a Gmail-like email system which uses end-to-end encryption, making it impossible for outside parties to monitor.” Forbes\n\n“A new email service being developed by a group who met at MIT and CERN promises to bring secure, encrypted email to the masses and keep sensitive information away from prying eyes.” Huffington Post\n\nFollow Proton on social media for all the latest news and offers:\nFacebook: /proton\nTwitter: @protonprivacy\nReddit: /protonmail\nInstagram: /protonprivacy\n\nFor more information, visit: https://proton.me/mail\nOur open-source code base: https://github.com/ProtonMail"

      "label": "The most simple and useful Calendar app ever! When it comes to calendar apps, simple calendar is the best choice! We pursued a simple and easy design throughout the app.\n\nWith an emphasis on simplicity, Simple Calendar is super easy to navigate, and with various customizing features including font size, you can use it in the style that suits you best.\n\nIt's perfect for those looking for a minimalist calendar app focused on functionality instead of extra (and sometimes unnecessary) features. Simple calendar has been receiving the highest ratings among users, plus it's FREE! Give it a try right now.\n\n[List of functions]\n· 6 Widgets\n· Font size adjustment (10 sizes)\n· Weekly calendar (7 days · 5 days · 3 days) Display\n· Supports daily calendar\n· Color coding for different calendars\n· Enter notes, URLs and maps\n· Link with other scheduling apps\n· Headlines last for days for easy viewing\n· Set your favorite day of the week as a holiday\n· Change the start day of the week\n· Lock with passcode\n\n\n[Function Details]\n\n■ iOS calendar\nThis app uses the iOS calendar app. Schedules made with this app will be synchronized with other scheduling apps and the iOS standard calendar.\n\n■ Adjust font size\nYou can choose from five font sizes of extra-small, small, medium, large, and extra-large.\nYou can also pick between light and bold font, to make prioritized events pop up better.\n\n■ Monthly, weekly, and daily calendar\nWith one tap at the bottom of the screen, you can switch between monthly, weekly, and daily display.\nSwitching the weekly calendar between 7, 5  or 3 day display allows you to find the display that is right for you.\nBecause the app memorizes the calendar style used the last time you opened it, it's super convenient for people who only want to use the weekly display.\n\n■ Color coding\nYou can create separate calendars according to different schedules such as work and home. And then, manage them clearly by color coding them. You can switch the background color between white and black as well.\n\n■ Secure passcode lock\nYou can lock the app with a password securely, if you don't want people to see your calendars. Of course, it corresponds to Face ID, Touch ID as well.\n\n■ Notification settings\nYou can set up notifications for scheduled events, at the event time and also 5 min, 15min, or more prior to the event so you don't miss important plans!\n\n\n[Note to users]\nSince this calendar app uses the standard function of the iOS calendar, all schedules older than one month may disappear with the default setting. This also applies to other apps. If you want to keep past events, please follow the procedures below after installing the app.\n\n1. Open the iOS Settings app.\n2. Tap \"Calendar\".\n3. Tap \"Sync\".\n4. Select \"All Events\".\n\nThis should solve the problem.\nIf you still have questions, visit the \"Help · FAQ\" page from the app for further details.\n\n\n【Help/Inquiries】\nPlease visit \"Help · FAQ\" from the setting screen of the app. If this doesn't help, please contact us through \"Inquiry / feedback\" from the setting screen. We can respond to you much quicker this way, so please do so instead of asking us questions in the app review, since it takes a while for those to be reflected onto the page."

Each of them knows: Good rehearsals are the basis for every successful performance.\n\nAn area with room for improvement is well structured and understandable scheduling for rehearsals and performances.\nThe App Konzertmeister supports orchestras and choirs precisely in this challenge.\n\nIn many associations it is common for appointments to be communicated via various channels: SMS, e-mail, WhatsApp or Facebook are often to be found here. This variety of communication paths often makes it difficult for everyone involved to maintain an overview.\n\nKonzertmeister aims to provide a simple and direct way to remedy this - it offers its members a clearly structured schedule with a direct opportunity to RSVP with just one click.\n\nThis attendance information is immediately visible to the musical director, who is always able to observe the expected attendance status on their created appointments.\nThus, the leader knows at any time which rehearsal or performance will be well attended and can adjust their planning accordingly.\n\nFor more detailed structuring, members can be divided into sections and so also part or section rehearsals are easily defined.\nFurthermore, there is also the possibility to import Konzertmeister appointments in a personal calendar and therefore also available outside the app at any time."

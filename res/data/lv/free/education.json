      "label": "Math can be fun. For everyone. From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

      "label": "Pl@ntNet is an application that allows you to identify plants simply by photographing them with your smartphone. Very useful when you don't have a botanist on hand!\n\nPl@ntNet is also a great citizen science project: all the plants you photograph are collected and analysed by scientists around the world to better understand the evolution of plant biodiversity and to better preserve it.\n\nPl@ntNet allows you to identify and better understand all kinds of plants living in nature: flowering plants, trees, grasses, conifers, ferns, vines, wild salads, cacti (and many more). \n\nPl@ntNet can also identify a large number of cultivated plants (in parks and gardens) but this is not its primary purpose. We especially need Pl@ntNet’s users to inventory the wild plants, those that you can observe in nature, but also those that grow on the sidewalks of cities or in the middle of your vegetable garden!\n\nThe more visual information you give to Pl@ntNet about the plant you are observing, the more accurate the identification will be. There are indeed many plants that look alike from afar and it is sometimes small details that distinguish two species of the same genus. \n\nFlowers, fruits and leaves are the most characteristic organs of a species and it is them that should be photographed first. But any other detail can be useful, such as thorns, buds or hair on the stem. A photograph of the whole plant is also very useful information, but it is often not sufficient to allow a reliable identification.\n\nAt present, Pl@ntNet makes it possible to recognize about 20,000 species. We are still a long way from the 360,000 species living on earth, but Pl@ntNet is getting richer every day thanks to the contributions of the most experienced users among you. \n\nDon't be afraid to contribute yourself! Your observation will be reviewed by the community and may one day join the photo gallery illustrating the species in the application.\n\nThe new version of Pl@ntNet released in January 2019 includes many improvements and new features:\n-The ability to filter recognized species by genus or family.\n-The differentiated data revision that gives more weight to users who have demonstrated the most skills (in particular the number of species observed, validated by the community).\n-The re-identification of shared observations, whether yours or those of other users of the application.\n-The multi-flora identification that allows you to search for the photographed plant in all the flora of the application and not only in the one you have selected. Very useful when you are not sure what flora to look for.\n-The selection of your favorite floras to access them more quickly.\n-The navigation at different taxonomic levels in image galleries.\n-The mapping of your observations.\n-Links to many factsheets.\n\nThe web version of the application is also available at the following address: https://identify.plantnet.org/"

APRENDIZAJE DE LA GRAMÁTICA con reglas bien ilustrativas\n2. ENTRENADOR para reforzar el vocabulario y las reglas\n3. MEMORIZACIÓN DEL VOCABULARIO con ayuda de asociaciones\n4. COMPRENSIÓN AUDITIVA para aprender a entender el lenguaje oral\n5. CHECKPONTS para controlar lo aprendido y subsanar lagunas\n6. ¡PRÁCTICAS INUSUALES! Historias policíacas en inglés adaptado para consolidar los conocimientos\n\nSimpler es ideal para principiantes. Con su ayuda puede aprender inglés desde cero. Asimismo puede hacer una prueba de nivel y empezar a estudiar a partir de cualquier nivel\n\n=====================\n\n¿POR QUÉ SIMPLER ES EL MÉTODO MÁS RÁPIDO Y EFICAZ DE APRENDER INGLÉS?\n\n1. Hemos creado el SISTEMA DE ENSEÑANZA DE LA GRAMÁTICA más claro y sencillo, conveniente a los principiantes. No le hace falta adentrarse en los mínimos detalles de la gramática inglesa, ni leer libros de texto. Descompusimos el inglés en átomos, seleccionamos solo la info más relevante, la reconstituimos y convertimos en estructuras fáciles e inteligibles. Cada regla gramatical del curso autodidacta Simpler es una instrucción corta que enseguida se refuerza con preguntas y prácticas.\n\n2. Hemos creado un SISTEMA sencillo y claro de MEMORIZACIÓN DEL VOCABULARIO INGLÉS. Aparte de la traducción, se visualiza una imagen especial que ilustra el significado de la palabra desconocida. Además, se le muestra un texto asociativo que acompaña la imagen y le permite idear sus propias asociaciones mnemónicas. El curso autodidacta Simpler organiza el repaso del vocabulario en intervalos que fueron calculados con la curva del olvido de Ebbinghaus. ¡Con Simpler su vocabulario de inglés se ampliará notablemente!\n\n3. Es imprescindible poder entender el lenguaje oral en inglés. Para ello, los audios de las frases fueron grabados por hablantes nativos, lo que es especialmente importante para aquellos que empiezan a estudiar inglés desde cero. Asimismo, creamos un apartado especial de audiciones que llamamos PRÁCTICAS. Después de estudiar las reglas gramaticales, se le ofrece una tarea auditiva con el fin de entender frases en inglés.\n\n4. Creamos un sistema de tareas de toda clase que llamamos ENTRENADOR. Incluye una gama de actividades variadas que suponen un entrenamiento de traducción de frases del español al inglés y viceversa. Además, las reglas están pensadas de tal manera que el estudiante pueda aprender a aplicarlas con facilidad. Las lecciones del Simpler no se pasan al olvido, gracias a que el ENTRENADOR incluya también actividades de lecciones anteriores.\n\n5. ¡EXCLUSIVIDAD! Historias policíacas en inglés adaptado.

Чтобы набрать 4.5 балла, надо ответить правильно на 90 вопросов из 100.\n\nАлгоритм расчета баллов позволяет быстро перейти к следующему уроку, если вы знаете тему хорошо, и не позволит этого сделать, если ваших знаний недостаточно.\n\nДля тех, кто хорошо знает язык, в программе реализован режим повышенной сложности (включается в настройках). В сложном режиме ответ требуется ввести с клавиатуры по буквам, а не выбрать из представленных на экране вариантов. То есть надо знать как пишутся английские слова.\n\nПодробнее об этой и других программах для изучения иностранных языков читайте на нашем сайте:\n* http://polyglotmobile.ru/\n\nПрисоединяйтесь к нам ВКонтакте.\n* http://vk.com/polyglotmobile\n\nПолиглотом может стать каждый!"

      "label": "«Барбоскины на даче учат таблицу умножения» – это веселая и полезная игра – математика для детей. Проверенный метод обучения поможет запомнить таблицу умножения легко, быстро и навсегда.\r\n\r\nВ детском приложении – тренажере таблицы умножения – обучение идёт в удобной для запоминания форме от простого к сложному, от сложения к умножению. Осваивая навык умножения, дети получают игровые призы. Игра с любимыми героями Барбоскиными отлично мотивирует ребенка, и он движется от одного успешно выполненного блока к другому.\r\nЗадания нацелены на лёгкое запоминание результатов умножения чисел от 1 до 10. Этот метод обучения математике рекомендован учителями начальных классов и опробован в десятках московских школ.\r\nСюжет игры основан на мультике «Барбоскины на даче». Барбоскины – весёлое семейство собак – отправляются на летние каникулы на дачу. Малыш находит себе новых друзей – Котов и охотно включается с ними в игру, не зная, что они скрывают свои истинные намерения! Артистичная Лиза и красотка Роза легко обведут Котов вокруг пальца. Вместе с любимыми персонажами дети получают новые знания и закрепляют их в увлекательных мини-играх:\r\n- «Лучник». Помоги Малышу выбрать правильную мишень, играя в индейцев.\r\n- «Рыбалка». Вместе с Дружком поймай самую крупную рыбу. \r\n- «Шарики». Налови Розе для праздника много воздушных шаров.\r\n- «Лайки». Проверь, чьи фотокарточки собрали больше лайков. \r\n- «Химик». Помоги Гене в его научных экспериментах. \r\nПроходи мини-игры и тренажеры и помогай Гене собрать его научный проект! Прокачивай знания и навыки, и кто знает, может, ему удастся получить Нобелевскую премию?\r\nОсобенности игры «Барбоскины на даче. Таблица умножения»:\r\n- Игра для детей одобрена для обучения ребенка математике учителями начальной школы.\r\n- В игре реализовано пошаговое освоение таблицы умножения, с постепенным нарастанием сложности и разнообразия задач. Если ты – в самом начале обучения таблице умножения, выбирай одно-два числа.\r\n\r\n- Игра-тренажер – это идеальное сочетание математики и развлекательных игр для девочек и мальчиков.\r\n- Тренируйся в умножении ежедневно, получай достижения и собирай награды.\r\n- Выдержи «Контрольную работу» с отличницей Лизой Барбоскиной – и «пятёрка» на контрольной в школе гарантирована! \r\nВыучить таблицу умножения детям к школе бывает непросто, особенно трудно приходится их родителям.\r\n2 х 2 = 5 или 3?\r\nУстановите приложение и помогите ребенку выучить таблицу умножения!"

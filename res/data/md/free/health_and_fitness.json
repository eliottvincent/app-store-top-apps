      "label": "- WHAT IS LOÓNA?\nloóna is the first app that lets you quickly disconnect from a long stressful day and get in the right mood for sleep.\n\n- SO, IT'S ANOTHER SLEEP APP, RIGHT?\n Not exactly. loóna isn’t a list of direct go-to-sleep techniques, but rather a mood-altering app that helps you to stay calm during the day and prepares you emotionally for going to sleep in the evening.\n\n- WHY IS BEDTIME MOOD IMPORTANT?\nNegative emotions we accumulate during the day are processed and consolidated by our brain during sleep making them more difficult to disassociate from when faced again in the future. Moreover, feeling angry, anxious, down, or, the opposite, excited, and elated, is likely to affect latencies to sleep onset and REM-sleep. People mistake it for the symptoms of a sleep disorder, but in reality, they just may be in the wrong mood for sleep.\n\n- HOW DOES LOÓNA WORK?\nFrom the wake up and during the busy day Loóna will support your emotional states with playlists and immersive stories. Each night you’ll have a recommended sleepscape. A sleepscape is a guided session that combines activity-based relaxation, storytelling, and sounds in a unique way. Complete it to shut the frantic world out, reset your mind, and create the perfect mood for sleep.\n\nLoóna saves your sleepscape sessions to your Apple Health app.\n\nThe upgrade to loóna PLUS provides access to the entire collection of sleepscapes. Our subscription options are: 1-month subscription for $12.99, 1-year subscription with a 7 day trial for $39.99 (price may vary by location).\n\nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal. Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nTerms of service: http://loona.app/terms\nPrivacy policy: http://loona.app/privacy"

      "label": "Despite simplicity, I’ve managed to produce a fully functional Fitness Journal for workout logging and planning: with calendar and statistics. Gym Record works completely offline and has no excess functions at all. I’ve honestly tried my best to make it nice & simple. My biggest pride is intuitive & clean interface.\n\nThe app is great both for home & gym training because the list of exercises is determined by the user. Instead of hundreds of pre-installed workout programs (easy to get lost in), you design a database yourself — save just what you need, nothing extra.\n\n‣ Create and customise exercises: from yoga to strength training.\n‣ Group them in supersets.\n‣ Log your workouts in a few taps.\n‣ Watch your progress: gain mass, lose weight or just be toned. \n\nIn order to achieve minimalism, I’ve excluded as many elements and functions as possible. However, if you are missing something be sure to contact me via www.gymrecord.app, so that we can improve the app and make it better together. At the moment I am working on the following features:\n\n‣ iCloud backup\n‣ More statistics\n\nThe only limitation of the free version is the maximum amount of 8 workouts. You can ignore this limit, simply delete some old workouts from calendar to free up the space. Or you can go for a premium subscription, the price of which is comparable to the cost of a cup of coffee. This support, as well as an honest review, helps me to develop my project. I promise not to embed any in-app ads or extra purchases, I use Gym Record myself and want it to be perfectly nice, clean and useful.\n\nPrivacy: https://www.gymrecord.app/privacy-policy\nTerms: https://www.gymrecord.app/terms-of-use"

      "label": "Мы разработали приложение специально для тех, кто хочет привести свое тело в отличную форму, занимаясь прямо у себя дома. Упражнения доступны для людей с любой физической подготовкой, и для их выполнения вам не понадобится дополнительное фитнес-оборудование. Программа составлена профессиональными тренерами по фитнесу на основе научных исследований и рекомендаций. Ежедневные занятия помогут вам значительно улучшить свою физическую форму и состояние здоровья в целом.\n\nПочему это приложение подойдет для каждого?\n\n • Программа тренировок позволяет включить их даже в самый загруженный график – перед началом занятия вы сможете увидеть количество упражнений и их продолжительность\n\n • Все упражнения рассчитаны на работу с собственным весом – вам не придется тратиться на покупку дорогостоящего оборудования или абонемент в тренажерный зал\n\n • Видеоролики и подробное описание упражнений гарантируют правильное выполнение упражнений\n\n • Советы от фитнес-тренеров помогут вам быстрее добиться желаемого результата\n\nКак только вы установите приложение, вам будет доступна первая тренировка. План упражнений составлен таким образом, что на каждый день у вас будет появляться новая программа. После того, как вы выполните все задания из первого дня, на следующий день вам будет открыт доступ к новым заданиям.\n \nУчитывая особенности человеческого организма, каждая последующая тренировка будет более интенсивной, чем предыдущая – ведь тело быстро адаптируется к одинаковой нагрузке, а значит, для достижения результата с каждым днем сложность занятий должна будет возрастать. Всего несколько минут ежедневных занятий – и ваше тело станет сильным, а мышцы всегда будут в тонусе.\n\nПрограмма одной тренировки включает в себя упражнения на разные группы мышц. Также есть возможность включить в свои занятия разминку и растяжку. Придерживаясь поставленного плана, вы сможете уже за месяц значительно улучшить свое тело и убрать лишний вес.\nДля того, чтобы ваши тренировки проходили без ошибок, для каждого упражнения мы загрузили видеоролик с подробным описанием правильной техники.\n\nСпециально для тех, кто хочет составить свою собственную программу тренировок, доступен полный список упражнений. В приложении доступны занятия по четырем категориям – ноги, руки, пресс и все тело. Каждое упражнение можно просмотреть отдельно – для этого вам будут доступны видеоролик и краткая инструкция по выполнению.\n\nВ приложении есть возможность настройки уведомлений – так вы точно не забудете потренироваться, ведь напоминания будут приходить ежедневно!\n\nПоскольку одной из важных составляющих здорового образа жизни является контроль водного баланса в организме, приложение поможет понять, сколько воды вам необходимо выпивать ежедневно. Введите в настройках ваш пол, возраст и вес, после чего нужный объем воды автоматически появится у вас на экране. Вам останется лишь отмечать в приложении каждый выпитый стакан воды – так в течение дня вы в любой момент сможете понять, достаточно ли жидкости вы употребляете.\n\nС нашим приложением вы сможете добиться колоссальных результатов всего за месяц регулярных тренировок! Работая над своим телом, вы прокачаете его до тех результатов, о которых вы всегда мечтали. Пришло время выбрать новый путь в жизни – стать бодрее, красивее и, самое главное, здоровее!\n\n\nУсловия подписки: \n• 999 р.

That’s why Google Fit collaborated with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the American Heart Association (AHA) to bring you Heart Points, an activity goal that can help improve your health.\n\nActivities that get your heart pumping harder have tremendous health benefits for your heart and mind. You’ll earn one Heart Point for each minute of moderate activity like picking up the pace when walking your dog, and double points for more intense activities like running. It takes just 30-minutes of brisk walking five days a week to reach the AHA and WHO’s recommended amount of physical activity shown to reduce the risk of heart disease, improve sleep, and increase overall mental wellbeing.\n\nGoogle Fit will also help you:\n\nSEE YOUR WORKOUTS\nGet insights and see stats such as heart rate, speed, pace, route, and more for your runs, walks, and bike rides.\n\nMONITOR YOUR GOALS\nSee your daily progress on your Heart Points and steps. Meeting your goals all the time? Easily adjust your goals to keep challenging yourself to achieve a healthy heart and mind.\n\nMAKE EVERY MOVE COUNT\nAll physical activity can help you lead a healthier life, and with Google Fit you can track it all in one place. Working with your favorite fitness apps and devices, Google Fit builds a journal of your activity. And to make sure Fit never misses a workout, you can manually add any activity your other apps didn’t track - from Aerobics to Zumba!\n\nCONNECT WITH YOUR FAVORITE APPS AND DEVICES\nGoogle Fit can show you info from many of your favorite apps and devices that are compatible with Apple Health to give you a holistic view of your health, so you’ll never lose track of your progress. These include Lifesum, Runkeeper, Strava, MyFitnessPal, Headspace, and more.\n\nCHECK IN AT ANYTIME, FROM ANYWHERE\nSee a snapshot of your activity history across Google Fit and your integrated apps in your journal.

We recommend splits as part of your exercise routine, especially if you’re doing activities such as running or biking.\n\nPlease get your muscles warmed up before doing the splits.

      "label": "'Methylisothiazolinone' but what is that ?\n\nSavonnette is still not installed on your phone? QUICK QUICK QUICK ! Savonnette is there to help you understand your consumption of cosmetic products and offer you better and cleaner products for your body health and our planet's health thanks to a scan, statistics and a virtual beauty box.\n\n\nDo you want to know more about Savonnette? Here are some of the features of the application:\n\n- Your closet: If you want to understand the products composition that compose your bathroom cupboards, you just have to scan them and then save them in your closet. You can do as many as you want! This will then allow you to have statistics in order to know your consumption of harmful ingredients, follow your progress more easily and tend towards a cleaner, greener consumption, for your body heath and for our planet\n\n- A virtual beauty box: You will regularly discover, in this box, cosmetics from responsible brands that offer cleaner products that are better for your body health and for our planet. All the compositions are decrypted even in this box\n\n- A scanner to allow you to scan your cosmetic products in order to know everything about them, to know their origin: The composition, the dangerousness of the ingredients for your body health and for our planet, their origin, their function, their frequency of use. I'm also trying to teach you a little more about the composition to know how to decrypt them more easily, to act cleaner. And if you don't have the product to scan it, you can always search manually and have access to its composition.\n\n- A history: You will find there all the scans that you have done or the products that you have consulted. If you have a crush on a cleaner product just add it to favorites.\n\n- Access to all features anonymously: No account needed! And thanks to a QRcode you will always have access to your favorite products, your history, your box, your closets.\n\nAt Savonnette we want to support you towards more responsible consumption: consumption that allows you to pay attention to the health of your body but also to the health of the planet. Let me explain: In a world where we swim in information flows, where time is precious and where our body health and our planet health are most important, we want, thanks to all this information, to propose the most suitable and appropriate cosmetic products.\n\nSo do you want to participate in your well-being ?

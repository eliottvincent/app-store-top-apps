      "label": "Whether you’re working with teammates on a project or planning a weekend activity with loved ones, Microsoft Teams helps bring people together so that they can get things done. It’s the only app that has chats, meetings, files, tasks, and calendars in one place—so you can easily connect with people and bring plans to life. Get family and friends together to manage tasks at home or plan a surprise birthday party. Work with teammates via secure meetings, document collaboration, and built-in cloud storage. You can do it all in Microsoft Teams. \n\nEasily connect with anyone: \n• Meet securely with teammates, family, and friends. Set up a video meeting within seconds and invite anyone by sharing a link or calendar invite. \n• Chat 1-1 or in group chats with friends or colleagues. @mention people in chats to get their attention. \n• Dedicated channels help create a focused workspace for important projects. \n• Video call anyone directly in Teams or instantly convert a group chat to video call. \n• GIFs, emojis, and message animations make it easier to express yourself when words aren’t enough. \n\nAccomplish plans and projects together: \n• Task lists allow you to stay on top of work projects or plans with family and friends.

The dynamic between the “normal” web-based version of Shopify, and the mobile app, is amazing, with little to no changes (Except the size being scaled down of course.)“\n(Source: https://ecommercenewshq.com/the-complete-shopify-mobile-app-review/)\n\nReview from David B via g2.com\n“Shopify [..] allows me to do important things for my store from anywhere. That is because it gives me advantages in managing the store from a mobile device.”\n(Source: https://www.g2.com/products/shopify/reviews/shopify-review-2822877)\n\nABOUT SHOPIFY\nShopify’s ecommerce app can keep your business moving quickly. In the fast-paced world of ecommerce, that speed can be the difference between a sale for you or for your competitor.  \n\nShopify has everything you need to start selling online, for any ecommerce business. Start your business today on the one platform with the ecommerce and point of sale features to start, run, and grow your business."

He describes one of his pickup experiences below: “While picking up two diffusers, one customer noticed that our store smelled great and asked what product we were using. On top of their Wish Pickup order, they ended up buying 6 items including the scent sachets we use in our store, essential oils for the Wish diffusers, and some items that were near checkout!”\n\nReach new users\nFrom Miami to Berlin to Paris, Wish has millions of users all around the world.

Okta Verify does not store personal information - we request permission only for your device camera, which is used to scan a QR code to register your device with Okta.\n\n\nApp Features\n\n* Enroll in Okta Verify as a new user by registering your mobile device with your Okta account.\n* Add one or more Okta accounts that require Okta Verify for authentication.\n* Manage 2-factor authentication for non-Okta applications and web services that require the use of passcodes.\n* Approve or deny sign-in requests on your device from a push notification (if enabled).\n\n\nFor more information, check out our docs at:\nhttps://help.okta.com/en/prod/okta_help_CSH.htm#ext_okta_verify"

      "label": "Being away from your computer doesn’t mean you have to miss out on online events. The free GoToWebinar mobile app lets you not only see and hear webinars, but take part in them as well. No matter where you are, you can ask questions, take part in polls and more. If you’re running the webinar, you can present directly from your iPad, share your iPad’s webcam and chat with other event staff.\n\nFEATURES\n\nFor Attendees\nAttend and participate in online events while you’re on the move.\n   •  Join easily by tapping the online event link in an invite email or your calendar.\n   •  Use a single tap to dial in to the phone conference or connect to audio using WiFi or 4G/3G.\n   •  View the event speaker’s slide presentations up close.\n   •  Participate in polls, raise your hand and ask the event speaker a question.\n   •  View up to 6 webcams on any iOS device. \n\nFor Organizers\nIn addition to the above, as an organizer you can\n   • Schedule Webinars\n   • View previously scheduled Webinars\n   • View the number of registrants for an upcoming Webinar\n   • Share a Webinar registration link via email, SMS, twitter, facebook and more.\n\nFor Panelists\nIn addition to the above, as a panelist you can use your iPad to\n   • Share your webcam\n   • Share a document from your favorite cloud storage app\n   • Chat with other panelists and organizers\n\nHOW TO JOIN AN EVENT\nThere is no purchase necessary to attend a GoToWebinar event. Two easy ways to join:\n   • Tap an event link in the invite email or your calendar.\n   • Tap the GoToWebinar icon after you download the app and enter the session ID.\nNOTE: Presenter controls can be passed to anyone in the event if they have content to share. If you’re using an iPad, you can access and present content stored on cloud services.\n\nAUDIO\n   • Upon joining an event, you will automatically connect to audio through your Internet connection (WiFi or 4G/3G).\n   • For the best audio experience, plug a headset into your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch.\n   • If you prefer to dial in over your phone line, you can do that with a single tap after joining the event. \n   • If you are attending the event in person, easily disconnect from audio any time so you can continue to participate in polls and see the speaker’s presentation up close.\nNOTE: Due to network constraints, iPhone users on the Verizon network will be unable to join the event and dial in over the phone at the same time.\n\nVIDEO CONFERENCING\nIf additional presenters are using webcams, you will automatically see them upon joining the event. \n   • GoToWebinar presenters can turn on webcams by tapping the webcam icon then the Share My Webcam button.\n   • While it is possible to stream video over a 4G/3G connection, WiFi is recommended to avoid charges with your network carrier."

      "label": "Shopping is always a fun experience. However, customer satisfaction and trust are essential ingredients for successful long-term customer-supplier relationships. Usually, customer satisfaction originates from a user’s comparison of post-purchase and post-usage evaluation of a product with the expectations held prior to purchase. Sometimes this practice may lead to fall into the counterfeit market trap. Today, unauthorised distributors, retailers and online shops, which may sell fake merchandise without scruples, fool more and more users. Validactor deals with critical issues by providing a powerful product authentication APP that helps users to check for original items even before purchasing.\n\nHow It Works:\n\nThe validation process is a very easy one-step task; it works with each kind of product that has been authenticated through the Validactor QR Codes by its manufacturer.\nYou have just to scan the QR Code on the product label and you’ll immediately get confirmation on the product authenticity in addition to other information, such as brand details, manufacturing date, expiry date and current market status.\n\nWhat's New:\n\nValidactor is unique in providing totally integrated and customisable solutions that enable manufacturers to authenticate and safely protect their products. Either you are a brand enthusiastic or a natural products buyer, you don't need to scratch label, scan bar code or manually input the PIN code to perform product authentication. The intuitive Validactor APP interface will ease out your decision-making process by offering you a completely new approach to the purchasing experience. Validactor APP digital platform offers multi-dimensional features including:\n\n•\tDetailed product information\n•\tExtensive product flagging\n•\tProduct rating display\n•\tWidespread social sharing\n\nBy using the Validactor APP you’ll improve your purchasing experience other than contribute to enforce the following activities: \n\n•\tGet full control on distribution channels\n•\tPrevent brand theft\n•\tAvoid counterfeits in supply chain\n•\tPrevent product losses\n•\tRetrieve lost market share\n•\tEnhance customer loyalty with referral and reward programs"

      "label": "## Top productivity app in 136 countries. More than 2 million satisfied paying users. Featured in Apple's \"Amazing Apps\" TV commercial.\n## Staying focused with the cutest gamified timer. \n## Over 800,000 real trees were planted on Earth by our users.  \n\n\"Forest works well, and if your goal is to be more in the moment, ignore your phone and actually talk to your friends when you are with them, this is the app for you.\"— The New York Times \n\n\"In order to establish new, better habits, it's helpful to engage with tools that make it easier to reinforce them. For anyone looking to curtail their phone usage, the Forest app might be for you.\"— Business Insider\n\nIf you want to temporarily put down your phone and focus on what’s more important in real life, you can plant a seed in Forest. As time goes by, this seed will gradually grow into a tree. However, if you cannot resist the temptation of using your phone and leave the app, your tree will wither. \n\nThe sense of achievement and responsibility will encourage you to stay away from your phone, and will help you make better use of your time. Stop getting distracted by your phone, make you self-motivated and get more things done.\n\nStay focused. Be present! \n\nSTAY FOCUSED\n• A interesting way to help you beat phone addiction and overcome distraction\n• Turn your focused moments into a lush forest.\n• Create personalized Allow Lists for different situations. Non-allowed apps will be blocked.\n\nGET MOTIVATED\n• Earn rewards and unlock more than 50 new tree species and white noises.\n• Share your forest and compete with friends and users around the world.\n• Plant trees along with friends & family.\n• Unlock achievements and earn extra rewards.\n• Plant real trees on Earth and protect the environment with tree-planting organization Trees for the Future.\n\nSTATISTICS\n• Manage your own tags and view detailed statistics of your time distribution.\n• Browse your weekly, monthly and even your yearly big forest.\n• Track your focused time in the Apple Health App.\n• Track your daily phone usage and screen time.\n• Recall memories of your planting journey with our brand new Forest Timeline!\n\nIt's never to late to build up productive habits! \n\nNOTICE\n• Forest is an app available for both iPhone and iPad, and can be accessed across all iOS devices with a one-time purchase. To download or unlock non iOS version of Forest, this requires a separate purchase. However, by logging into the same account, the account data can be synchronized across all platforms.\n• Due to budget constraint, the number of real trees each user can plant is limited to five. We will be introducing limited time events that will allow users to plant more real trees. Please follow our social media page or check the in-app announcement for more updates.\n• There is only one version of Forest on the App Store. Other apps that are similar and mimics Forest are not developed by the Forest team.

Please do not use VPN, Proxy, VLANS and Subnets.\n\n* Latency is supreme (below 1 second) when you have good wifi network conditions\n\n* No hidden subscriptions or costs\n\n* Sound is not yet supported, but we are working on it. Please use Bluetooth speakers as a workaround.\n\n* Black screen issues: Some third party apps prevent screen mirroring. When you try to mirror them, you will just see a black screen on your TV, for example with Netflix and Disney+. This is a restriction chosen by Netflix and others, so we cannot fix it at the moment.\n\n\nIf you like the app and our constant work on it, please give the app a positive rating on the App Store.

      "label": "First released in 2009, GoodReader® is truly a veteran of the App Store.\n\nIn the modern app business, it's not easy to stay relevant that long. We're proud to say that after 13 years and counting, we've been delivering wonderful updates with extraordinary new features. And we're going to keep doing that!\n\nGoodReader is a perfect combination of document-reading and file-managing capabilities. It's your one-stop shop for all your document needs on your iOS device.\n\nUse the app once, and you'll be hooked. Soon you'll be wondering how you ever managed to work without it.\n\n-= File Reading =-\nPDF, TXT, MS Office, iWork, HTML, pictures, music & audio-books, videos. This is what you can view in GoodReader, plus you can also annotate PDF files and edit TXT files.\n\n-= PDF Reading and Annotating =-\nPDF files is where GoodReader truly shines. Reading experience is so superior, it's hard to describe. To rephrase one of our customers' review, \"try it, and you'll see.\" While you're at it, give our PDF Reflow feature a try. You'll be surprised how much better PDF reading goes when you don't have to scroll left/right all the time, for every single line of text.\nAnnotating PDFs is another star feature of our app. Adding notes and drawings, highlighting text, and then sharing your annotated files or annotation summaries will be your main productivity and collaboration asset.\n\n-= File Management =-\nWhile reading files is a big part of GoodReader, it's not all it can do. It can also serve as a central hub for all your files, even those that can't be opened by GoodReader itself. It's like bringing your personal computer experience to your mobile device — easily managing huge collections of files and folders will make you forget you don't have your laptop around.\n\n-= Connecting =-\nDropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive, Box.com, WebDAV, SMB, AFP, FTP, SFTP — these are all accessible from inside GoodReader. Download, upload, and sync (*) individual files or huge folder collections.\n\n-= Security =-\nWith GoodReader, your data security steps up to the level previously only dreamt of. With Pro Pack® (*), our new set of professional-level super-features, you'll get AES-256, a military-grade encryption, for all your data, at a price of a cup of coffee! And it's completely independent from the built-in Apple's Data Protection, so even if a hacker steals and unlocks your device, your data will still be protected by another strong layer of security, our own.\n\n-= Split-Screen =-\nThis wonderful feature allows you to split (*) an iPad screen in half, to read two files side-by-side. And even two different parts of the same file!\n\n(*): This feature requires a subscription to Pro Pack®, sold separately from inside the app as an in-app purchase."

Contacts Optimizer will deeply analyze your phonebook, deduplicate it, fix all possible issues and bring it close to perfection. The built-in intelligence will surprise you. Contacts Optimizer will save you hours of work and is one of a few apps which quickly pays for itself. Users say it is so useful it should be preloaded on every phone. This application is extremely popular on other platforms, now available fully featured for iOS!\n\nContacts Optimizer has powerful features, while its beautifully simplified design allows everybody to use it. Here is the list of features:\n\n• Find all possible duplicates and even similar contacts\n• Move contacts between different accounts, such as iCloud, Exchange, Gmail\n• Mass copy contacts between accounts\n• Mass delete contacts you no longer need\n• Powerful editing of contacts\n• Can't find a newly created contact? List all contacts sorted by modification date!\n• Display all upcoming birthdays for your contacts\n• Search and replace enables mass changes in contact names, country codes, notes, emails and all other fields\n• Easily remove birthdays of contacts of which you do not want reminders\n• Filtering of contacts provides you an easy way to work with a group of contacts\n• Automatic and manual merge contact fragments into one rich contact\n• Add international prefixes and country codes where needed so you can call from abroad\n• Correct and nicely format phone numbers\n• Smart capitalization, for names such as McDonald etc.\n• Locate potentially incorrect contacts which cannot be dialed\n• Find all incomplete contacts that have an important contact field empty\n• Clean contacts removing empty fields\n• Manage photos for contacts\n• 3D Touch support with important shortcuts\n\nWhat users say:\n* Try it, it's number 1\nI can say with confidence it's amazing app It saved a lot of my time since I have most of my contacts without country code Now all setup well Thank you\n\n* Excellent app\nI rarely rate 5 stars. This one deserves them! I have tried many contacts managers and so far this app beats them all. I like its ability to fix the phone format, adding the + sign and converting the letters to digits. I strongly recommend while it is free.\n\n* Tech masterpiece\nMost advanced and sophisticated app for contacts management! - luck of understanding of short local numbers - luck of understanding abbreviation\n\n* Amazing App\nThis app is amazing, it helped me delete, clean and simplify my address Book without having the need to sync to my laptop. For a person who's a bit OC this will unify the look and format of your contacts easily! Love it\n\n* Very Happy\nI have used many contacts optimizers in the past, but in my opinion this is the best one that I have ever used. It's very clear to me what is occurring as it is, and my address book with many entries survived intact and improved!\n\n* Best contacts optimising app ever\nI was struggling to remove duplicate contacts from my phone.i downloaded 10 other apps.but this is the one which does the work best. Thankyou\n\n* Better than perfect \nJust takes 10 minutes to clear my 5000 duplicate contacts. Must use app."

You start to notice small wins every day and build up momentum, creating a virtuous cycle.\n\nMeta Journal gives a weekly view of your achievements list and allows you to track any entries throughout the week. Achievements, Mistakes, or Thoughts, all of them support auto-completion based on your previous entries. In addition, keep everything clean and tidy with multiple areas: Work, Relationships, Health, Finance, and more.\n\nMaintaining the list has never been easier with auto-suggestions. It’s combining multiple sources like your Health app to suggest activity achievements like taking a walk, going for a swim, or monitoring your sleep and meditation practices.\n\nAt the end of the week, spend 5 minutes reviewing the past few days and everything you have accomplished. What are the key achievements? Which one do you wish to remember? How was your mood? Take notes with regular reviews. You will get a precise and accurate picture of the whole year that just passed.\n\nTo be even more intentional:\n- Try to set up goals, milestones, and tasks.\n- Instead of focusing on the main goal that can be overwhelming, focus on monthly milestones.\n- Take smaller steps that are achievable will help you progress.\n\n# Other features\n· Search your best memories\n· Daily mood tracker\n· GitHub integration to suggest project releases\n· Reminders\n· Photo uploads\n· Export your data to CSV format\n\n# Integration\n· Dark mode\n· Home widget\n· Siri shortcut\n· Wind-down\n· HealthKit (Mindful session, sleep, workouts…)\n· iCloud sync between devices\n· Face ID or Touch ID biometric lock to keep the journal private\n· CreateML for Machine Learning and classifying accomplishment and mistake\n\n——————\n\n# About subscription pricing and terms\nThis app provides a subscription to unlock unlimited usage, payments are charged to your iTunes account, and your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours before the end of the current period.

Also, the very fact that they require a live internet connection makes them very slow to use.\n\nBeing a native iPhone application, Pocket Luach allows for quick and simple conversion of dates on the go. This is useful for any observant Jew or for Gentiles doing business with observant Jews. For instance, with Pocket Luach, one can quickly make sure a proposed date for an appointment does not fall on a Jewish holiday before finalizing the date."

Now you can scan and OCR your letter-size or A4 documents with an accuracy of 90% or more, edit, copy and store the recognized text, and e-mail your documents as PDF files with text, SINGLE page image, or both together!\n\nNOTE: To ensure the advertised results it is important that you follow the OCR TIPS below (or in the app's help). \n\n\"It worked great for me! I translated a whole story in spanish using the espanol language preference and then I copied and pasted it into a translator to get the whole story in English!\"\n\"This app is really very good and I find it to be very accurate!\"\n>> Perfect OCR users.\n\nPerfect OCR scans your documents using advanced image-processing algorithms to eliminate uneven lighting and shadows and improve contrast. The result is the clearest and most readable scans possible from the iPhone's camera. Perfect OCR also offers SureScan, our proprietary scanning mode that delivers sharper images with less jitter or smear. \n\nOur unique \"Email to myself\" feature lets you send documents to a predefined address, or even upload them to an online storage service like Evernote or Box.net, with a single tap. Uploading documents to online services via email is fast, secure, and can be done even if you're temporarily off line. Refer to app help for details.\n\nAll processing happens on your iPhone, and the confidentiality of your data is never compromised. There is also no subscription fee, and no Internet access is needed to scan documents or run OCR.\n\n\nPERFECT OCR FEATURES:\n• Letter-size or A4 page OCR with accuracy of 95% for model 3GS, 98% for iPhone 4, and up to 90% for 3G\n• OCR languages: English, French, Spanish, German, Dutch, Italian, Portuguese, Swedish, Russian, Polish, Hungarian, Czech and Ukrainian.\n• Email multipage PDFs with text, SINGLE page image, or both\n• Automatic document edge detection and perspective correction\n• Multipage text recognition with accuracy indicator\n• Text editing and copy-to-clipboard operations\n• Built-in OCR text archive with file sharing via iTunes\n• \"Email to myself\" feature\n• Email text and image files (.TXT + .JPG), or save image to library\n• Searchable PDFs with document images (single page)\n• Preserves simple text formatting\n• Option to auto-remove line breaks\n• SureScan mode for jitter-free scans\n• Simple yet powerful user interface\n• Instant brightness, rotation, and color controls\n• Compact attachments with adjustable size\n\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS FOR OCR:\n• Make sure your document is flat and well lit. Hold your iPhone still while shooting. \n• Always scan documents using \"SureScan 3x\" mode.\n• Glossy paper may not work well (avoid glare).\n• When scanning books keep the pages as flat as possible and your iPhone parallel to the surface.\n• Perfect OCR cannot recognize handwritten, very large text or spreadsheets correctly.\n• Make sure to select the right language for OCR in app settings.\n\n\nWe're constantly improving Perfect OCR, and we value our customers' opinions and feedback. Please contact us at support@turboscanapp.com. If you have a problem with our software, please contact us before submitting a comment to the app store. We can solve most of the problems, but we cannot respond to comments."

      "label": "iCircuit is the premier iPad and iPhone app for designing and experimenting with circuits and Arduinos. Its advanced simulation engine can handle both analog and digital circuits and features realtime always-on analysis. It is the perfect companion to students, hobbyists, and engineers.\n\nYou use it as you would any CAD program: you add elements, connect them together, and set their properties.\n\nBut iCircuit is unlike other CAD programs because it is always simulating. It's just like working with the real circuit. You do not stop to take a measurement or spend a lot of time configuring reports. Instead, you just play with the circuit as you normally would, with the power on!\n\nThere are over 70 elements you can use to build your circuits. The app has everything from a programmable Arduino, to simple resistors, to switches, to MOSFETS, to digital gates.\n\nThe app features a multimeter that you use to probe around the circuit to instantly read voltages and currents. If you want to see how a value changes over time, then you can add values to the built-in oscilloscope. The scope can simultaneously track many signals over time and features a touch interface to control the total time displayed and stacked and unstacked modes to easily compare signals. The scope can also display the Fourier transform of any signal so that you can see the performance of filters.\n\nSupported elements include:\n\n• Programmable Arduino using a subset of the C programming language\n• Signal generators, Voltage sources, Current sources, and Dependent sources\n• Resistors, Capacitors, and Inductors\n• Manual SPST/SPDT and DPST/DPDT Switches, Push buttons, and Relays\n• LEDs, Diodes, BJ Transistors, and MOSFETs\n• Audio simulation with Speakers, Microphones, Buzzers, DC Motors, and LEDs\n• ADCs, and DACs\n• Logic gates: AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR\n• JK and D Flip-flops\n• 38 7400 series digital parts \n• 78xx and LM317 voltage regulators\n• 7-segment display and driver\n• Antenna with simulated AM and FM signals\n\nYou can also create sub circuits to introduce new elements and componentize your designs.\n\nNo matter your skill set, you'll be playing with circuits in no time with iCircuit."

Keep in Sync**\nUse iCloud or Dropbox to keep your reminders and timers in sync across your iPhone, iPad and Mac.\n\n7. Works Offline, Completely Private\nThere is no account to sign up for. We don't store, and we can't access your reminders and timers. And you don't need internet to receive reminders.\n\n8. Accessible to Everyone\nAutomatically adjusts text size according to your system setting, and offers full VoiceOver support. Due is also localized in 17 languages.\n\n\n* By default, auto snooze repeats 5 times, and can be configured to repeat up to 10 times. Due can auto snooze any overdue items indefinitely when you launch Due or act on any of its notifications.\n** Sync on Mac requires Due for Mac (sold separately)\n\n\nWHAT'S THAT IN-APP PURCHASE ABOUT?\n\nWhen you purchase Due today, you will have access to every feature in the app today—no further purchase required.\n\nYou will also get access to all new features released one year from your date of purchase.\n\nThe optional Due Upgrade Pass subscription allows you to continue getting access to all new features released one year *after* your date of purchase.\n\nAnd here's the deal: Every feature that you have unlocked will remain available to you, forever—even if you stop subscribing.\n\nEven without a subscription, you'll always receive bug-fix and compatibility updates for free. These updates add support for the latest iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches. They also help ensure that Due continues to function well on the latest versions of iOS, iPadOS and watchOS.\n\nDue has a pretty good track record with that.\n\nTo illustrate: If you've purchased Due back in 2010 for your iPhone 3G running iOS 4, that very same app in 2022 is now optimized for iPhone 14 Pro Max running iOS 16. It even works on devices that didn't exist back then, such as the iPad Pro and the Apple Watch.\n\nTERMS & PRIVACY POLICY\n\nOur terms of use and privacy policy is available here: https://www.dueapp.com/terms.html\n\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\n\nDue requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad running iOS 12 or later."

No requiere conexión a internet porque todo los procesos son internos en tu celular.\n\nEntre las opciones puedes elegir si se modifican los números 01-800 o la marcación internacional 52-1 entre otros y aunque es poco probable que en tu celular tengas grabados números con 044 y 045 también tendrás la opción de modificarlos y por supuesto, agregar la  clave LADA de tu ciudad.\n\nSimula los cambios a tus contactos antes de modificarlos de acuerdo a ciertos criterios, por ejemplo, puedes previsualizar los números que comienzan con el prefijo 01 o si seleccionas otros filtros, podrás ver los cambios que se harán a esos números en particular como por ejemplo a los teléfonos que inician con +521\n\nSi dentro del mismo contacto tienes un número repetido, \"Nueva Marcación\" lo detecta y te lo muestra en una lista. No se detectan contactos duplicados sino teléfonos duplicados dentro del mismo contacto. Por ejemplo Juan N tiene guardados los números telefónicos 044 333-323-2424 y 333-323-2424, \"Nueva Marcación\" quitará el 044 del primero y marcará el segundo como duplicado.\n\nEn las ciudades de México, Guadalajara y Monterrey las claves de larga distancia son de dos dígitos y los números locales de ocho, pero en el resto del país las claves de larga distancia son de tres dígitos y los números locales de siete, no olvides añadir la clave de tu ciudad (de 2 o 3 dígitos) en la casilla correspondiente.\n\nTomo muy en serio la privacidad de las personas; esta aplicación no guarda ni transmite ningún contacto, nombre o número telefónico.\n\nNingún dato personal es recabado , los números telefónicos son leídos y modificados en tu teléfono y en ningún momento son transmitidos por ningún medio, todo los procesos son locales."

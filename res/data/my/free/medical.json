The app will help to track your contractions and determine when it's time to go to the hospital.\nIf you plan on having a home birth, the app will tell you what stage of labor you are in at any given moment.\n\nKeep track of your labor by tapping a single button at the start and at the end of each contraction. The Contraction Timer analyzes the duration and frequency of contractions and will notify you when it's time to go to the hospital.\n\nThousands of pregnant women around the world have become mothers using our app.\n\nAlways consult your doctor to orient yourself in terms of contraction frequency and duration.\nThis app is not a medical device and our recomendations are based on standard indicators. Your labor may occur differently. Therefore, do not rely exclusively on our app.\nIf the duration and frequency of contractions do not yet correspond to the necessary indicators but labor pains become unbearable, it is better to go to the hospital as soon as possible rather than give birth at home or on the way there. Trust what your body is telling you.\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, please email us at neumandev@gmail.com. Your feedback is very important to us."

      "label": "Join the millions of medical professionals who use MDCalc daily to support clinical decision making at the bedside. Since 2005, MDCalc has been the leading medical reference for the most relevant, up-to-date and widely-used clinical calculators that support evidence-based patient care. Registration is free and takes less than 30 seconds for full, unlimited access.\n\nMDCalc clinical decision support is created exclusively by board-certified physicians for use by physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, and medical students. The simple yet sleek app provides access to 550+ easy-to-use clinical decision tools including risk scores, algorithms, equations, formulas, classifications, dosing calculators, and more.\n\nWith a new enhancement, clinicians can now earn AMA PRA Category 1TM CME credits by simply reading the clinical content for 150+ calculators. The app will keep track of the CME credits earned in a personal dashboard, where users can also redeem credits for certificates and access their receipts for easy documentation. In order to redeem CME credits, users will need to sign up for a paid CME plan.\n\nUnique features, ideal for the busy practicing clinician:\n\n• Works offline and in limited connection settings. (CME tracking requires a connection.)\n• Fast and easy search and filter to discover new calculators.\n• Customizable lists for quick access: favorites, recently used, your specialty.\n• Auto-syncing between the website and app.\n• Quick toggle between US and SI units.\n• Error warnings and normal values to help avoid mistakes and improper inputs.\n\nOur exclusive “MDCalc Method” for selecting tools - including in-depth appraisal and validation of evidence AND clinical relevance - results in only the highest-quality tools to help you make better decisions and be more efficient in your workflow. And our network of academic and practicing physician experts create easy-to-digest content to reinforce decision making and support training:\n\n• Insights and advice from the EBM creators (e.g. Dr. Phil Wells’ on the Wells’ Criteria).\n• Expert content by specialists on use cases, pearls & pitfalls, results interpretation and more.\n• Synopses of the evidence from the original and validation research.\n\nFrom iMedicalApps in 2016: “The evidence based medicine (EBM) components of the medical app are what really set MDCalc apart from its peers... The MDCalc app gives brief summaries of the critical studies concerning the medical calculator, links to the studies on PubMed as well as “pearls/pitfalls”, “next steps” and expert commentary from the authors of the calculators.” - iMedicalApps “MDCalc app, the best online medical calculator is now an app”\n\nMDCalc clinical decision tools support 35+ specialties including cardiology, critical care/ICU, emergency medicine, endocrinology, gastroenterology, hematology, hepatology, infectious disease, internal medicine, nephrology, neurology, obstetrics, oncology, orthopedics, pediatrics, primary care, psychiatry, pulmonology, surgery, urology, and more! Here are some examples of the tools:\n\n* Calculators that include CME content\n\n» Creatinine Clearance (Cockcroft-Gault Equation)\n» CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk\n» Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia\n» MELD Score (Model For End-Stage Liver Disease) (12 and older)\n» HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk\n» CHADS2 Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk\n» HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events *\n» SIRS, Sepsis, and Septic Shock Criteria *\n» Fractional Excretion of Sodium (FENa)\n» Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) *\n» Wells’ Criteria for Pulmonary Embolism *\n» Wells’ Criteria for DVT"

You can book appointments and chat with YOUR doctor, rather than a random doctor that you are unsure of. You will be able to book appointments for your family and friends with your trusted doctor. You will be able to schedule home care visits with your doctor and his/her trusted providers. Soon you will also be able to buy products that your doctor has curated and screened for you. The key is trust.\n\nAppointment bookings are secure and in real time. Your trusted doctor’s available time slots can be viewed from the app and you can choose the date, time and location to suit your convenience. Booking can be done 24/7 anytime, anywhere. You will receive reminders of your upcoming appointments and can view previous appointments. Reschedule or cancel your appointments through the app (within specified time limits). \n\nChat with your trusted doctor. Maybe you have a quick question that doesn’t need a trip down to the doctor. Your trusted doctor knows you and your medical history. He or she will be the best person to give you advice. With MaNaDr, you can quickly open a chat or a video consult with your trusted doctor. At the end of the chat, get a summary report from your doctor.\n\nNeed a home visit? Not just a doctor’s visit, but perhaps for nursing care, physiotherapy or other home care services? Look for your trusted doctor’s home care provider and book an appointment directly.\n\nChildren and the elderly without mobile devices are not left out. Add them as your family or friends and book appointments on their behalf.\n\nMaNaDr aims to be the one app for you and your family’s healthcare needs, from infancy to the golden years. For now, we connect you to your trusted healthcare provider but there will be much more to come. Stay tuned!\n\nYour healthcare data is secure. All communication between the mobile apps and our servers are secured by 256 bit SSL. \n\nThis app is currently applicable only in Singapore, Malaysia and Australia.\n\nBooking fees and consultation charges may apply."

They need accurate information about the hazardous substances, the emergency resources available, and the surrounding environmental conditions to save lives and minimize the impact on the environment and physical property. The WISER application extracts content from PubChem, an authoritative, peer-reviewed information resource maintained by the National Library of Medicine, and places that information into the hands of those who need it most. \n\nFeatures of WISER \n\n* Rapid access to the most important information about a hazardous substance by an intelligent synopsis engine and display called “Key Info” \n\n* Intuitive, simple, logical user interface developed by working with experienced first responders \n\n* Comprehensive decision support, including assistance in identification of an unknown substance and, once the substance is identified, guidance on immediate actions necessary to save lives and protect the environment \n\n* GIS support provides for isolation/protective distance overlays on a map of the incident \n\n* Access to NLM’s PubChem and Chemical Hazards Emergency Medical Management (CHEMM) content, which contains a wealth of detailed, peer-reviewed information on hazardous substances\n\n* Interactive chemical reactivity data, allowing WISER to predict hazards caused by a user prescribed mix of chemicals\n\n* User Profiles enable users to specify the role they are currently playing at the scene of an incident: first responder, HAZMAT specialist, EMS specialist, hospital provider, or preparedness planner. The key information presented to the user about a substance varies depending on this role, so that the information most relevant to the respective job can be quickly accessed. \n\n* Radiological and biological substance support. \n\n* Tools and reference materials, including triage tools, radiological incident support, WMD response guidelines, and an electronic version of the ERG 2016\n\n* Mobile support, providing first responders critical information where they need it, when they need it."

Just follow these four simple steps: \n\n1.\tDownload the app\n2.\tRegister with your email address\n3.\tEnter child’s name, date of birth, gender, parental height and an optional picture\n4.\tTake a picture of the child next to an adult\n\nGrowth Charts\nPlot the growth of each child against local guidelines. Deviations and margins of error have been aligned with local experts\n\nGrowth Tracking \nMeasurements taken via the photo feature and those entered manually are plotted separately\n\nScreening & Referral\nIf the child’s measurements indicate a deviation, the app will automatically ask the parents to seek professional guidance\n\nSeek support \nIf growth deviations are detected, this module helps parents reach out to growth specialists. The app’s in-built maps functionality directs you to nearby childrens’ healthcare providers.\n\nTreatment module \nThe treatment module will be activated based on an access code provided by your physician. Setting up the Treatment Module lets patients create a treatment plan, track injections, follow up on reminders, and get an overview of their adherence to treatment and growth tracking. \n\nGrowth is an important indicator of their overall health and well-being. That’s why it is essential for parents to be actively involved and aware of their child’s height, weight and growth rate. Measuring your child regularly and to plot those measurements on a growth chart are important ways to track whether your child is growing normally.\n\nThe content and features are provided by Novo Nordisk for general information purposes only and does not provide individual treatment guidance.

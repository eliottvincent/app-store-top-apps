Hemos creado el SISTEMA DE ENSEÑANZA DE LA GRAMÁTICA más claro y sencillo, conveniente a los principiantes. No le hace falta adentrarse en los mínimos detalles de la gramática inglesa, ni leer libros de texto.

Cada regla gramatical del curso autodidacta Simpler es una instrucción corta que enseguida se refuerza con preguntas y prácticas.\n\n2. Hemos creado un SISTEMA sencillo y claro de MEMORIZACIÓN DEL VOCABULARIO INGLÉS. Aparte de la traducción, se visualiza una imagen especial que ilustra el significado de la palabra desconocida. Además, se le muestra un texto asociativo que acompaña la imagen y le permite idear sus propias asociaciones mnemónicas. El curso autodidacta Simpler organiza el repaso del vocabulario en intervalos que fueron calculados con la curva del olvido de Ebbinghaus. ¡Con Simpler su vocabulario de inglés se ampliará notablemente!\n\n3. Es imprescindible poder entender el lenguaje oral en inglés. Para ello, los audios de las frases fueron grabados por hablantes nativos, lo que es especialmente importante para aquellos que empiezan a estudiar inglés desde cero. Asimismo, creamos un apartado especial de audiciones que llamamos PRÁCTICAS. Después de estudiar las reglas gramaticales, se le ofrece una tarea auditiva con el fin de entender frases en inglés.\n\n4. Creamos un sistema de tareas de toda clase que llamamos ENTRENADOR. Incluye una gama de actividades variadas que suponen un entrenamiento de traducción de frases del español al inglés y viceversa. Además, las reglas están pensadas de tal manera que el estudiante pueda aprender a aplicarlas con facilidad. Las lecciones del Simpler no se pasan al olvido, gracias a que el ENTRENADOR incluya también actividades de lecciones anteriores.\n\n5. ¡EXCLUSIVIDAD! Historias policíacas en inglés adaptado. Le harán pensar en inglés, con ellas podrá ampliar su vocabulario y mejorar la destreza oral.\n\n6. ¡La eficacia está en la regularidad! Para mantener su motivación a aprender inglés, hacemos constancia de su TRABAJO A TODO RITMO. ¡Estudie todos los días y los resultados no se harán esperar!\n\n7. ¡Gane ESTRELLAS, desbloquee lecciones, trabaje a destajo y reciba regalos!\n\n==========================\n\nOPCIONES DE USO DEL CURSO AUTODIDACTA DE INGLÉS SIMPLER\n• La suscripción Premium le permite aprender inglés accediendo a todo el funcional de la app.\n• Después de confirmar la compra, el cargo se realizará desde su cuenta iTunes. \n• La suscripción se renovará automáticamente a no ser desactivada 24 horas antes del vencimiento del periodo actual.

However, there is a significant difference between memorizing vocabulary lists and speaking a language with confidence. Learning a language is about more than just the words.

We realize that a lot of people are buzzing and excited about option and high-frequency trading around the world,  so we have created a system with six leading veteran traders/ educators  to send  signals to the Swipe Option  users to assist them with their analysis In the markets\n\n  This  analysis platform is centred around different forex pairs, but is more focused on time expiration rather than volume moved in the market. The master traders  are doing the analysis  and sharing which pair, time, direction  and potential entry price and even including notes to add more clarity \n\n  the users can choose to copy and paste the information if they wish, but that is done at their own risk   \n\nFunctionalities include,  swiping past certain trades you don want, and going back into history to see how the trades panned out over time. Which allows the user an amazing experience   we believe this is a simple yet ground breaking idea  and it will change the way people learn.  Its applicable , simple and hands on !"

      "label": "Pronouns are an especially important and interesting part of speech. They point to a face, but they do not name it. Therefore, pronouns refer to English grammar and this topic cannot be ignored if you want to write and speak English fluently. Since there is no gender category in English, pronouns very often act as gender determinants. Now that you have realized the importance of this topic, you can start learning.\r\nAt first glance, the topic of pronouns in English seems simple, but there are some subtleties that need to be understood. For easy memorization of the use of pronouns in English, we have created our application.\r\nThere are many ways to learn English and English pronouns. We will use one of the most effective ways - learning English pronouns by reading texts and books.\r\nOur application offers you a large selection of texts and books on any topic. You can only read what you really like! Thus, you not only learn pronouns, but also get interesting information or read books in the original.\r\nBefore starting the training, you have the opportunity to choose exactly the type of pronouns that you want to learn (personal, reflexive, etc.). You can also learn all pronouns at once. Then you must choose a text or a book. Our algorithm will cut pronouns from the text. Now you need to carefully read the sentences and insert the correct pronouns. Thanks to the context, you can not only theoretically use the correct pronouns. Based on the surrounding words, you will understand why this or that pronoun is used in this case. This way of learning will help you replenish your vocabulary and quickly start using the learned pronouns and constructions in speech or writing.\r\nOur app also contains a short course on the grammar of the use of English pronouns. English grammar is divided by the type of pronouns and it will be convenient for you to find exactly what you need. The information is presented there briefly, but succinctly enough for you to systematize your knowledge.\r\nYou can use our app for self-study English or as an addition to your English textbooks. Regardless of your language level, our application will be useful and comfortable to use. Even if you are just starting to learn English pronouns or have an advanced level of English, you can easily read texts and books.\r\nSpend your free time with benefit and use our application, reading books improving your knowledge!"

      "label": "Pregnancy Test Quiz is an app, which will help you to know whether you are pregnant, thanks to a series of questions based on different pregnancy symptoms.\nIn addition to a complete pregnancy calculator, you will find different sections with relevant information concerning signs of early pregnancy in the app. You will find a section with a variety of home pregnancy tests, in addition to a wide range of tips, information about the pregnancy stages, first signs of pregnancy, teenage pregnancy, etc.\nImportant! To ensure that you are pregnant you should see a doctor or use a pregnancy test calculator from the pharmacy, since this app is merely informational based on different symptoms of pregnancy, but it doesn’t provide exact results.\n\nHow to use the app Pregnancy Test Quiz:\nIt is very easy to learn how to use this pregnancy test.\n1.- Once you have downloaded and opened the app, you will find 3 different options in the main menu of the app. On the one hand, you will find an online pregnancy test and on the other hand, 2 sections about home pregnancy tests and also tips about pregnancy signs.\n2.-Pregnancy quiz: This is the main tool of the app. Therein, you will have to answer a series of questions related to early pregnancy symptoms. At the end of the test we will show you a result based on the answers you have chosen. As we have already mentioned, this result is not fully reliable, this is why it is important to see a doctor to do a reliable pregnancy test.\n3.-Home testing: In this section we have prepared lots of articles related to home pregnancy tests that were used in the past.\n4.-Tips: Finally, we have prepared some articles with advice, tips and recommendations to make your pregnancy more bearable: which kind of food you should avoid during pregnancy, false pregnancies, when to take a pregnancy test, early symptoms of pregnancy, what to do when you are pregnant, etc.\n\nMain characteristics of the app Pregnancy Test Quiz:\nIf you use this app, you will surely ask yourself: How do I know whether I am pregnant? \n- This app enables you to do a pregnancy test online, quickly and easily. It is important not to confuse it with the pregnancy calculator. In this case it is a test to know whether you are pregnant or not. Doing this test is an option to have a rough idea, but if you really want to know whether you are pregnant it is important to see your doctor or to go to the pharmacy to do a reliable test.\n- You will find various tips related to pregnancy week by week and early signs of pregnancy, which will be very helpful.\nWe hope that you find this app helpful and that you liked it. In this case we would appreciate if you could give this app 5 stars. Please contact us if you can find any mistake or if you have any suggestions for improvement.\n\nInformation note: This tool should be used as informational assistance, but it should never be considered as a reliable result, since its effectiveness is not scientifically proven and the result is not precise."

The better you understand how well you are sleeping the more you are able to make changes in your routines to benefit your rest.  \n\nMy goal is to provide every Apple Watch owner with a free automatic sleep tracker that is simple and clear to understand.  For each night you get a straightforward report of how long you slept and how restful you were during the night.\n\nAUTOMATIC MODE:\n \nSimply wear your Apple Watch overnight and each morning Sleep++ will analyze your sleep and give you a report about how long and restfully you slept.  \n\nMANUAL MODE:\n\nIf you want to have more precise control over the start/end time of each night recorded you can also use manual sleep tracking.  This is also useful if your nightly routine makes it difficult for Sleep++ to determine when you went to bed. \n\n1) Wear your Apple Watch while you sleep.\n2) Tell Sleep++ when you start sleeping.\n3) Tell Sleep++ when you wake up.\n\nNOTES:\n\nSleep++ integrates with the Health App providing you a safe and private way to share your activity data with Sleep++.  This data is used for automatic sleep tracking.  You can also optionally have Sleep++ save your Sleep Analysis into your Health database after each night."

You might feel anxious, constantly irritated, or even depressed. There is no shame in getting help while you get back on your feet. \n\nSensa is here to guide you through the entire journey to self-care, unlocking scientifically backed information to help you understand yourself better on your own terms.\n\nJust in 1–3 months, you will start your day with a new outlook on life.\n\nMeet your calm mind assistant:\n\n\nSelf-paced lessons\n\nHeal at your own pace and learn all about calming your mind with daily lessons about mental health.

Staring at pregnancy tests day after day to the point where you might even be seeing an imaginary second line? Get a little more assurance with the Pregnancy Test Checker app! With our neat little tool, you can take or import a photo of your pregnancy test stick and apply photo effects to make that (hopefully visible) second line easier to see. Current effects include brighten, contrast, grayscale, invert, exposure, gamma, hue, saturation and sharpen and we are continuing to work on adding more features!\n\nWe also provide a community where you can share photos of your tests or other TTC-related photos that other users can vote and comment on. You can also do the same for others!\n\nWe realize how stressful and frustrating the process of becoming pregnant can be, especially for those of you that have tried so hard and yearn for that pregnancy test to finally be positive after months or even years of disappointment. As such, we added a baby dust feature that we hope will provide a little comfort and encouragement to you during your journey to become pregnant.\n\nShould you run into any issues, we would sincerely appreciate it if you could send feedback to us first in the app instead of leaving a negative review and we will work to address your issue as quickly as possible.

Your BMI tells whether you’re fall in healthy, normal, overweight or obese category. So, simply add the values into the above calculator for bmi to learn what should my BMI be for my age? \r\nBasal Metabolic Rate (BMR):\r\nBMR is said to be as the total number of calories that your body needs to perform basic, life-sustaining functions. \r\nBMR is also said to as your body’s metabolism, thus, any increase to your metabolic weight, like exercise, will increase your BMR. So, simply try our basal metabolic rate calculator to calculate bmr, the number of calories that your body burn if you stayed in bed all day. \r\nBody Fat Percentage (BFP):\r\nThe BFP of an individual is said to be the total mass of fat divided by total body mass, and multiplied by 100, body fat consists of essential body fat & storage body fat. Remember that BFP is only body measurement that directly helps to find an individual’s relative body composition without regard to height or weight. Simply try the ideal body fat percentage calculator to know how much fat your body has!\r\nWaist to Height Ratio (WHR):\r\nThe WHR is said to be a measure of the fat distribution of body fat, simply it is considered to assess the fat content in human body. To track waist to height ratio, simply try our waist to height ratio calculator.\r\nTotal Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE):\r\nTDEE is referred to as an estimation of how many calories you burn each day when exercise is taken into account. Try our tdee calculator that allows you to calculate tdee corresponding to the activity level. \r\nEstimated Energy Requirement (EER):\r\nEER is said to be as the average dietary intake that is predicted to maintain energy balance in healthy, normal weight individuals.

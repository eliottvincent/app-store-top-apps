But the benefit is considerable. No longer tethered to your laptop, you can move around the room while still holding in your hand an image of what’s on the screen behind you. No more of that weird over-the-shoulder karaoke move when checking to see where you are in the presentation.\"\n\nGo to your next PowerPoint presentation IN STYLE with i-Clickr Remote for iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch!\n\nFeatures:\n\n* Complete control of your PowerPoint presentation including animations.\n* Record your presentation (slides and your voice audio) into a movie as you present.\n* Share PDF version of the presentation with audience via E-Mail.\n* View your slides AND slide notes directly on your iOS device during your presentation.\n* Navigate through your slides with finger swipes and taps.\n* Grab your audience's attention with real-time annotations (Windows only).\n* Help you track your presentation time with onboard clock.\n* Set presentation alarm so that your iOS device will alert you with a silent buzz before your time runs out.\n* Pause and resume presentations.\n* Switch between multiple slideshow.\n* Work with both Windows and Mac Office (see below for the Office versions supported), iWork '09 Keynote on Mac, and OpenOffice on Windows.\n* Easy to set up with zero configuration.\n* No additional cost when using with multiple host computers.\n* NEW: Control presentation from your Apple Watch.\n* NEW: Control external laser pointer.\n\nRequirement:\n\n* On Windows, support all versions of Microsoft PowerPoint (the free Microsoft PowerPoint Viewer is not supported).  Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows (version XP or above) is required at the host PC. \n* On Mac OS X, Office Mac 2004 or above, or iWork '09 Keynote is required.\n* WiFi connection between the host computer and your device, or connection using direct ad hoc network and the iOS’s personal hotspot.  \n* Also support the FREE OpenOffice 3.1 on Windows.\n\nTo download software required at your host computer (that is, the PC/Mac that will run your PowerPoint presentation), visit http://www.senstic.com/iPhone/iClickr/Download.aspx\n\n*** If you have problem getting i-Clickr to work, please contact us at support@senstic.com, and we will help you fix the problem."

The built-in Whois tool also shows you information about domains that are already registered.\n\nUse Dot-o-mator's Check tool to check the availability of any .com, .net or .org domain name. Just enter the domain name in the check field, and Dot-o-mator will show you if its available or taken. If the domain is already taken, you can view the Whois info to see who owns it and when it expires, or view the domain's website. If the domain is available, you can register it with the \"Register Now\" link (registration links open in Safari).\n\nWhen you find a name you like, you can save it to your Saved Names list. You can also e-mail one or all of your saved names to your email address. The email includes a link to register the domains with your favorite registrar.\n\nDot-o-mator's Name Generator creates names by combining words: the word you enter, plus a list of word endings. So if you enter \"quote\" in the word field, and select the \"Travel\" endings, you get names like \"quotejaunt.com\", \"quotetour.com\",  etc.\n\nThis app automatically checks the availability of all the generated names at the same time, so you can easily see which names are available! You can customize the Name Generator's endings lists by adding or removing words, and create your own endings lists for even more name combinations.\n\nThe Thesaurus tool gives you even more possibilities for names. Enter a word in the thesaurus field and tap \"Find Similar\" to get a list of related words, then tap on any of the resulting words to either define the word, check that word as a domain name, or use it in the Name Generator. There are thousands of possible combinations!\n\nVisit Dot-o-mator on the web at www.dotomator.com for more domain naming tips and tools."

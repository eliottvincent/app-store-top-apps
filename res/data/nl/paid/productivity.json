Featured in Apple's \"Amazing Apps\" TV commercial.\n## Staying focused with the cutest gamified timer. \n## Over 800,000 real trees were planted on Earth by our users.  \n\n\"Forest works well, and if your goal is to be more in the moment, ignore your phone and actually talk to your friends when you are with them, this is the app for you.\"— The New York Times \n\n\"In order to establish new, better habits, it's helpful to engage with tools that make it easier to reinforce them. For anyone looking to curtail their phone usage, the Forest app might be for you.\"— Business Insider\n\nIf you want to temporarily put down your phone and focus on what’s more important in real life, you can plant a seed in Forest. As time goes by, this seed will gradually grow into a tree. However, if you cannot resist the temptation of using your phone and leave the app, your tree will wither. \n\nThe sense of achievement and responsibility will encourage you to stay away from your phone, and will help you make better use of your time. Stop getting distracted by your phone, make you self-motivated and get more things done.\n\nStay focused. Be present! \n\nSTAY FOCUSED\n• A interesting way to help you beat phone addiction and overcome distraction\n• Turn your focused moments into a lush forest.\n• Create personalized Allow Lists for different situations. Non-allowed apps will be blocked.\n\nGET MOTIVATED\n• Earn rewards and unlock more than 50 new tree species and white noises.\n• Share your forest and compete with friends and users around the world.\n• Plant trees along with friends & family.\n• Unlock achievements and earn extra rewards.\n• Plant real trees on Earth and protect the environment with tree-planting organization Trees for the Future.\n\nSTATISTICS\n• Manage your own tags and view detailed statistics of your time distribution.\n• Browse your weekly, monthly and even your yearly big forest.\n• Track your focused time in the Apple Health App.\n• Track your daily phone usage and screen time.\n• Recall memories of your planting journey with our brand new Forest Timeline!\n\nIt's never to late to build up productive habits! \n\nNOTICE\n• Forest is an app available for both iPhone and iPad, and can be accessed across all iOS devices with a one-time purchase. To download or unlock non iOS version of Forest, this requires a separate purchase. However, by logging into the same account, the account data can be synchronized across all platforms.\n• Due to budget constraint, the number of real trees each user can plant is limited to five. We will be introducing limited time events that will allow users to plant more real trees. Please follow our social media page or check the in-app announcement for more updates.\n• There is only one version of Forest on the App Store. Other apps that are similar and mimics Forest are not developed by the Forest team.

Created by actors for actors, Scene Study frees you from the script to start actively listening and responding in the scene. By recording your cues lines, you practice listening for them right along with recalling your own. \n\nOnce you have a scene set up, save time by rehearsing while doing other activities. Combining other tasks with rehearsal enables deeper memorization of your lines and often provides a few unexpected insights to your character. \n\nGetting started is easy. Simply create a production, add characters, then start recording your character's spoken and cue lines. Record the full lines for your scene partners or just the cue lines. Then start rehearsing!\n\nChoose the character you wish to rehearse by muting them during playback and enjoy your own portable scene partner. Rehearse around the house or on the go, rehearse while driving or doing chores. It’s that easy! \n\nFeatures \n\n- Dress rehearsal mode!\n- Line prompting to speed memorization.\n- Streamlined recording interface.\n- Lock screen audio controls integration.\n- Great for single scene and full length productions.\n- Shared character lists for productions.\n- Streamlined scene screen enables playback and recording from one screen. \n- Playback all scene lines or mute a character to rehearse lines from memory.\n- Drag and drop line reordering.\n- Auto-save recordings for fast scene creation.\n- Headphone and bluetooth support for limitless rehearsal opportunities."

      "label": "“The biggest software advance for writers since the word processor.” —Michael Marshall Smith, bestselling author\n\nTypewriter. Ring-binder. Scrapbook. Scrivener combines all the writing tools you need to craft your first draft, from nascent notion to final full stop.\n\nTailor-made for creating long manuscripts, Scrivener banishes page fright by allowing you to compose your text in any order, in sections as large or small as you like. Got a great idea but don’t know where it fits? Write when inspiration strikes and find its place later. Grow your manuscript organically, idea by idea.\n\nWhether you plan or plunge, Scrivener works your way: meticulously outline every last detail first, or hammer out a complete draft and restructure later. Or do a bit of both. All text sections in Scrivener are fully integrated with its outlining tools, so working with an overview of your manuscript is only ever a tap away, and turning Chapter Four into Chapter One is as simple as drag and drop.\n\nNeed to refer to research? In Scrivener, your background material is always at hand. Write a description based on a photograph. Reference a video or PDF. Check for consistency with an earlier chapter. On the iPad, open two documents side-by-side; on the iPhone, flip between research and writing with just two taps.\n\nOnce you’re ready to share your work with the world, simply compile everything into a single document for printing, or export to popular formats such as Word, PDF, Final Draft or plain text. You can even share using different formatting, so that you can write in your favorite font and still keep your editor happy.\n\n\nFEATURES\n\nGet Started\n• Interactive tutorial project\n• Keep each manuscript and supporting materials in a self-contained project\n• Import Word, RTF, Final Draft and plain text files\n• Easily split imported text into separate sections\n\nGet Writing\n• Write your manuscript in sections of any size\n• View all sections as a single text using the “Draft Navigator” (iPad only)\n• Quickly navigate sections using the “binder” sidebar\n• Format with fonts and presets\n• Comments, footnotes, links and highlights\n• Simple bullets and lists\n• Insert images\n• Pinch-zoom to resize text\n• Full-screen mode (iPad only)\n• Typewriter scrolling mode keeps typed text center-screen (iPad only)\n• Write a screenplay using scriptwriting mode\n• Live word and character counts\n• Set word and character count targets\n• Find and replace\n• Customizable keyboard row provides quick-access buttons for formatting, navigation and punctuation\n• Comprehensive keyboard shortcuts for external keyboard users\n• Dark mode\n\nFind Your Structure\n• Write in any order and reorganize later\n• Write a synopsis for any text section and see it in the outline\n• Expand, collapse and drill down into sections of your project\n• Rearrange sections as index cards on the corkboard (iPad only)\n• Project-wide search\n• Track ideas using labels and status\n• Apply custom icons to your sections\n\nRefer to Research\n• Import research material such as image, PDF and media files\n• View research files or other sections right alongside your writing (iPad only)\n• Every section has its own notes area for jotting down ideas\n• Supports multi-tasking split screen mode (supported devices only)\n\nShare Your Work\n• Compile to a single document for sharing or printing\n• Use different formatting in your exported or printed document\n• Export to Word, RTF, Final Draft, PDF or plain text\n• Convert rich text to Markdown for sharing with Markdown apps\n• Create and email zipped backups of your projects\n\nWork Anywhere\n• Use Dropbox to sync between devices and with the macOS and Windows versions of Scrivener*\n• Copy projects between devices via iTunes\n\n* Requires a Dropbox account (not compatible with iCloud).\n\nSUPPORT\nYou can contact us at ios.support@literatureandlatte.com, visit our forums at http://www.literatureandlatte.com/forum, or find us @scrivenerapp on Twitter."

      "label": "Habeets is a simple habit-tracking app designed to help you achieve your goals and create a better version of yourself. If you want to create better habits (workout, eat healthily, save more money, etc), or ditch your bad ones (drinking, smoking, etc), Habeets can help you achieve that. You will still need to do the hard work, though...\n\nCORE VALUES\n- Form or ditch any type of habit\n- Easy to use\n- Packed with all the features you need\n- All your habits are for your eyes only. Neither I nor Apple can read your data.\n- No extra payments, subscriptions, or ads\n- Automatically synchronize your data across all your devices\n- Support for iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and Mac (Apple Silicon)\n- Beautifully crafted graphs and insights\n- Dark mode\n- Set reminders\n\n\nMAKE YOUR GOALS A REALITY\nShows how far you've come and how much you've improved. Encourages you to keep going when things get tough. Finally, break those bad habits that have been holding you back for years\n\nSIMPLE, EASY, AND FAST\nHabeets is a straightforward, simple, and elegant solution to help you in your journey, that will become part of your day.\n\nIMPROVE EVERY DAY\nTrack days that you missed or skipped, and make it work next time.\nForm all types of recurring habits: Weekly, Interval, and Customized.\n\nNO EXTRA PAYMENTS\nI believe that helping you achieve your goals is more important than anything else. Nowadays almost every app requires subscriptions or they just have ads everywhere.\nHabeets doesn't have any premium features. You'll receive all features already unlocked. No subscriptions, no additional payments, or ads.\nPay once, and use forever. That's it.\nHelping you become better and better by using this app is what matters to me.\n\nYOUR PRIVACY MATTERS\nHabeets is focused on privacy. We don't track you or your habits. We don't send any data to 3rd parties. Your habits data never leaves your phone or its iCloud backups. None of your habits data is saved to a server (except iCloud's servers).\n\nREMINDERS\nGo mind-free all day setting reminders for your habits. Set up an alarm for when you need to do something important like drink water or meditate. You'll never miss a chance to keep moving forward.\n\nANYTIME. ANYWHERE\nI designed Habeets so you can use it anytime, anywhere. From your iPhone, iPad, Mac, or Apple Watch. This will help you continue your habits wherever you go.\nFor example, you can use your Apple Watch to track habits when your iPhone is not around.\nAll your data is encrypted and automatically synched throught all your devices.\n\n\n\"Success is the product of daily habits, not once-in-a-lifetime transformations.\" - James Clear (Atomic Habits)\n\nThank you for reading until here. I wish you nothing but the best in your journey.\n\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/\nPrivacy Policy: https://habeets.com/privacy-policy/"

Sharp Mind induces optimized mental states ideal for school, exam preparation, confidence, problem solving, memory, creativity, confidence and learning. Combine Binaural Tones with iTunes Music, Audiobooks, Spotify * Built-in iTunes Playlist Creator * 17 Soothing Ambient Backgrounds and 10 Gentle Alarm Sounds. * Universal App * iPhone and iPad UIs HD&SD * Headphones/Earbuds must be worn for Binaural Tones to be Effective. \n\nTo combine Brainwaves and Ambience with Audio from Another App use Background Source option #5 on the Background Settings, 'Ambience + Other App'.  \n\nTo use just Brainwaves and Audio from Another App use the \"No Background\" option for the Background Source.\n\nWarning: These are powerful brainwave entrainment programs and should never be used while driving or operating machinery.\n\nBrainWave Sharp Mind is unlike any other brainwave entrainment application.  Other brainwave and binaural beat applications use only a single brainwave frequency and carrier signal.  The Sharp Mind Progressive Brainwave Entrainment algorithms use a series of brainwave programs, multiple frequencies and carrier waves to gently bring your brainwave frequencies to your desired state using a more natural and effective frequency progression.\n\n*** Advanced Features ***\n\n - Multiple Brainwave programs each specially designed to elevate you to a unique mental state.\n\n - Multiple ambient background sounds to choose from.\n\n - Adjustable Brainwave Intensity - The intensity of the brainwaves can be adjusted independently of the ambient background sound.  This allows you to set the brainwave volume to your comfort level.  The application will also save your preference for future use.\n\n - Adjustable ambient background volume.\n\n - Visual timer countdown indicator.\n\n - Automatic saving of preferred brainwave entrainment program and ambient background sounds.\n\n - Ability to create your own custom time option.\n\n\n*** Programs Included ***\n\n - Brain Energizer: Takes you through a series of brainwave programs and progressively elevates your level of alertness.\n\n - High Beta Concentration: Designed to put your mind into the ultimate state of focus and concentration.  Ideal when you need to block out surrounding distractions and study.\n\n - Creative Brainstorming:  A series of brainwave programs that elevates your mind to a state of open-mindedness and creativity.  Perfect for when you're stuck on a problem or are having difficulty coming up with an idea.  Sit back and plug into this program to completely open your mind.\n\n - Creative Problem Solving:  The ultimate combination of focus and creativity achieved through a series of brainwave programs and frequency mixes.\n\n - Gamma Memory Boost:  This program was designed to be used whenever you feel like taking a break and letting what you've just learned sink in.  This will help you maximize memory recall.\n\n - Beta Confidence Boost:  Designed to be taken before a test or presentation.  The other programs help you prepare, solve problems, come up with ideas and remember what you've learned.  \n\nSharp Mind also includes:\n\n- Creative Thinking\n- Lateral Thinking\n- Convergent Thinking\n- Deductive Thinking\n- Centered Mind\n- Focus/Concentration\n- Gamma Creativity Boost\n- Evening Memory Boost\n- Full Beta Spectrum\n- Full Gamma Spectrum\n\n* How Binaural Brainwave Entrainment Works *\n\nThis app uses advanced Binaural Brainwave Entrainment to stimulate brainwave frequencies associated with different states of mind.  These brainwave frequencies are in most cases inaudible and therefore must be induced through the use of binaural tones.  In this process two different tones are played, one for one ear, and one for the other (headphones or earbuds must be used).  When processing these two different tones the human brain perceives the difference as a beat matching the target brainwave frequency."

Persistent & Effective\nAuto Snooze repeatedly* notifies you of missed reminders until marked done or rescheduled. Choose between intervals of every 1, 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 minutes.\n\n2. Fast to Set, Fast to Postpone\nA time picker with 12 preset and fully customizable times lets you set due dates and postpone reminders in record time.\n\n3. Natural Date & Time Parsing\nDue can also parse dates and times that you typed or dictate and offer to set the due dates and times for you.\n\n4. Countdown Timers\nPrecise to the second, perfect for making the perfect soft-boiled eggs, brewing your coffee and more. Set them up once and reuse them forever\n\n5. Powerful Recurring Reminders\nFrom the simple daily and weekly reminders to the complex every-3rd-Wednesday-of-the-month kind of reminders\n\n6. Keep in Sync**\nUse iCloud or Dropbox to keep your reminders and timers in sync across your iPhone, iPad and Mac.\n\n7. Works Offline, Completely Private\nThere is no account to sign up for. We don't store, and we can't access your reminders and timers. And you don't need internet to receive reminders.\n\n8. Accessible to Everyone\nAutomatically adjusts text size according to your system setting, and offers full VoiceOver support. Due is also localized in 17 languages.\n\n\n* By default, auto snooze repeats 5 times, and can be configured to repeat up to 10 times. Due can auto snooze any overdue items indefinitely when you launch Due or act on any of its notifications.\n** Sync on Mac requires Due for Mac (sold separately)\n\n\nWHAT'S THAT IN-APP PURCHASE ABOUT?\n\nWhen you purchase Due today, you will have access to every feature in the app today—no further purchase required.\n\nYou will also get access to all new features released one year from your date of purchase.\n\nThe optional Due Upgrade Pass subscription allows you to continue getting access to all new features released one year *after* your date of purchase.\n\nAnd here's the deal: Every feature that you have unlocked will remain available to you, forever—even if you stop subscribing.\n\nEven without a subscription, you'll always receive bug-fix and compatibility updates for free. These updates add support for the latest iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches. They also help ensure that Due continues to function well on the latest versions of iOS, iPadOS and watchOS.\n\nDue has a pretty good track record with that.\n\nTo illustrate: If you've purchased Due back in 2010 for your iPhone 3G running iOS 4, that very same app in 2022 is now optimized for iPhone 14 Pro Max running iOS 16. It even works on devices that didn't exist back then, such as the iPad Pro and the Apple Watch.\n\nTERMS & PRIVACY POLICY\n\nOur terms of use and privacy policy is available here: https://www.dueapp.com/terms.html\n\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\n\nDue requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad running iOS 12 or later."

      "label": "Notebooks is a writing app, a text and markdown editor, your personal Wiki and Zettelkasten, a file organizer, task manager, PDF and eBook creator and more. This may sound like a lot, but consider you have a few text fragments, randomly created, which you want to combine into a chapter of a book and saved as PDF or eBook; or a quick note sparks off an idea, generates a couple of tasks, each of which requires you to organize further research material; or you have business related documents which need to be separated from private diaries, records and files. – With Notebooks you handle these jobs easily without switching apps, and while remaining focussed and creative.\n\n• Notebooks stores all your documents as regular files in standard formats. You are always in control of your documents, never need to worry about how to export them, and they remain compatible across devices and over time.\n\n• Create formatted documents with styles, attachments, tables or checklists, and add a table of contents if you like. Choose between a variation of ready made document styles, or create your own, if you want.\n\n• Write your documents in plain text and allow Notebooks to automatically handle lists, highlight and center the current line on screen, automatically insert closing characters for  (, {, [, \" and more. - Plain text is a universal format which can be used on any device without any specific software.\n\n• Use Markdown to create formatted documents from plain text. Notebooks supports *MultiMarkdown* and its own flavor of *Discount*.  – Click any word in a formatted Markdown text and start writing at that position. You can even create checklists (- [ ]) and tick them off in formatted view. Syntax highlighting and a set of dedicated extra keyboard keys make Markdown editing easy.\n  \n• Use your Apple Pencil to sketch ideas or annotate images and PDF documents.\n\n• Use Notebooks' advanced editing capabilities to work on documents which are stored in other apps.\n\n• Compile selected documents or the contents of whole books into a single document, an eBook or a PDF document.\n\n• Link between documents in Notebooks. In Markdown you can even use Wiki style links ([[ ]]). When clicking a link to a document which does not yet exist, Notebooks suggests to create it. And when you move or rename documents, Notebooks makes sure the links remain intact.\n\n• Create as many books as you need to structure your projects and details. Nest books as deep as you like, there is no limit in Notebooks. If you ever loose track, Notebooks' full text search helps you quickly turn up even the most hidden document.\n\n• Turn books into task lists to display document as tasks which can be ticked off. Assign due dates and alerts, and divide projects into nested sub projects, which makes them easier to handle. \n\n• For simple lists you can use checklists in formatted documents and Markdown.\n\n• Assign Context tags to books and documents to create shortcuts that are accessible for a smart book at Notebooks' top level. – Notebooks can even extract context tags from the contents of documents as you create them.\n\n• Import all documents and files you want to keep close at hand, no matter whether PDF, email, web pages, MS Office or iWorks, photos, videos, music and more.\n\n• Scan documents and extract text using OCR (iOS 13)\n\n• Sync files between iPads, iPhones, Mac or PC. \n\nWith all that, Notebooks may quickly become your one and only app for everything you want to keep close at hand.\n\nUser Comments: \n\n“Notebooks is a wonderful App, which is so much better than the dozen other note apps I tried. It is sophisticated, in an unassuming way, so that you find yourself greatly rewarded and being productive without sacrificing time/effort to the App. I cannot tell you how much productivity I have gained.  I am having a huge amount of fun, I use it constantly, more than the phone on my iPhone in fact.\" \n\n“You are GTD in every way that makes it efficient and makes me efficient.”"

      "label": "First released in 2009, GoodReader® is truly a veteran of the App Store.\n\nIn the modern app business, it's not easy to stay relevant that long. We're proud to say that after 13 years and counting, we've been delivering wonderful updates with extraordinary new features. And we're going to keep doing that!\n\nGoodReader is a perfect combination of document-reading and file-managing capabilities. It's your one-stop shop for all your document needs on your iOS device.\n\nUse the app once, and you'll be hooked. Soon you'll be wondering how you ever managed to work without it.\n\n-= File Reading =-\nPDF, TXT, MS Office, iWork, HTML, pictures, music & audio-books, videos. This is what you can view in GoodReader, plus you can also annotate PDF files and edit TXT files.\n\n-= PDF Reading and Annotating =-\nPDF files is where GoodReader truly shines. Reading experience is so superior, it's hard to describe. To rephrase one of our customers' review, \"try it, and you'll see.\" While you're at it, give our PDF Reflow feature a try. You'll be surprised how much better PDF reading goes when you don't have to scroll left/right all the time, for every single line of text.\nAnnotating PDFs is another star feature of our app. Adding notes and drawings, highlighting text, and then sharing your annotated files or annotation summaries will be your main productivity and collaboration asset.\n\n-= File Management =-\nWhile reading files is a big part of GoodReader, it's not all it can do. It can also serve as a central hub for all your files, even those that can't be opened by GoodReader itself. It's like bringing your personal computer experience to your mobile device — easily managing huge collections of files and folders will make you forget you don't have your laptop around.\n\n-= Connecting =-\nDropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive, Box.com, WebDAV, SMB, AFP, FTP, SFTP — these are all accessible from inside GoodReader. Download, upload, and sync (*) individual files or huge folder collections.\n\n-= Security =-\nWith GoodReader, your data security steps up to the level previously only dreamt of. With Pro Pack® (*), our new set of professional-level super-features, you'll get AES-256, a military-grade encryption, for all your data, at a price of a cup of coffee! And it's completely independent from the built-in Apple's Data Protection, so even if a hacker steals and unlocks your device, your data will still be protected by another strong layer of security, our own.\n\n-= Split-Screen =-\nThis wonderful feature allows you to split (*) an iPad screen in half, to read two files side-by-side. And even two different parts of the same file!\n\n(*): This feature requires a subscription to Pro Pack®, sold separately from inside the app as an in-app purchase."

TaskTask directly connects with your Office 365 Business, Exchange on-premises, or Google tasks to keep your full task list in sync between Outlook and your device. Everything is tracked, include all the advanced properties you can see in Outlook. Best of all TaskTask includes flagged items (email!) so you can see your complete task list on the go.\n\nUsing TaskTask, you can manage your to-do list, create tasks, set start/due dates, mark complete, assigning categories, change importance, set and receive reminders, and delete tasks. An Exchange Server or Office 365 account is required to synchronized tasks with Outlook. No additional software is necessary. TaskTask works with Gmail directly, although in a limited fashion.\n\nKey Features:\n- Simple interface, quickly create new tasks and mark tasks completed\n- Set task attributes, such as category, importance, start/due/complete dates, and notes\n- Synchronize your task list with your e-mail account (no hidden fees or software to download)\n- Quickly swipe to complete or delete a task \n- Easy set up with automatic configuration of your server\n- Drag-to-order your tasks, see the same order in Outlook\n- Recurring tasks and reminders\n- View attachments on your tasks and attach files from other apps\n\nHow is TaskTask better than Reminders?\n- See your task list how you prefer: organize by start date, due date, category, importance, or reminder date.\n- Reorder your tasks just by dragging them around\n- Full category support, including downloading your list of categories and colors from your Exchange Server.\n- See tasks in the same order as Outlook's To Do Bar\n- Task filters: filter out tasks in the future or tasks you don't want to see on your mobile device\n- Flagged mail items: See the full list of items from your To Do Bar, not just tasks\n- Quick Task Entry: Type a list of task subjects quickly in one space, and TaskTask automatically creates the set of tasks\n- Mark tasks as private: Hide tasks from others who have visibility to your task list\n\nNote: To synchronize your tasks with Outlook, your email account must be on a compatible Microsoft Exchange Server or Office 365 Business account. Microsoft Exchange Server 2010 and newer versions are supported, although there may be additional factors that prevent TaskTask from working with your server. \n\nIf you are using Mail.app or Microsoft Outlook 2011 (Macintosh) with your email account in \"Exchange\" mode, TaskTask is compatible with your server. Because there are specific requirements for your server, please verify with your e-mail administrator that your server meets these requirements before purchasing this app."

      "label": "CalenGoo gives you a fast and easy way to access and modify your Google Calendar with your iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad. It can also be used when you have no Internet connection, using the cached data. Changes are saved and uploaded the next time you are connected.\n\nThe calendar view is similar to the web view of Google Calendar. Events are displayed using the same calendar colors that you use in your Google Calendar, even Google's event colors are supported (please see http://www.calengoo.com/cc ). It also recognizes which calendars are visible and which are hidden. So the view should match the view of your Google Calendar as much as possible. \n\nCalenGoo also has a month view similar to that of Google Calendar. It can be zoomed and panned to quickly get an overview over the events of a month. Zooming the month is done by using the two-finger-zoom gesture that you know from Safari and the photo application. A double tap opens the tapped day.\n\nIt also supports the same kinds of recurrence rules as Google Calendar and displays recurring events correctly even when you are offline or scroll far into the future.\n\nYou can also use Google Calendar's feature to invite people to events and see their status (accepted, declined, maybe, no answer). They will get an invitation email with links to e.g. accept or decline the invitation.\n\nGoogle Calendar has an integrated task list, called Google Tasks. Tasks with a due date are displayed on the corresponding days of the calendar. CalenGoo can do the same, it can sync this list, display your tasks in the calendar views and in a list view and it even makes your tasks available offline. You can edit and add tasks and the changes will be synced with Google Tasks.\n\nYou either need a (free) Google Calendar account to use this app or you can use it with your iOS calendars. However using it with Google Calendar has a few advantages.\n\nTo get more information, screenshots and a tutorial, please go to http://www.calengoo.com\n\nIf you have any problems or suggestions, please send an email to calengoo@dgunia.de or take a look at CalenGoo's support website to get help.\n\nIf you think the font is too small and hard to read, you can increase the font size of all calendar views in the settings under \"Settings\", \"Display and Use\".\n\nFeatures ( http://www.calengoo.com ):\n\n- Drag&drop to quickly copy and move events\n- Templates to quickly create similar events again. They can even be combined, e.g. one template for the location of an event and another for the attendees\n- Print/PDF function to print the day, week, month or agenda view via AirPrint or to email it as a PDF file\n- Supports the same recurrence rules as Google Calendar\n- Supports Google Calendar's event colors when syncing via OAuth2\n- Icons can be assigned to Google Calendar events\n- Date/time can be entered using the iOS wheels or by using a keypad\n- Fast search function\n- Show/edit iOS calendars in addition to Google calendars (or instead of Google calendars)\n- Sync with Google Tasks and iOS Reminders\n- Reminders can be snoozed and they can be (optionally) repeated every minute\n- Birthdays and anniversaries of your contacts can be displayed\n- Zoomable month view, which can be configured to scroll horizontally (month by month) or vertically (week by week)\n- Events can be linked to contacts\n- Floating events and completable events\n- Photos and PDF files can be created and attached to events (via Google Drive)\n- Calendar selection bar to quickly show and hide single calendars\n- The location of an event can be opened with Apple Maps, Google Maps, Navigon, TomTom, Skobbler, Sygic, iGo or Waze\n- View/edit calendars that are shared with others via Google Calendar\n- Many configuration options to change the way the app looks and works"

      "label": "miCal is THE calendar that you’ve always wished your iPhone or iPad had! miCal makes scheduling easier, clearer—and better looking—than ever before.\n\nQuick Overview\nThe dashboard displays your current appointments and events, tasks and birthdays. You can also see the current weather and an overview of the current month at a glance.\n\nIntuitive Controls \nIntuitively navigate through your calendars and quickly, easily add events and tasks thanks to predefined settings and simple controls. Standard settings like repeating events and reminders/alarms are just a tap away. And powerful special settings are also available, without sacrificing comfort or control. Swipe through views and open events or days with just a tap.\n\nmiCal Understands You\nQuickly create events with the new natural language input feature. Natural language input allows you to create events just by describing them. And if you have Siri enabled on your device, you can even dictate your event details instead of typing.\n\nThe Total Package\nmiCal provides complete, well-organized day, week and month views and displays the calendar week in all the important views.\n\nRelax\nYou don’t need to contort yourself with miCal. miCal supports portrait as well as landscape formats in nearly every view.  Use each view however it’s most comfortable for you.\n\nTasks/Reminders\nmiCal now supports iOS reminders. Create reminders for all the important tasks in your private and professional life right in the app.\n\nBirthday Manager\nNever again miss an important birthday. Get reminders at preset times featuring the music of your choice.\n\nNice Weather\nFive-day weather forecasts plus the sunrise/sunset times, humidity and wind speed for the current day. The dashboard even features a quick summary of the current weather as well as a brief forecast of the coming days.\n\nComprehensive\nmiCal offers a unique range of features. Copy, move or send your events. Export your events in the date range of your choice as CSV (for Excel, etc.) or ICS (the calendar format). Set colors for your calendars and individual appointments or automatically add colors based on keywords in event titles.\n\nUp to Date and Secure\nmiCal communicates with your device’s integrated calendar. miCal works with  all the calendar services that your device currently supports (iCloud, Google Calendar, Outlook, Exchange, Facebook Events, subscriptions) without requiring additional configuration. That way, you can store your data locally or via the services you know and trust—it’s up to you. miCal itself does not transmit any data to external services or other servers. That allows us to ensure 100% data security.\n\nAward-Winning\n- 3rd place in the \"Best German iPhone App\" competition at the 2010 iPhone Developer conference.\n- Featured as App of the Week in 13 countries.\n- Recommendation from iPhoneWelt and a 5-star rating from iPhone&Co, two of the leading iPhone magazines\n- Honored at the 2010 App Developer Conference"

      "label": "iPinSafe is the perfect solution if you want to take your secret passwords and PIN codes with you on your iPhone or iPod touch. You can enter and maintain the data either with this app, or with the Mac version of iPinSafe (available on the Mac App Store).\n\nThe app stores the information in a very secure way on your iPhone, and only allows access to someone who can reproduce a specific screen gesture, defined by you.\n\nThe program stores the information with strong encryption, using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). Therefore, the only way to access the data is by entering a key, which only you know. There is no \"backdoor\" to get to the information!\n\niPinSafe uses a unique approach for entering the key. You do not have to type a password or a secret number; instead the program lets you define a gesture, in the form of a line pattern that you simply draw on the screen. This approach has a number of advantages:\n- It is faster than typing a password.\n- Being a line pattern, the key is easier to remember than a series of letters and digits.\n- The number of possible gestures is huge, so it is virtually impossible to guess the correct one.\n\nThe encryption key is not stored on the device - only you know the personal gesture. So even if you lose the device, the information is safe.\n\nWhile you draw your secret line pattern, it appears in a small area of the screen, and can even be totally hidden if you wish. If you suspect that an unauthorized person saw you drawing the line pattern, you can easily change it.\n\nWhile accessing your confidential data, you can lock the data instantly by simply turning the device face-down. This clears the screen, and you must enter the gesture again to see the data.\n\nThe program also locks the data if the device is tilted or moved quickly - for example if someone unexpectedly grabs it from your hands.\n\niPinSafe keeps track of the number of times a wrong gesture has been entered. The app supports auto-destruct: if a wrong gesture has been entered too many times in a row, the stored data is destroyed. You can configure the maximum number of attempts yourself."

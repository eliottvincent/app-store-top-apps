      "label": "Whether you’re working with teammates on a project or planning a weekend activity with loved ones, Microsoft Teams helps bring people together so that they can get things done. It’s the only app that has chats, meetings, files, tasks, and calendars in one place—so you can easily connect with people and bring plans to life. Get family and friends together to manage tasks at home or plan a surprise birthday party. Work with teammates via secure meetings, document collaboration, and built-in cloud storage. You can do it all in Microsoft Teams. \n\nEasily connect with anyone: \n• Meet securely with teammates, family, and friends. Set up a video meeting within seconds and invite anyone by sharing a link or calendar invite. \n• Chat 1-1 or in group chats with friends or colleagues. @mention people in chats to get their attention. \n• Dedicated channels help create a focused workspace for important projects. \n• Video call anyone directly in Teams or instantly convert a group chat to video call. \n• GIFs, emojis, and message animations make it easier to express yourself when words aren’t enough. \n\nAccomplish plans and projects together: \n• Task lists allow you to stay on top of work projects or plans with family and friends. Assign tasks, set due dates, and cross off completed tasks to keep everyone on the same page. \n• File sharing in chats makes it easier to coordinate on work assignments or personal projects.  \n• Cloud storage makes it easy to access shared documents and files on the go.  \n• Dashboard view neatly organizes all shared content—photos, files, tasks, links—so you don’t have to spend time looking for things*. \n• Screenshare, whiteboard, or breakout in virtual rooms to get most out of your work meetings. \n\nDesigned to give you peace of mind: \n• Securely collaborate with external partners for work assignments while maintaining control over your data. \n• Store important information such as subscription passwords in a digital Safe*. \n• Enterprise-level security and compliance you expect from Microsoft 365**. \n\n*Available when using Microsoft Teams with your personal account.  \n**Commercial features of this app require a paid Microsoft 365 commercial subscription or a trial subscription of Microsoft Teams for work.

This gives you an extra layer of security so that you - and only you - can access your applications.\n\nWhen you sign in to Okta, you can use Okta Verify to obtain a temporary 6-digit code or to approve a request notification sent to your device (your organization must enable notifications to use this feature).\n\nOkta values your privacy. Okta Verify does not store personal information - we request permission only for your device camera, which is used to scan a QR code to register your device with Okta.\n\n\nApp Features\n\n* Enroll in Okta Verify as a new user by registering your mobile device with your Okta account.\n* Add one or more Okta accounts that require Okta Verify for authentication.\n* Manage 2-factor authentication for non-Okta applications and web services that require the use of passcodes.\n* Approve or deny sign-in requests on your device from a push notification (if enabled).\n\n\nFor more information, check out our docs at:\nhttps://help.okta.com/en/prod/okta_help_CSH.htm#ext_okta_verify"

Which apps can you use? It depends on what’s been created for you. Here are some examples you might see, or ones you can make yourself using the Power Apps website:\r\n\r\n• Campus app: Map your campus with icons for landmarks and facility details.\r\n• Event registration app: Record attendees as they arrive using barcodes or QR codes.\r\n• Expenses app: Let employees submit their expenses and upload photos of receipts.\r\n• Health clinic app: Let patients check in to appointments with just a few taps.\r\n• NFC reader app: Scan NFC tags on ID cards, equipment, packages, etc.\r\n• Performance app: Visualize data and get insights with interactive dashboards.\r\n• Sales app: See opportunities and leads, review comments, and approve for your P&L.\r\n• Space planning app: Take 3D measurements and manipulate objects in mixed reality.\r\n• Timesheet app: Collect, consolidate, and analyze shift data from employees.\r\n\r\nThis is just a handful of examples; the possibilities are endless. Build and share low-code apps for your work or school at the Power Apps website.\r\n\r\nTIPS\r\n\r\n• Swipe right to make an app a favorite, swipe left to add a shortcut to the home screen.\r\n• As an admin, mark an app as Featured, so that it stays pinned to the top of the apps list.\r\n• Some apps can work offline, and Power Apps will sync your data when you reconnect.\r\n\r\nAccessibility: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2121429"

The app sends you a push notification, and you tap 'Approve' for logins and critical actions when it's you, or 'Deny' if it's not. For even more convenience, Salesforce Authenticator can use location services to automatically verify from locations you trust, like your office or home. Better yet, Einstein can save trusted requests for you! Then you need only respond to notifications when something out-of-the-ordinary happens.\n\nYou can also get a verification code when you need one. The codes also work as a backup authentication method if you're on a plane, or have poor connectivity. This means Salesforce Authenticator also works with third-party services that use OATH TOTP tokens. \nhttp://twofactorauth.org.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. Rest assured, we go to great lengths to ensure minimal GPS use so that Salesforce Authenticator does not significantly impact your battery life."

Whova is one of the most widely used mobile apps by professionals for networking at conferences, trade shows, expos, summits, conventions, business meetings, corporate events, association events, and community gatherings. Whova, the Mobile Event App, has received the Event Technology Awards for five years in a row (2016-2021). \n\nWatch this PREVIEW VIDEO to see how Whova can help you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IKTYK8ZS9g\n\nWhat makes Whova special? Whova's technology builds comprehensive profiles of attendees so you can view all attendee profiles before you even arrive at the event or conference. Plan in advance whom to meet at an event, what to talk about with each attendee and reach out to others via in-app messages before, during and after the event. You can also create casual meetups and arrange social activities with other groups of attendees. Whova revolutionizes event networking and significantly improves the ROI of attending events.\n\nYou can also use the Whova conference app to digitize and manage business cards you receive at events. Whova exceeds other business card reader apps like CamCard, CardMunch, ScanBizCards or Scannable etc. by automatically building full profiles using Whova's SmartProfile technology. This allows you to gain deep insights into your contacts' professional backgrounds, work experience, passions, and interests. You can also seamlessly connect with contacts online via LinkedIn and other platforms. Whova's business card scanning feature now supports cards in English, Chinese, and Korean.\n\nWhova is SOC2 Type II and PCI compliant. These security and privacy certificates recognize Whova’s practice of reliable, safe, secure, and trustworthy management of user data protection and privacy.\n\nGet more out of events:\n\n- Never miss important updates: Get instant notifications from event organizers\n\n- Browse comprehensive professional profiles of all event attendees\n\n- Use the Community Board to self-organize social activities and gatherings, coordinate rideshares, break the ice, explore job opportunities, post questions and lost & found items, etc.\n\n- Scan and save business cards and gain deep insights into your contacts\n\n- Send in-app messages and schedule private meetings before and after events\n\n- Access the agenda, GPS guidance, interactive floor maps, parking directions, slides, and photos\n\n- Get involved in event activities through live polling, event gamification, Tweeting, photo sharing, group chatting, and mobile surveys\n\n- Conveniently explore exhibitors' information and get coupons/giveaways with one tap\n\nTestimonials:\n\n- “It makes networking much more effective at this event with 500+ attendees. We no longer have to wander around wondering if we will bump into the person we really would like to meet. “\n\n- “I could see who attended and easily follow up with the people after this entrepreneur/investor event”\n\n- “I have seen other event apps but neither of them provided such valuable information of the attendees. “\n\n- “This app has been fantastic for networking, announcements, agenda, etc., at this one-week conference!”\n\n- “Another great feature of the Whova app is the ability to share slides and documents electronically.”\n\n- \"Whova is an amazing app for keeping track of your connections and storing them in one easy-to-access place. I love the ability to connect with contacts via LinkedIn and the simplicity of emailing potential members.\"\n\nGet in touch:\n\nTo partner with Whova or simply to stay up-to-date with the latest news, please visit our website and follow us on Twitter:\nhttp://twitter.com/whovasupport\n\nWe would love to hear your feedback!\nContact us at: support@whova.com\n\nAcknowledgements: Icons by Icons8"

Here’s how it works: \n\nGeolocation \nUse the app to create a geofence—a virtual boundary—around your workplace. Then, when your employees enter or leave the geofence, Blip picks up their location and asks them to clock in or out, helping you to know exactly where your staff have worked and how long for. \n\nQR codes \nAlternatively, you can use Blip’s smart scanning system to record your employees’ work hours instead. \nYour staff use Blip to scan a QR code—a type of barcode—when they arrive and leave work. Then, each time they scan the code, Blip will register them as clocked in or out. It’s that simple. \n\nBreaks\nBlip makes it easy to track breaks, too. At the tap of a button, your staff can log the start and end of their breaks, so you can see how long and how often they take downtime.  \n\nHow Blip helps you:\n    -    Check your employees’ work hours and track their location in an instant. \n    -    Keep an eye on your employees’ breaks and make sure they’re getting enough downtime. \n    -    Change an incorrect shift or break time in a few quick taps.\n    -    Create multiple locations and easily track where your employees have worked.\n    -    View a full history of an employee’s work hours and filter the date range easily.\n    -    Export the work history for an individual or team and save it as a spreadsheet for your records."

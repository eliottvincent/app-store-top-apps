Show your skills as a hotel manager, invest wisely in staff and property improvements, and work your socks off to become a hospitality tycoon in this addictive and entertaining casual simulator.\n\n► FIRST-CLASS SERVICE\n\n• Climb to the top: Start the game as a simple bellhop single-handedly cleaning rooms, greeting guests at reception, collecting payments and tips, and keeping the bathroom stocked with toilet paper. As your bank balance expands, upgrade rooms and facilities, and employ new staff to help keep up with the growing demand at your hotel. Your guests may be sleeping comfortably, but there’s no time to rest for a determined hotel tycoon.\n\n• Build an empire: There are several hotels to explore and expand, each with dozens of different unique upgrades to make before you reach five-star perfection.

Each hotel has its own style and atmosphere too.\n\n• Keep going: If you want success in this high-stakes industry, you can’t just stroll around your property at a leisurely pace.

      "label": "Stack Ball is a 3D arcade game where players smash, bump and bounce through revolving helix platforms to reach the end. Sound easy? You wish!\n\nYour ball smashes like a brick through colorful platforms that block its descent, but if you hit a black one, it's all over! Your ball shatters to pieces and you have to start your fall all over again.\n\nBut even black platforms are no match for a fireball falling at full speed! Choose your strategy: speed up like a madman or stop and wait for your next chance to roll and jump. Other ball games wish they were this fun!\n\nWhy Stack Ball rules:\n\n- Crazy fast speed\n- Fun gameplay\n- Bright vibrant graphics\n- Simple and easy to play\n- Great time killer"

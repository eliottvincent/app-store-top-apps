Now edited by Maxine Frith, The Lady was first launched in 1885 and is now published monthly, notorious over the years for its much loved classified advertisement section.\n \nIndependently run, The Lady was founded by Thomas Gibson Bowles, maternal grandfather of the Mitford sisters, who started The Lady upon his wife’s suggestion that a women’s magazine would prove popular. Since then, The Lady has remained within the same family and is now under the management of publisher, Ben Budworth.\n\nThe iPad/iPhone edition brings you selected pages from the latest issue as soon as it is available. You can subscribe within the application for full access, which brings you every page of the issue and a searchable archive back to 27th April 2010. Issues are not sold individually - for the duration of your subscription you have access to every issue in this archive.\n\nDuring your subscription you can sync back issues to your device. These will remain in place if your subscription expires, unless your device removes them (for example when running low on disk space). Re-downloading issues requires a current subscription.\n\n• Swipe or tap the page edges to flip to next/previous page.\n• Use the animated thumbnail view to flick through the pages.\n• Pinch or double-tap pages to zoom.\n• Switch between single or double-page view.\n• Search the current issue or the archive.\n• Tap any page links to web sites, email addresses, phone numbers or maps.\n• Tap contents-page links to jump to a particular article.\n• Sync back issues to your device for offline reading (requires wi-fi).\n• Network connection required otherwise.\n                                                                      \nWe recommend first running the app within a wi-fi area so it can sync the latest issue to your device - after that you can use it anywhere. Subscribers will receive new issues automatically.\n\nSubscriptions are available within the app at the following prices:\n\nWeekly Sub £1.49\nAnnual Sub £54.99\n\nIn addition, please note the following standard features of auto-renewable iTunes subscriptions:\n\n• Your payment will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\n• Subscriptions will renew automatically unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.\n• Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.\n• You can manage your subscriptions and turn off auto-renewal by going to your Account Settings in iTunes after purchase.\n• No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during active subscription period.\n\nYou can find our privacy policy here:\n\nhttps://www.exacteditions.com/about/privacy\n\nand our terms of service here:\n\nhttps://www.exacteditions.com/about/tos"

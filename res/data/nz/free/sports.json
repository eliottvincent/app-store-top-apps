The system also includes an A.I. powered GPS rangefinder and caddie advice for any hole on earth to help golfers of all skill levels make smarter decisions, improve faster and shoot lower scores.\n\nIn 2020, new Arccos Caddie members improved their handicap by a remarkable 5.02 strokes! \n\nThe winner of five-straight Golf Digest Editors’ Choice Awards (2016-2020), Arccos Caddie now features Strokes Gained Analytics (SGA). Providing players with the most advanced personalized insights in the game, SGA is the first platform to allow a player to select any target handicap – from Tour player to 20 – and measure their performance versus that goal across every game facet. SGA not only supports deep dives for all performance segments by each round or customizable periods, it automatically highlights a player’s top-3 strengths and weaknesses and provides tips from world-class instructors. \n\nFor golfers who prefer to prefer to play without having to carry a smartphone, Arccos Caddie Link is a perfect solution. This small, ultralight wearable allows Arccos players to capture their shot data without having to carry a smartphone on the course. Link seamlessly pairs with the Arccos Caddie app and sensors. Worn on a player’s belt, waistband or pocket, it tracks shots in real time – including the club used and precise location – and automatically transfers the data to a player’s smartphone via Bluetooth, either during or after the round. This allows golfers to play the game their way, freeing them to keep their phone in a cart, bag, back pocket or elsewhere.\n\n\nThe ideal way for players, coaches and clubfitters to dial improve decision-making, inform practice regimens and dial-in equipment choices, key Arccos Caddie features include:\n   - Automatic Shot Tracking\n   - Smart Distance Club Averages\n   - A.I. Powered GPS Rangefinder\n   - A.I. Caddie Advice (developed in partnership with Microsoft)\n   - Strokes Gained Analytics \n\nThe Arccos Caddie app works with Arccos Caddie Smart Sensors, and Arccos Caddie Smart Grips as well as a wide range of PING and Cobra golf clubs that come standard with Arccos Caddie sensors embedded in the grip (PING G710 and G425 clubs, and every club in the KING Cobra line). Arccos also has official partnerships with TaylorMade Golf, Club Champion, TXG and Cool Clubs.\n\n\nThe world’s most-used on-course golf app, Arccos Caddie has hundreds of thousands of registered users who have played millions of rounds and taken hundreds of millions of shots. Arccos Caddie also offers a tournament mode that Conforms to the Rules of Golf (USGA Decision #2017-0754).\n\n\n\nThe Arccos Caddie app uses the iPhone's GPS at the highest level of accuracy which can have an impact on battery usage.\n\nThe Arccos Caddie app supports Apple Watch and uses HealthKit to create a golf workout while you are playing golf.\n\nArccos End User License Agreement: https://www.arccosgolf.com/pages/end-user-license-agreement"

      "label": "Biblia Română (Romanian Holy Bible)\nCornilescu (1921)\nDumitru Cornilescu (n. 4 aprilie 1891, comuna Slașoma, județul Mehedinți - d. 1975, Elveția) a fost ierodiacon și autor al unei traduceri în limba română a Bibliei, publicată în 1921, traducere care este în prezent cea mai răspândită traducere în rândul confesiunilor protestante (inclusiv cele neoprotestante).\nBiblia (din lb. greacă βιβλίον, pl. βιβλία -cărți) se referă la scripturile sacre din iudaism și creștinism. Aceste scripturi sunt compilații ale unor documente separate (numite „cărți”) scrise într-un interval de timp de circa 1000 de ani. Numai Vechiul Testament are circa 100-150 scriitori diferiți, provenind din intelectualitatea aflată în serviciul conducătorilor politici. Cărțile sale au fost publicate separat și adunate în secolele I-II e.n. pentru a forma prima Biblie ebraică, Tanach, iar mai târziu, cu adăugiri, Biblia creștină, numită de creștini și Sfânta Scriptură.\nPrima parte a Bibliei creștine este numită Vechiul Testament (din grecescul \"palaia diathékè\"). Vechiul Testament reprezintă în mare traducerea grecească (sau din aceasta în alte limbi) a textului sacru ebraic așa cum era el prin secol II î.e.n. O împărțire cu origine evreiască pe criterii funcționale a Vechiului Testament îl împarte pe acesta în Legea (\"Legea lui Moise\", \"Pentateucul\", adică primele \"cinci cărți\" ale Bibliei), Profeții și Scrierile Sfinte. A doua parte a Bibliei creștine este numită Noul Testament.\nPrima traducere integrală a Bibliei în limba română a fost tipărită în 1688. Biblia a cunoscut mai multe traduceri în limba română. Denominațiile neoprotestante folosesc traducerea Bibliei în limba română de Dumitru Cornilescu, cu sau fără explicații. De remarcat că traducerea Cornilescu a fost inițial acceptată de Biserica Ortodoxă, prima traducere a lui Dumitru Cornilescu a apărut cu binecuvântarea patriarhului României, fiind ulterior respinsă de Biserica Ortodoxă (după ce preotul Dumitru Cornilescu a început să dea învățături specifice cultelor evanghelice cum ar fi îndreptățirea prin credință), dar folosită de Oastea Domnului și de confesiunile neoprotestante. Criticii din vremea publicării ei au considerat-o „net superioară oricărei alte traduceri, fiind prezentată într-o limbă suplă și curgătoare, care lipsește oricărei alte traduceri; fiind expusă într-o limbă care vorbește înseși inimilor oamenilor”. Biserica Ortodoxă Română a generat, la rândul ei, mai multe traduceri de-a lungul timpului, fie integrale fie parțiale, a Sfintei Scripturi, e.g., Biblia „Carol al II-lea”, Palia de la Orăștie, „Biblia pe versuri tocmită”."

      "label": "Unlike other techniques, you do not need to \"reprogram\" your brain with various Schulte tables, memory training, vocabulary development, memorizing numbers, etc. Reading speed increases due to the lack of eye movement and focusing of vision in one place. You will see how much you are absorbed in the content of the text, when you realize all the advantages of not having to move your eyes while reading in unnatural directions.\n\nThe speed reading technique, in our book reader Bookva, will help increase the speed reading technique from the standard 250 words per minute, the average person, to 600-700 words per minute, and even more.\n\nReading in Bookva should not create discomfort; if so, then you are using this technology incorrectly. Don't rush to speed up. You will understand when you need to read faster - when you feel that the current speed has become too slow for you.

Not only can you track all of the books that you own, as well as how far you've read, but you can also keep a wishlist of the books that you'd like to pick up in the future. Whether a book is in your 'Library' or your 'Wishlist,' Book Track displays information and gorgeous cover art for all of them. While Book Track uses information from the internet, more obscure books can also be added manually, too.\n\nBook Track is a free app and is limited to 5 books. A single in-app purchase unlocks support for unlimited books across iPhone and iPad. A separate purchase is required to unlock the full Mac app.\n\nBook Track users can look forward to:\n\n- A synchronized list of books and information — whether you save a book on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac, it'll be synced across all devices. Both your Library and Wishlist will be synced seamlessly and automatically so you'll never lose a book again — or buy the same book twice because you forgot you already own it!\n\n- Easy and comprehensive book organization — Every book you add to your Library can be marked as read, reading, or unread, with each book also supporting tags to help you find similar books throughout your collection. Book information like title, author, description, publisher, year of publication, genre, and even the description can also be edited to make your Library as accurate or personal as possible.\n\n- Quote saving — Find a passage within a book that you want to save for later? Book Track can save your favorite quotes in one place so you can read them again later. You can even put them on your Home screen using a widget.\n\n- All the stats, right where you'll see them — Book Track collects library and reading statistics and puts them right on your Home screen with gorgeous widgets. iPad users can enjoy an extra large widget with even more stats, too!\n\n- Support for importing books from services like Goodreads, BookBuddy, Reading List, and more — It's never been easier to import your books from other apps and services so you don't have to start building your library all over again. Book collections can also be exported to PDF and CSV as well.\n\n- Deep integration with iOS and macOS — Book Track includes support for the latest Apple features including Shortcuts and Siri, while Widgets can be used to put your favorite quotes right onto your Home screen.\n\n- Privacy — Book Track doesn't collect any of your personal data and doesn't track you in any way. Books should be fun, not another reason to worry about your data privacy."

It was nominated for the best iOS accessible app in 2020 and 2017 on AppleVis, the leading authority in the field of accessibility on Apple devices.\n\nBy moving your reading activities to commuting, walking, running, doing the housework or another activity you can save an hour each day.

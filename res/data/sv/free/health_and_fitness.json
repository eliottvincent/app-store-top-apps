If you have doubts or if the line is not very clear, you can take a photo of your test and edit it by modifying the contrast, grayscale, contrast, brightness, gamma, saturation, etc. in order to see it more clearly.\n- Photo editing: You will be able to take a photo of your test once you take a physical test, edit it, retouch it, add effects, and then share it with your loved ones so they know that you are pregnant and expecting a baby.\n\nNote: This app has been created with the purpose of help and guidance, but it does not offer scientific results or reliable results. It is a quiz for obtaining a guiding result as an aid but is never definitive. It is important that you go to the doctor or pharmacy for a 100% reliable result."

Workouts are categorized into boxing, kickboxing, Muay Thai, and K1. They are also suitable for practitioners of MMA, Jiu-Jitsu, Karate, Taekwondo or any other types of martial arts.\n\nWhile a heavy bag is helpful, it’s not absolutely necessary to be able to train hard with the app. You can use the app to do shadowboxing at home, then already know the combos you want to master on a boxing bag or during sparring when you hit the gym.\nTip: For a sweaty, challenging kickboxing training and great cardio, try shadowboxing with weights in your hands!\n\nFeatures of Heavy Bag Pro include:\n* Guided, ready-to-go workouts – just warm up and press “Start”\n* Custom workouts – create workouts from any combos or techniques you want to focus on\n* Learning corner – master single punches or kicks and combos to add to your arsenal\n* Boxing timer – keep up the intensity while training on your own \n\nNew workouts and combos are added constantly, so you’ll never get bored.\n\nIs the app free?\n\nThere are two versions: free and premium. With the free version, you get three full workouts (one in every discipline) and an interval round timer (without ads). If you want to unlock all the workouts and other features and exercises, you’ll need to upgrade to premium. A monthly subscription costs less than a one-time visit to most gyms.\n\nIf you’re serious about getting a leg up on your competition, you need this boxing app. Not only does it up your motivation with fun, guided punching bag home workouts, but it helps you master the combos that will outsmart your competition.\n\nAll you need is your phone and the willpower to win! \n\nTerms and Conditions: https://heavybag.pro/app-terms/\nPrivacy Policy: https://heavybag.pro/app-privacy-policy/"

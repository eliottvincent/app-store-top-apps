It has a local browser inside de device, but it also provides a remote connection to Midori, which has a lightweight webkit rendering engine that lends the same supremacy in speed that has spurred the growth of Google Chrome. It supports HTML 5 + CSS 3, and is based in Webkit. \n\nCroPlus gives you the power to take back control of your Web experience. That’s why we design CroPlus with the most secure and anonymous functionalities. Its main local features  are similar to our XFirePlus app, which are:\n\n- Local browser for quick navigation.\n- Search intelligence. \n- Bookmark management.\n- Caching to optimize the web browsing. \n- Visual Tabs to find content for future reference.\n- Open as many tabs as you like without losing track of your open Web pages.\n- Access to a Firefox running in a remote machine. Your Ip address will never be tracked.\n\nBut be aware that CroPlus includes a remote connection to a Cloud system from which you will be able to run a Midori web browser. As such, it inherits all the Midori functionalities. It supports many of the most popular parts of the web, including Google, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Spotify and Rdio."

You can then tap to view street view, share or get directions (via Apple Maps or iMaps+).\n\nAlternatively, drag the yellow peg man from the top left hand corner of the map and release over a road or path to access street view.\n\nStreet view supports zooming in and out, and showing a mini-map overlay. There is also a full screen mode for a more immersive experience.\n\nIf you need a more complete Google Maps experience, look for \"iMaps+ for Google Maps\" on the App Store. iMaps+ provides all the great functionality from iStreets with the addition of directions, traffic, contacts integration and more.\n\n\nNotes:\n\nSubscriptions: iStreets operates as a subscription service. Recurring purchase is required for full functionality. Payment will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period. Subscriptions may be managed, and auto-renewal may be turned off, from iStreets settings or the Apple Settings app. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited if you change your subscription term.\n\nDirections, street view and live traffic details are only available in certain geographical regions.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nTerms of Service: http://apptility.co.uk/imaps_tos.html\n\nApptility Limited is not related to, or affiliated with, Google, Inc.

      "label": "Measure distance, perimeter and area on a map. Add stand alone points to understand better what is where on a map. Capture photos stamped with location, direction, altitude and time. Share and export your projects.\n\nPlanimeter app will be useful for measuring construction sites, roofs, lawns, fences, paving, pools, parking lots, fields and paths. Or even for just putting stand alone points on a map.\n\nWhere this planimeter app stands out?\n\n- Precise control of the planned/measured area. As you move a map, the app will show you what area/distance is going to be and what would be the size of adjacent lines. Even before you add a new point.\n\n- Native Google maps support adds extra zoom-in ability for satellite and hybrid maps.\n\n- Every point can have its own color and have text, audio and image attached.\n\n- You can move point directly on a main map screen (tap on a point and pick Move option) or in the dedicated point editor screen. Again, before you confirm the move you know perfectly what the resulting area/perimeter/distance will be.\n\n- You can hide/show shapes and point collections. This way you can focus only on what is important for the current project.\n\n- Flexible units of measurement allow you to configure when display of feet or meters changes to miles and kilometers. Same for area units.\n\n- Custom url, offline and import maps. Apple maps and Google maps are built into the app. And then, you can add other maps. The app supports adding custom url maps, downloading offline maps or importing maps (mbtiles, sqlitedb) that you might have crafted on your PC or Mac.\n\n- Kmz export and import option allows to transfer shapes and point collections in their entirety, including images and audio notes. This allows you to continue working on your project on different devices.\n\nBasic version allows you to create unlimited number of points and temporary measurement shapes (areas or routes), so you can measure with no limits. To add a new shape to measure, you just discard the previous one.\n\nPro pack upgrade adds:\n\n- Google and custom url, offline, imported maps support. Google maps adds extra zoom ability for satellite and hybrid maps.\n- Ability to save multiple point collections/shapes.\n- Import and export for a single point and whole shapes/collections.\n- Saving and sharing a map snapshot, the one that shows only the objects that you created on a map - buttons and tools removed.\n\nPro Pack upgrade is a one off upgrade, no subscription or recurring charges are involved.\n\nUse MENU (hamburger) button > DOCUMENTATION or SUPPORT  AND FEEDBACK options to get help. Just in case, support email is stan@blocoware.com. All emails are answered within hours or up to 9 hours if they come during CET/EU night time.\n\nWishing your happy measuring!\nPlanimeter 55 team."

      "label": "Turn your iPhone and iPad into a Speedometer with Speedometer One! Speedometer One is also suitable for cars, boats, motorcycles, or other types of vehicles. We have various features to make Speedometer the best speed tracker app for IOS devices. We use GPS to track your speed and alert you when you are over the speed limit. There are other features that will be useful for you such as Night Mode, HUD screen, and many more.  \n\nHave you ever driven a car and worried that you go over the speed limit? Driving too fast can get you into trouble especially if there are some traffic cops nearby with their speed radar gun. That’s why we add Speed Limit Alert as one of the most important features of our app. You can enable and disable it. We support US and EU style speed limit signs and support different display units. This means that it will make it easier to drive when you visit EU or USA. \n\nAside from tracking your speed, Speedometer one also can track your distance, altitude, average speed, and top speed. \n\n=== FEATURES OF SPEEDOMETER ONE: ===\n\n\t•\tAccurate Speedometer for Cars, Boats, Motorcycle or other types of Vehicles. \n\t•\tChoose your units mph, km/h, or knots. \n\t•\tSupport Night Mode with high contrast on the screen. \n\t•\tSupport Landscape or Portrait Mode.\n\t•\tSpeed Limit Alert: Enable this option first, and \n\t•\tHUD (Head Unit Display) Mode \n\t•\tSupports USA and EU speed limit. \n\t•\tChoose over 44 themes (22 dark and 22 light) through In-App Purchase. \n\nWhen you use the HUD mode, you can put your iPhone on the dashboard near the windshield. Our app is very customizable, especially if you’ve unlocked our themes. You can choose the look and display according to your needs: your mood, eyesight, night or day. Our customization is what sets us apart from other similar apps. Try it for yourself today!\n\nIMPORTANT USAGE NOTE: \n\n\t•\tTo be able to use Speedometer One, please allow Location Services.  \n\t•\tSet what kind of vehicle you use and the max speed before using. \n\t•\tSpeedometer One is not compatible with Wifi only iPad or iPod Touch. \n\t•\tOur speed tracker is based on GPS info. GPS sensor is not always accurate due to the device hardware sensor limitation. When in doubt, always rely on your car’s speedometer.\n\t•\tGPS is most accurate when you are in wide-open spaces. Trees, tall buildings, and other things might affect your GPS accuracy. \n\t•\tProlong use of GPS will affect your battery life. \n\t•\tPlease stay safe. Focus on the road ahead and do not interact with any device when you are driving, especially when you are driving at high speed.\n\nLove Speedometer One!

The app is ideal during trips, sports, treasure hunting (geocaching), solo travel and any other activities out in the world that require location data.\r\n\r\nIn the basic view you will see following data:\r\n- latitude and longitude in formats:\r\n- decimal degrees\r\n    - degrees, decimal minutes\r\n    - degrees, minutes, seconds\r\n    - UTM\r\n- altitude\r\n- GPS accuracy\r\n- speed (km/h, m/s, mph)\r\n- direction\r\n- location address (if available)\r\n\r\nIn addition, on the main view screen, you can save your exact location and take a photo and our application will plot any data you wish on it.\r\n\r\nIn the map view, you can see your current position and saved locations as well as add new places. Thanks to this function, you can easily find beautiful beaches from last summer, hidden treasures, favorite restaurants or even a place to park your car. To add a new place, just press and hold a button and then enter the name. You can switch to four different map types - normal, terrain, hybrid, satellite. In this view, a coordinates finder is available based on your current address - all you need to do is enter the address and the application will determine the location data, such as latitude and longitude or vice versa.\r\n\r\nOn the history screen you will see all of your saved places. A chronological sorting is also available, in alphabetical order, based on distance from your current location. The application displays the name of the place, save date, latitude and longitude, distance from current position based on WGS84, direction and saved photos. An interesting feature is the possibility of transferring a given place to another person using our application and the import / export function. \r\n\r\nIn addition, the app makes it possible to provide an up-to-date GPS location with a link to Google Maps via text message, email, FB messenger, and other available options. This is especially useful in dangerous situations where you have no access to data transmission.\r\n\nTerms and conditions:  https://mysticmobileapps.com/legal/terms/mygpslocation\nPrivacy policy: https://mysticmobileapps.com/legal/privacy/mygpslocation"

Whether you want a scenic, winding route or the fastest way from A to B, voice commands and the clear TFT display with arrows providing directions will guide you and your motorbike safely to your destination.

We recommend using the BMW Motorrad communication system for listening to music, making telephone calls and receiving navigation instructions.\r\n•\tA mobile Internet connection is required to access traffic information. This may incur costs in line with the contract between the customer and their mobile provider (e.g. for roaming).\r\n•\tPlease note that the functionality of your smartphone and the connection to the vehicle also depend on national requirements and factors; BMW Motorrad therefore cannot guarantee that it will be available at all times.\r\n•\tThe BMW Motorrad Connected app will be displayed in the language you have set for your smartphone. Please note that not all languages are supported.\r\n•\tContinued use of GPS tracking in the background may reduce the battery life of your smartphone.\r\nMake Life a Ride."

You can see the movement of hunting dogs and other hunters on your smartphone, share information between hunters and create your own hunting map.\n\nTracking a common hunt is easy\nOne of the members of the hunt starts hunting on his or her phone and receives a unique code. Other hunters join the hunt using this code. This creates a hunting team whose movement is visible on the phone map. When the owner of a hunting dog with a Huntloc tracking device joins the hunt, all participants will also be able to see the dog's location. \nHunting with Huntloc is more effective, safer and more fun\n•\tWhile on a common hunt, your phone shows the current location of dogs and hunters, the direction of movement, the pace of movement, and the distance traveled. Hunting and dog tracking are unlimited in distance.\n•\tDuring the hunt, you can send messages to the participants and share the location of the various hunting events on the map (e.g., a caught game, an animal track, etc.). Plus, you can quickly call any hunter.\n•\tThe different maps of Google and the Estonian Land Board and the hunting objects recorded by the hunter themselves (e.g., animal feeding places and other hunting-related locations and areas) give an accurate overview of the hunting ground. You can share your hunting objects with other Huntloc users. \n•\tWhen navigating in the hunt, you can set a navigation target and then use the compass view to arrive at the desired location by the shortest route.\n•\tA 24-hour weather forecast with sunrise and sunset time will help you plan your hunt. You can view the weather forecast for your own location or for a location selected on the map.\n•\tHuntloc's portal.huntloc.com can be used for viewing the hunts you have participated in and for more convenient drawing of the hunting card.\n\nThe location of a dog with the Huntloc tracking device can be seen on your smartphone\nThe Huntloc tracking device provides a very accurate position of the dog in the terrain. The tracking device uses the mobile network and has no distance limitation - the dog can be tracked from thousands of kilometers away. All you need is a smartphone to monitor your dog and control your device. In addition to tracking, you can call the dog, listen to the dog's activities and give voice commands. Keeping the device constantly on the dog's neck, it acts as a security device and can be switched on from a distance when the dog is lost. \n\nThe tracking device is very strong, lightweight, waterproof and has a long service life. The monitoring time is 36 hours (10 seconds interval) and the standby time is 1 month. In order to ensure waterproofing, there are no openings or buttons on the unit, and the 3 indicator lights indicate the unit's operating status. The device is charged wirelessly."

When you go over a preset speed limit, the large digits change colour from green to red and the device emits a loud sound to alert you! Great for avoiding speeding tickets!\n\n‣ Easy to set and configurable speed limits \nSet speed limits with 4 fast and configurable presets. Presets only need a single tap and are the safest way to set the limits! \n\n‣ S.O.S. Flat tyre or worse? \nOur speedometer shows your current location and you can share it easily (sms/text, email) with car assistance services, ambulance or friends. \n\n‣ Know your car's limits ! \nDoes your car become sluggish on those steep climbs? Is it possible you got too high in mountains ? Our built-in altimeter will provide you with accurate readings that indicate your height over sea-level. \n\n‣ In a dispute for speeding?\nGPS Black box gives you point by point time, speed, location and altitude data for the last 20 minutes of your travel. You can email its data as an excel or csv file. Or you can surely switch it off or reset at any moment.\n\n‣ Need to know where you are?\nIntegrated map shows your location and a tracking \"tail\" behind you.\n\n∙∙ UNIVERSAL APP. Speedometer for iPhone and 3G-iPads. Retina graphics included. \n\n∙∙ 000-999 SPEED AND LIMIT RANGE. MPH, KMH AND KNOTS. Maximum, average speed, distance traveled. \n\n! You can use this app on your iPhone 3GS, 4, or 4S as well as on any iPad with 3G. **App will not work properly on iPods and wifi only iPads as they don't have GPS chip (External GPS module is required).\n! Please note that as with all GPS apps, continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. \n\nDrive safely and avoid paying those speeding fines! Our speedometer is the ideal watchdog companion no matter what journey you are going on!\n\nFull version of the speedometer gives you ability to work in background, GPS tracking, waypoints, trip cost computer, Siri shortcuts for applying speed limits and controlling track recording, 100+ customization options and more. Be sure to check it out in the AppStore!\n\n* A bit of instructions: If speedometer doesn't show you the speed, just be sure to be under the open sky to have GPS signal. Under the open sky, within 5-10 seconds GPS indicator will become green and speedometer will start showing the speed.\n** If you wonder why gps speedometer may show 3-5 mph (3-8 kmh) less than a car's speedometer, you can take a look here: http://goo.gl/wtLvT (tomtom's discussion thread).\n*** And here is an amazing article http://goo.gl/p5zfMi explaining why GPS might show you 80ft (or -80!) altitude when you are laying on the beach. Don't throw the app or iPhone away just because of that! :) Let us use the article's last sentence here: \"Those who use GPS altitude to aid in landing their small plane should have their insurance policies paid up at all times\"."

Safedriver allows parents to monitor their children behavior behind the wheel. Safedriver also reduce the use of Smartphones and control the speed while they are driving. Our app is an innovative solution to reduce car accidents among teenagers rewarding them if they drive safely.\n \nSafeDriver  “The App that saves lives”\n\nManipulating the smartphone, having a social media conversation, post, talking, surfing the web, etc. while driving could be the last thing a person would do. Smartphone distractions while driving increase 24 times the risk of a car accident. Our engineers at Webtrack, understand that responsible behavior is the key to developing safe driving habits, whether you are a teen, a parent, an educator, or a community member.\n\nWe found that most parents have rules and restrictions for their teen driver, however only a small proportion had formalized these rules via a parent-teen driving agreement. Parents reported worrying more about their teen driver’s safety during the learner permit phase, when crash risk is very low compared with crash risk when the teen begins to drive independently. Parental awareness of teen drivers’ safety after licensure and the understanding of the importance of parental rules and restrictions for shaping teen driving behavior could be improved. Interventions that directly engage parents and provide concrete tools such as a parent-teen driving agreement have been reported to reduce risky driving among teens\nSafeDriver is a mobile app installed in the driver’s Smartphone, it automatically is activated during a trip, setting the behavior rules to reduce the risk of an accident.\n\nSafeDriver is location and monitoring application linked to the driver’s vehicle through an electronic Bluetooth Low Energy accessory developed by Webtrack, any other HF Bluetooth protocol or even a built in Bluetooth accessory that comes from the car company factory.\n\n*Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

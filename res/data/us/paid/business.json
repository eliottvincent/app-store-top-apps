Performers, photographers, website operators and others involved in the production of such material must generate legal records containing specific categories of information under Title 18 U.S.C. §§ 2257 & 2257A (“Section 2257”). A copy of the performer’s picture ID card must also be included in the records. Some online platforms also require a written record of consent by the performer to be depicted on a specific website or account.\n\nQuick 2257® allows you to:\n\n• Create a form containing the performer’s legal name, stage names, and/or aliases;\n• Record the date of original production of the depiction;\n• Identify the title of the work associated with the depiction;\n• Capture the performer’s picture ID card and verification photo on the mobile device; \n• Sign and verify the accuracy of the information using the touch screen;\n\n• Create a written, signed consent form authorizing publication of the depiction;\n\n• Compile all information into convenient .pdf forms; and,\n• Store the records on the device or email them to the records custodian.\n\nDeveloped by Lawrence G. Walters, Esq., First Amendment attorney and inventor of other technology designed for the online entertainment industry, this app streamlines the process of generating and transmitting Section 2257 records and consent forms. Anyone involved in the production of erotic material can now quickly compile, store, and transmit the mandatory performer records using this simple mobile app."

Using AES encryption, you can rest easy knowing your data is safe and secure.\n\n• Import, Export, Share: It’s easy to import your data from existing files, so getting started is a breeze. Import your data from text, CSV, Bento and more.

      "label": "The Liberty Item Entry App is designed to allow users of Resaleworld's popular Liberty software to enter and update inventory while on the go. Accounts can be added and updated as well. This app allows store employees to move to wherever they need to be with the convenience of a mobile device, while still having the ability access and enter information.This app helps improve productivity and helps to overcome a number of logistical challenges. The Item Entry App is ideal for the following scenarios: adding photographs to large amounts of new or existing inventory; adding large furniture which is difficult to relocate to a PC with a full installation of Liberty software; traveling to estate sales to add inventory; adding and updating inventory stored in a warehouse.\n\nThe item entry interface includes several design features that are optimized for a touch-screen, smaller display for popular mobile devices. A list of the 20 most commonly used categories speeds up item entry considerably. A graphical trend analysis tool calculates and displays pricing information based on the category and brand of the item being entered, based on the past year's sales data. Adding photographs to items is simple and quick both when using images from the device's photo library or when taking new pictures with the device's camera.  This app also allows users to print tags for inventory, to email item lists directly to accountholders, and to view an account's transaction history.\n\nThis app requires an installation Liberty Software (Liberty REACT, Liberty 5, Liberty 4 Consignment, or Liberty 4 Trading Assistants) and either a qualifying Web Service plan or a stand-alone Liberty Mobile Access license. Please contact Resaleworld with any questions about Liberty Mobile Access eligibility."

For example : If there is a PDF file of size 15 MB, the application could compress it to a size of 5 MB. \nThe application is also very useful for compressing PDF files with scanned pages, graphics and photos. Compressed PDF documents require less disk space for storage and facilitate faster uploads and downloads which saves transmission time, internet data and cost. This application gives you access to many compression options to help you to reduce PDF file size without compromising the document's quality.\n\nKey Features:\n\n-> Email PDFs easily\nCompress the PDF file before you email it. In this way, the email will not only be delivered faster but also will be be quicker to open at the receiver's end. The email providers have a file size limit of 20MB, so compressing PDFs will also help to keep the attachment size within limits.\n\n-> Download and upload the PDF files easily\nCompress and use a smaller version of the PDF files with good quality. In this way, the PDF files will load more quickly on your website and it will also download quickly on the visitor's devices.\n\n-> Great Quality of PDF\nCompress your PDF files using multiple compression options to get a combination of prefect quality and file size which is great for uploading files to the web, sharing with the other applications and sending it through email on mobile phones.\n\n-> Compress even more by changing the PDF contents to Grayscale :\nThe PDF could also be converted to Grayscale along with the compression. Changing the colour of images and contents of the PDF to grayscale helps in further reducing the file size of the PDF.\n\n-> Save disk storage space\nThe compressed PDF files also save storage space on the phone which could help in storing more other files to the device.\n\n-> Quick and efficient\nThe application is quick to compress PDF files and produces accurate results.\n\nNote :  Some PDF documents might not get compressed. This could happen when the PDF is already optimized to maximum extent or there are no compressable items in the PDF file."

To achieve this balance I spent a lot of time with paper and calculators trying various options.  I eventually decided that there should be an app to do it for me.  \n\nCraft Pricing Helper was written to quickly solve that problem.  While,  I personally use it for Etsy sales it isn't tied to that platform.  I left the options open to be of use in as many cases as possible.\n\nIf you usually time your project building in minutes, simply click on the word hours to switch to minutes.  You can switch back by pressing the word minutes and it will all be converted for you.\n\nThe app allows you to put a length of time to construct the project, the amount per hour you want to get paid, material cost and other costs you may have.  Using that information it will come up with your total cost.  Using the cost, you set a margin and it will tell you the price you should charge along with the profit you will make.\n\nIt doesn't get any easier than that."

Settings are saved in the app so that when you use the app next time it will calculate with your chosen settings.\n\nDensities can be entered in the following formats which are automatically recognized:\ne.g 0.9664 / 966.4 / 9664\n\nThe app can calculate for crude oil, black and white products, lubrication oils and special applications, and input can be changed between density in vacuum at 15 and 20 deg C/ API / relative density / observed, and degrees Celsius / Fahrenheit by touching the applicable buttons.\n\nThe user has the choice to calculate using as input observed M3 / M3 at 15 / observed Barrels / Barrels 60 / Metric tons air/vac / Ltons / Gallons.\n\nThe user can also calculate weights of LPG / NGL, using either density @ 15C, relative density @60F, observed density or density @ 20C.\n\nAside from the conversion screen with conversions between API, observed density, density 15, density 20 and relative density, there is also a screen with conversions used in LPG / NGL.\n\nFor products, lube oils and crude there are two tools for calculating final density when blending two components: one tool that calculates the blend after loading the 2nd component, and another tool that lets the user choose the two components and advises which component to load first, based on density 15C or API 60F and actual temperature of the components. Both tools also calculate volume shrinkage due to blending.\n\nA utility has been included that enables the user to export data from the calculator screen directly into a database for future reference. The same utility can be used to enter data manually and edit previously entered data.\n\nFor a detailed tutorial please visit our webpage (http://mooringmarineconsultancy.wordpress.com)."

Less time engineering means more one-on-one time with the customer!\n\nHVAC heat loads can be a cumbersome and time consuming and tend to distract from time spent consulting.  SwiftSize addresses this problem by allowing complete heat loads to be performed in mere minutes.  If it takes you more than 10 minutes with SwiftSize you're doing something wrong!\n\nSwiftSize is not a comprehensive room-by-room heat loss/heat gain/CFM calculator.

See why tens of thousands of engineers, technicians, and architects have licensed our software for their HVAC engineering needs.\n\n(For full online help, click here: http://bit.ly/1GlRulY.\n\nFor training webinar, click here: http://bit.ly/1IHn7nA)\n\nThis app now includes the HVAC Equipment Locator. Click here for details: http://bit.ly/1yTq539.\n\nThis app allows you to perform detailed block and room-by-room heating and cooling loads for residential buildings out in the field, by taking advantage of the simplicity and power of the iPhone.\n\nThis app was designed by Carmel Software Corporation, a 25-year old software design firm specializing in engineering analysis software applications. We are not just 1 person designing mobile apps out of a bedroom. We are a team of software developers and engineers with over 50 years combined software and engineering design experience. In fact, our software powers the analysis capabilities of major Autodesk (The makers of AutoCAD) software tools such as Autodesk Revit. \n\nThe following is just a small sample of the features included in this app:\n\n1. Calculations based upon abridged ACCA Manual J8 calculations (This is not an ACCA-approved app. For our ACCA-approved iPad app, search for the HVAC ResLoad-J app on the app store)\n\n2. Includes a 1000+ world-wide city weather database\n\n3. Includes data for 100s of construction types for walls, roofs, floors, doors, windows, skylights, ceilings, and more\n\n4. Allows you to create and store an unlimited number of projects\n\n5. Allows you to create an unlimited number of rooms and view individual loads and airflows for those rooms\n\n6. Allows you to specify an unlimited # of opaque types (ie – doors, walls, roofs, floors, ceilings), window types, and skylight types for each building\n\n7. Allows you to instantly view total heating and cooling load results as you update input data\n\n8. Allows you to view comprehensive cooling and heating load breakdown reports including breakdown by opaque load, window load, skylight load, infiltration load, ventilation load and internal load contributions\n\n9. Opaque inputs include opaque type, opaque construction number, dimensions, and opening areas\n\n10. Window inputs include window type, internal and external shading type, overhang dimensions, window area, and more..\n\n11. Additional input types include # of people, # of bedrooms, ventilation airflow, and more..\n\n12. Includes ability to display a wide variety of on-screen reports including checksum reports (ie – BTUh/SqFt, SqFt/Ton, etc.), complete heating and cooling load breakdown reports, and even graphically-pleasing pie charts showing cooling and heating load breakdowns\n\n13. Includes the ability to display a comprehensive HTML report that you can email to yourself or others, and it also includes a spreadsheet attachment that you can open in Excel to further massage data on your desktop\n\n14. Includes English (IP) or Metric (SI) units\n\n15. This is the same technology that powers the Trane MAP iPad app that they offer to their elite dealer network\n\nThe benefits of using this app are numerous including:\n\n1. Great for use out in the field. Quickly size heating and cooling equipment, show the client, then email the results back to your office for further analysis.\n\n2. Show off your advanced on-screen reports to clients convincing them you are using cutting-edge technology\n\n3. Save time by inputting information in the field and then returning to your office to perform more in-depth analysis"

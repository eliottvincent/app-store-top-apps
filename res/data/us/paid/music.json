      "label": "Have you ever struggled to find confidence on stage or inspiration in the studio? AeroPads cues immersive pads and soundscapes that inspire and equip you to perform your very best every time.\n\nENHANCE YOUR SOUND. ENGAGE YOUR AUDIENCE.\nEvery musician has experienced an empty mix or an awkward transition. When using AeroPads, you instantly add more dimension and character to your sound. With a more immersive mix and the ability to perform smooth and seamless transitions, you will feel more confident while your audience will be more engaged.\n\nFOR EVERY MUSICIAN.\nPads and soundscapes are a versatile accompaniment to nearly any style of music. Whether you are a soloist or full band, AeroPads will take your sound to the next level. Rock bands, worship teams, wedding singers, producers, songwriters, and instrumentalists are just a few of the many types of musicians that have loved using AeroPads.\n\nDESIGNED FOR THE STAGE. INSPIRED BY SPACE.\nAeroPads features creative and immersive soundscapes paired with a beautiful and intuitive interface, all inspired by the pinnacle of exploration and inspiration: outer space.\n\nCREATIVITY THAT SPARKS CREATIVITY.\nAeroPads aren't your typical pads. Most pads out there are really boring or insanely obnoxious. However, AeroPads features thoughtfully crafted soundscapes that are meticulously fine-tuned with the perfect amount of harmonic and textural movement. Simply put, AeroPads won't step on the toes of your arrangement or get on the nerves of your sound guy (like most other pads out there).\n\n\nHighlighted Features:\n- A beautiful space-inspired interface with a simple and intuitive design.\n- Live View: Every key and three of your favorite patches are instantly accessible (best suited for experimentation, free-flowing sets, and songwriting).\n- Setlist View: Plan and build a detailed setlist (best suited for structured sets and seamless transitions).\n- The iconic Atmosphere Soundpack which includes five unique patches named after and inspired by the layers of Earth's atmosphere. \n- Three patches can be added to Live View to be made instantly accessible, so there's no need to dig through menus to just to change a patch when performing live.\n- Additional patches and soundpacks available for purchase.\n\n\nHow to Use:\n01. Cue a pad that matches the key of your musical arrangement.\n02. Play overtop of the accompanying pads and soundcapes.\n03. Enjoy the boost of audience engagement, musician confidence, and creative inspiration.\n\nPads and soundscapes are intended as a subtle accompaniment to musical arrangements/performances. They are designed to be cued according to the key of the arrangement. Once cued, you'll hear a droning pad centered around the root note with additional harmonic textures within the major scale. Pads can accompany arrangements of both minor and major scales. To accompany an arrangement within a minor scale, cue the relative major (Example: to accompany an arrangement in the key of A minor, cue \"C\"). A pad's key should not be changed to match chord changes within an arrangement. The only time a pad's key should change within a song is in the instance of a key change. For best results, mix AeroPads appropriately within the overall mix. When mixed too loud, AeroPads may compete with melodies and the arrangement. When mixed too quietly, AeroPads may be less effective. When mixed appropriately, they will sound awesome."

Silo combines microscopic granulation with macroscopic reverb tails to extract new realms from your existing sounds.\n\nSilo's first section, the granulator, breaks the incoming signal to tiny little bits (called \"grains\") before reconstructing it with massive amounts of control. You can change the speed and pitch of the signal independently and in real-time!\n\nThese grains are then sent to Silo's unique spatializer, which throws the grains all over the stereo field. The spatializer contains a number of motion algorithms to add trajectory to your grains, such as the orbital \"Moons\", the shooting \"Meteors\", or the squirmy \"Biological\". After using this spatializer, you'll never want to use a traditional auto-panner ever again.\n\nFinally, the signal washes through one of Silo's many reverb algorithms, from small, resonant spaces to enormous, booming voids. From \"Bokeh\" to \"Nebula\", each mode can be tweaked to frame your sound perfectly.\n\nAs an AUv3 plugin, Silo has been tested to work perfectly with Garageband, Drambo, AUM, Cubasis, Beatmaker, Nanostudio, apeMatrix, Loopy Pro, and more! Additionally, with its clear layout and smart resizing, Silo can be used on tablets and phones with ease."

      "label": "\"LO‑FI‑AF is a very capable lo‑fi toolkit capable of surgically targeted destruction and it could easily find applications in just about any musical genre\" -SoundOnSound\n\nUnfiltered Audio's lo-fi-af is now available on iOS as a Standalone app or AUv3 plugin!\n\nlo-fi-af takes your sound on a journey of artifacts and noise throughout recorded history, from tape warbles and vinyl noise to MP3 chirps and cell phone speaker chatter. lo-fi-af's many sections and versatile algorithms can place your sound in a different decade, or give it a thoroughly modern spin through compound processing.\n\nThe first section is a convolution reverb preloaded with impulse responses from broken microphones, toy speakers, cell phones, and more. With this section alone, you can place your sound into an entirely different space.\n\nThe Spectral section then splits your sound into thousands of frequencies before reconstructing it with a twist. Here you can reproduce the sound of a pirated MP3 or pitch shift your signal with clean perfection.\n\nYour signal then takes a trip through the digital section. All sorts of hazards are present here, from a skipping CD stutter effect to a multimode bitcrusher.\n\nFinally, the rich, colorful analog section adds that vibe that you crave. A maximizer, a tape saturator, a noise generator, an analog-style filter, a pitch warbler, and a radio demodulator all work together in harmony to toss your sound into the past.\n\nBut wait! That's only one possible signal chain. The Convolution, Spectral, Digital, and Analog sections can be completely rearranged in any order. Dozens of presets will get your started on your sound warping adventure.\n\nAs an AUv3 plugin, lo-fi-af has been tested to work perfectly with Garageband, Drambo, AUM, Cubasis, Beatmaker, Nanostudio, apeMatrix, Loopy Pro, and more! Additionally, with its clear layout and smart resizing, lo-fi-af can be used on tablets and phones with ease.\n\n(Note for Drambo users: Drambo does not yet have automatic Plugin Delay Compensation for managing plugins with latency. As a result, tracks with lo-fi-af will not line up properly with other tracks. An upcoming patch for Drambo will add this feature in.)"

      "label": "Unfiltered Audio's Tails is now available on iOS as a Standalone app or AUv3 plugin!\n\nUnfiltered Audio joined forces with electronic music superstar BT to create Tails, the world's most harmonic reverb.\n\nTails utilizes a novel double-buffered technology to create two separate reverbs in parallel. The twist comes with special threshold swapping: Whenever Tails detects a major change in amplitude or tone, it can smoothly swap between the two reverbs. Additionally, Tails can auto-duck on its inputs and outputs.\n\nThis keeps your reverb as clean as possible. With auto-ducking on attacks, you can keep the metallic noise of percussive hits out of your reverbs. Alternatively, you can keep passing tones and blue notes out of your melodic echoes so that your reverb is free of dissonance.\n\nEven without its innovative ducking and swapping, Tails is the most flexible reverb in your arsenal. Two of Unfiltered Audio's classic BYOME reverb algorithms (Renoun and Deep) are available with a Spatial mode inspired by Silo and a brand new Shimmer mode designed to BT's exacting specifications. In true Unfiltered Audio fashion, a global Sample Rate knob affects the sampling rate of the entire DSP algorithm, stretching your reverb tails out into crispy, lo-fi oblivion.\n\nFinally, Tails is built to be performed. Your MIDI keyboard's Pitch and Mod wheels can be assigned quickly to a selection of key parameters, while Note messages can be used to manually duck or mute the reverb.\n\nAs an AUv3 plugin, Tails has been tested to work perfectly with Garageband, Drambo, AUM, Cubasis, Beatmaker, Nanostudio, apeMatrix, Loopy Pro, and more! Additionally, with its clear layout and smart resizing, Tails can be used on tablets and phones with ease.\n\n(Note for Drambo users: Drambo does not yet have automatic Plugin Delay Compensation for managing plugins with latency. As a result, tracks with Tails will not line up properly with other tracks. An upcoming patch for Drambo will add this feature in.)"

      "label": "\"Super powerful plugin... Highly recommended.\" - The REAPER Blog\nhttps://reaperblog.net/2022/01/bass-mint/\n\nUnfiltered Audio's Bass Mint is now available on iOS as a Standalone app or AUv3 plugin!\n\nBass Mint is a simple-to-use but immensely powerful bass and sub enhancement utility. You can use it to add extra bass to your kick drums, or to make podcast voices more full-bodied.\n\nWith five different modes, Bass Mint can either accentuate and clean up existing bass in your input signal, or it can synthesize new bass from scratch! The SYNTHESIZE and RESONATE modes can be tuned to specific frequencies, allowing you to make any percussive hits sound more in tune with the rest of your song (For extremely quick tuning, dozens of presets are included with correct frequencies for all note values).\n\nBass Mint includes multiple methods of making your bass sit better in the mix. The ANTI-RUMBLE filter removes all inaudible bass from your track, clearing up some headroom to make the audible frequencies louder. MID ONLY affects only center-channel bass, while MONO BASS places all bass below the cutoff directly into the center of the stereo field. The CLARITY knob acts as a quick de-mud control to scoop out some of the mids.\n\nAs an AUv3 plugin, Bass Mint has been tested to work perfectly with Garageband, Drambo, AUM, Cubasis, Beatmaker, Nanostudio, apeMatrix, Loopy Pro, and more! Additionally, with its clear layout and smart resizing, Bass Mint can be used on tablets and phones with ease."

      "label": "As seen on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon -- Create music with Loopy HD by layering looped recordings of singing, beatboxing, or playing an instrument with a savvy, sophisticated, tactile looper that totally reinvents the formula.\n\nhttps://loopyapp.com\n\n-- “This is the best loop station on the iPhone” -- Dub FX (dubfx.net) \n-- “I pretty much own every mobile looper out there and Loopy is HANDS DOWN the best. Super simple interface with powerful features.” -- J. Alan Meier \n-- “If you want a recording app that will get out of the way and just let you be creative, you just found it.” -- Dave Merson-Hess, indie film composer\n-- “Loopy 2 is by far the best looper for the iPhone we’ve seen to date” -- iOS Recording\n\nCompatible with the Audiobus app: Record and loop live audio directly from other Audiobus-compatible apps!\n\nWhile other music creation apps tend to be either powerful but difficult to learn, or easy to use but limited in features, Loopy doesn't compromise. Loopy offers a sleek, expressive, instantly understandable interface that beginners can start using effectively straight away. It's fun, right from the start. \n\nMore advanced users, however, will not be disappointed by Loopy's rich feature set, with extra features many other loopers just don't have. Plus, a sophisticated interactive tutorial system lets users discover Loopy's more advanced features at their own pace. \n\nRECORD & LAYER\n\n- Six, nine, or twelve beautifully rendered circular loops, with simple yet powerful controls. \n- Count-in, count-out and record chaining lets you keep your hands free to play an instrument.\n- MIDI control, to control Loopy via foot pedal or other controller.\n- Overdub, to build beautiful, complex soundscapes from many layers. \n- Support for tracks of any multiple or fraction of a beat, for flexible and expressive looping. \n- Sophisticated audio or visual metronome to keep you in time - no matter what time signature you choose. \n- Perfectly synchronized, low latency audio engine. \n- Robust MIDI clock receive and send, and support for Ableton Link.\n\nIMPORT & CONSTRUCT \n\n- Import loops from your computer via iTunes, with support for AIFF, WAV, MP3, M4A, CAF and more. \n- Bring in audio from many other audio apps with integrated audio copy and paste. \n- Imported loops are automatically fit to your beat, no matter what tempo. \n\nMANIPULATE & TWEAK \n\n- Full stereo audio, with pan controls for each track to create custom stereoscapes. \n- Fix up timing by twisting tracks around to line up the beat, or make funky sound effects with dynamic time shifting. \n- Drag a track onto another track to merge tracks, and clear up a space. \n- Live, dynamic tempo adjustment to speed up or slow down your creations, without altering the pitch. \n- MIDI clock sync, to play in time with other MIDI-capable devices or apps.\n\nPERFORM & SHARE \n\n- Record whole performances with in-app session recording facilities. \n- Upload performances or single loops straight to SoundCloud, and post to Twitter or Facebook.\n- Email audio clips.\n- Share audio with many other audio apps with audio copy and paste. \n- Transfer loops or performances to your computer via iTunes. \n\n-----\n\nLoopy is developed by one guy who loves making great apps, and who is dedicated to responsive development and support.

Note Rush is great for teaching keyboard geography by making sure each note is played in the correct octave. An indispensable music theory must-have for learning sight reading at all levels of music education.\n\n\"Great app for learning notes!\" - App Store Review.\n\n\"So much better than flash cards! My son loves using this app and his note reading has improved tremendously since starting.

I especially like using it at group lessons.\" - Leila Viss, 88pianokeys.me \n\n\"Note Rush has quickly become my favorite app for piano teaching.\" - Joy Morin, colorinmypiano.com\n\n\"Note Rush is a motivating app that engages students to improve quickly with their note reading skills. It is definitely one of my top favorites and will be used often!\" - Jennifer Foxx, musiceducatorresources.com\n\n\"Note Rush is a great way to review notes for the One Minute Club.\" - Susan Paradis, susanparadis.com\n\n*** Having trouble? See noterushapp.com/troubleshooting for help. ***\n\nListens to Your Instrument\n------------------------------\nNote Rush helps students learn a strong association between notes on the page and keys on your instrument by using your device's microphone to detect when you play each note. Works with pianos, keyboards, flutes, violins, you name it! (See Q&A below for more about supported instruments.)\n\nStudent-paced\n------------------\nNote Rush goes as fast or as slow as the student, with no time limits, so is suitable for complete beginners right through to being a fun challenge even for teachers!\n\nGrand Staff Context\n-----------------------\nThe whole grand staff is always visible, showing each note in full context and helping students improve their note recognition across the two staves.\n\nOctave-Sensitive Keyboard Geography\n---------------------------------------------\nIt's a \"B\", but which \"B\"?? Note Rush teaches keyboard geography by making sure you're getting the note in the right octave every time.\n\nGreat for Home Practise\n-------------------------\nStudents will rush to their instrument at home every day with NoteRush, chasing stars and high scores! Unlike flash cards, children can drill note identification at home with no music-reading parent required to check if they're getting them correct - Note Rush checks for you! Play every day and you'll be great at reading piano music in no time.\n\nLevels\n-------\nNote Rush has fifteen built-in Levels, from Middle C-Position right through to the full grand staff with 2 ledger lines above and below. There are Levels for Treble Clef, Bass Clef or full Grand Staff! Or make your own levels to practise reading specific notes, with sharps and flats for an added challenge!\n\nBetter Than Flash Cards!\n-------------------------\nUse Note Rush instead of printed flash cards! Note Rush was designed to replace the cards used in One Minute Club - a challenge you can run in your studio where students have to complete a given level in under a minute. Give it a try!\n\n--\nNote Rush is made by Thomas Grayston, a software developer, pianist, and husband to a piano teacher."

      "label": "Unfiltered Audio's Needlepoint is now available on iOS as a Standalone app or AUv3 plugin!\n\nUnfiltered Audio raises the bar (and lowers the tonearm) with Needlepoint: a revolution in vinyl simulation. Continuing the retro themes of their smashed-up hit lo-fi-af, Needlepoint presents a full platter of advanced physical modeling to dive deep into the warm, fuzzy sound of turntable noises and artifacts beloved by many. Of course, since this is an Unfiltered Audio plugin, you can push the needle far past realism and dive into some seriously warped sounds.\n\nWhile many vinyl plugins are content to use looping samples of noise, Needlepoint uses physical modeling to achieve its incredible sound. Needlepoint synthesizes all sorts and sizes of detritus and distress on a record: hair, dust mites, scratches, warping, etc. These are not randomly modeled, but rather accurately distributed onto a rotating, algorithmic platter. Changing the speed of the record can greatly change the nature of Needlepoint's impact on your sound. While you may be used to vinyl RPMs like 33 1/3, 45, and 78, have you ever wondered what it would sound like to tempo sync a turntable to your DAW? Now you can!\n\nBeyond noise, ambience, and tone, Needlepoint includes other effects to fully etch out your vibe. A single knob compressor (inspired by lo-fi-af's PRESS knob with six additional algorithms) can be added before or after the signal chain. This compressor can emulate algorithms from famous hardware samplers associated with vinyl, or even mimic the sound of analog distortion introduced by the vinyl pressing process. A BROKEN mode emulates a broken record a broken record a broken record a broken... Where were we? Oh right, a BROKEN mode acts as an unpredictable looper by jumping the grooves on your recent audio. You can automate the mode's toggle to create all sorts of cut-up and glitchy phrases.\n\nNo vinyl plugin would be complete without a SPINDOWN button that creates that classic vinyl stop (and start!) sound. Here you can control the rate of the spindown to better fit the effect into your mixes. Finally, at the end of the processing chain, Needlepoint features a granular pitch shifter to help you achieve that chopped up vibe without needing to manually change the speed of your tracks.\n\nDespite all of these features, Needlepoint is incredibly easy to use. With a beautiful interface and an extensive set of presets, Needlepoint will help you itch that nostalgic scratch that your tracks need.\n\nAs an AUv3 plugin, Needlepoint has been tested to work perfectly with Garageband, Drambo, AUM, Cubasis, Beatmaker, Nanostudio, apeMatrix, Loopy Pro, and more! Additionally, with its clear layout and smart resizing, Needlepoint can be used on tablets and phones with ease.\n\n(Note for Drambo users: Drambo does not yet have automatic Plugin Delay Compensation for managing plugins with latency. As a result, tracks with Needlepoint will not line up properly with other tracks. An upcoming patch for Drambo will add this feature in.)"

      "label": "Enjoy music at a deeper level with realtime visualization! Spectra is a lightweight music & audio visualizer app that allows you to select and visualize audio in realtime, right on your phone or mac. Want to export your visualization? We have you covered. Simply click the \"Create Video\" button from within the app. No longer do you need expensive software to create those beautiful animations you've seen on the internet. Want to customize the background image or put a logo in the center? We made that available as well. In fact, you can customize just about all aspects of the visualizer. You can even import audio files from apps like iMessage or Mail using the share sheet. We want to keep improving the app so If you have any suggestions, be sure to leave a review and tell us what feature you're missing!\n\nThe features:\n• Amazing, 60fps realtime visualization for any audio file, iTunes music (not Apple Music), or Spotify song\n• Video exporting of your audio visualization (does not support Spotify)\n• Custom background image\n• Background presets\n• Background effects\n• Custom logo image\n• Visualizer customization\n• Particle customization\n• Video export settings\n• Video animation options\n• Presets\n• More to come!!!\n\nHere's how it works:\nThe sound we hear is made up of many frequencies. The visualizer decomposes the audio input into its frequencies and displays the lower frequencies at the top/left of the audio spectrum and the higher frequencies at the bottom/right of the spectrum. This can create some cool-looking shapes that all correspond to the currently-playing audio track!\n\nWhether you're a producer that wants to see the frequency range of their song, an audiophile, or someone who wants to take a deeper look into their music, this app is definitely for you."

Anyone can jump in and play with over 160 included presets or lay fingers to the controls and begin exploring vast magical realms of creative potential for iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch and Mac. \n\nThe Minimoog Model D App incorporates a number of inspiring sound creation tools and capabilities not present on its analog antecedent. New functions include the ability to play chords with up to four-note polyphony, an easy-to-use arpeggiator for rhythmic pattern creation, a real time looping recorder with unlimited overdubbing capacity, a tempo-synchronizable stereo ping pong delay module, and the Bender -- a wide-range stereo time modulation effect module. \n\nThe Minimoog Model D App also supports AUv3 Audio Unit extensions, which allows multiple instances of this powerful instrument to be used simultaneously within compatible iOS apps supporting AUv3.\n\nA BRIEF HISTORY \nIntroduced by Moog in 1970, the Minimoog Model D served as the archetype for all electronic keyboards that followed. It gave users the ability to design their own sounds, translating imagination into reality. The Minimoog’s portability, affordability and accessibility made it the go-to instrument for musicians looking to expand beyond the traditional sounds of the time. Bernie Worrell used the Minimoog Model D to establish Parliament Funkadelic’s futuristic funk sound. Kraftwerk employed the Minimoog Model D on the successful concept album Autobahn, sparking an entirely new genre. Gary Numan replaced his live band’s guitars with Minimoog Model Ds, creating the prototype for industrial music. The classic sound of the Minimoog Model D can be heard on Bob Marley’s Catch A Fire, Michael Jackson’s Thriller and Dr. Dre’s The Chronic; Detailed in the mini-doc series “A Brief History Of The Minimoog”. \n\nFEATURES \n• Ships with over 160 presets (hundreds more available in the Minimoog Model D App Store) \n• Up to 4-notes of polyphony \n• Easily share presets and audio recordings with friends \n• Arpeggiator module with note-hold and chord latch capability \n• Stereo ping-pong delay effect \n• Bender time modulation effect \n• Real-time looping recorder with overdub and immediate sharing \n• Selectable envelope shapes and triggering behavior \n• Effortless MIDI CC mapping \n• Seamlessly backup presets to iCloud \n• Play mode for easier panel and keyboard interaction \n• A new take on the classic feedback/overload path \n\nSUPPORTS\n• All 64-bit iOS devices\n• AUv3 Audio Unit Extensions (Including GarageBand)\n• MPE Controller Support \n• Ableton Link \n• Inter-App Audio and Audiobus\n• 7 and 14-Bit MIDI \n• MIDI Program Change Support \n• Bluetooth LE MIDI controllers \n• Share over AirDrop, Mail, or other iOS applications"

      "label": "Sharpen your sense of time! liveBPM is the tempo monitoring tool for drummers, bands and DJs. It detects music and beats via the microphone and continuously displays the current tempo in beats per minute (BPM). It is easy to use and delivers high-quality results while being energy efficient.\n\n\n=== What users said about liveBPM ===\n\n\nJohn Walden, freelance musician and music technology journalist at musicappblog.com:\n\"There are three obvious applications for the app. First, it would make a brilliant practice tool for a drummer, allowing them to monitor just how good they are at keeping a steady tempo without the aid of a click track to guide them. Second, sat beside your kit during a performance, it would allow you to judge just how well you are hitting the ideal tempo for each song in your set. It’s not just drummers that can benefit for liveBPM as the third use is in mapping the tempo – and any tempo changes – in commercial recordings. While this is useful for drummers, it is instructional for almost any musician.\" \n\n\nJonLong:\n\"I used this at my last band practice and wasn't expecting it to work. I couldn't believe how quickly and accurately it started tracking the bpm, even despite the very loud volume of our music.\"\n\n\nPocketDrummer82:\n\"I am a professional drummer and I have been looking for something like this for years! Unless your playing with backing tracks or recording, Playing with a Click is too Mechanical. This app allows the tempo to breathe, and its like a little angel on your shoulder telling you the band is speeding up or slowing down. It is totally worth the money.\"\n\n\nChris Walther:\n\"I have used this about five gigs now and have quit using my previous tempo meter. I used both for a few gigs to test the accuracy. Dead on. Thanks! Every drummer should use this.\"\n\n\nmagrec:\n\"This has been very helpful for recording. thanks!\"\n\n\n\n\n=== Detailed Description ===\n\n\nThis is a tool designed for professional use:\n- Well-tested beat detection engine guarantees trustworthiness\n- Can handle most genres\n- Produces results accurate to within 0.1 BPM under the following conditions:\n-- The tempo is constant or almost constant\n-- Strong impulses are defining the beat (drums, accentuated rhythm instruments like bass/guitar, etc.)\n\n\nFurther features:\n- Tempo curve shows the development of tempo over time \n- Multiple zoom modes to show last 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 20 or 30 minutes\n- Advanced audio spectrum analysis via FFT\n- More accessible and usually more accurate than BPM counters that function through tapping\n- Low battery drain thanks to high performance code and efficient algorithms\n\n\nUsing it as a musician:\n- Use it as an objective tempo reference like a metronome\n- It actually has several advantages over a metronome:\n-- You are not tied to a click, giving you more flexibility\n-- Helps you use tempo changes to enhance your musical expression\n-- With blind tests, it can massively improve your timing confidence, which is especially important if you are in a tempo leading role (e.g. drummer)\n- Discover how/whether your favorite artists use tempo changes\n- Measure and improve your time-keeping skills\n- Identify slowdowns and speedups while practicing your instrument\n- Always be in control of the tempo during your live gigs and rehearsals\n\n\nControls:\n- Power Button: For freezing the tempo curve and minimizing battery drain\n- Clear Button: Clears the tempo curve\n- Slider: Adjusts the target tempo range (i.e. 80-160 BPM)\n- Zoom Buttons: Switch between zoom modes for the tempo curve. (2-30 minutes)\n\n\nNote: \n- You can check and improve the detection by clapping loud to the beat. Also, results can be improved by plugging in a suitable external microphone.\n- You can support my work by rating it on the App Store. If you have questions and/or suggestions, feel free to contact me via e-mail or facebook."

You can add to the factory sounds by importing your own pads or by purchasing one of the in-app sound packs.\n\n- Shape your sound. AutoPad's menu gives you control over crossfade time, high-pass and low-pass filters, reverb amount, pan, and volume.\n\n- Stay in sync. AutoPad features a customizable metronome with a dedicated pan control. Keep your band locked in without needing to lug around a tracks rig.\n\n- Deep MIDI Control. AutoPad's MIDI Actions menu makes it easy to customize how AutoPad responds to your MIDI controller.\n\n- Use with other apps. AutoPad comes with a fully-featured AUv3 plugin!

AutoPad lets you save and recall setlists with a simple setlist manager.\n\n- Looks great. AutoPad features a dark color scheme that is easy on the eyes and performs well on the stage.\n\n\nNote on use: \n\nAutoPad sounds great in a variety of contexts, but please make sure you understand the intended use before purchase.\n\nAutoPad's sounds are designed to be played softly and continuously behind live musicians. They include the root, fifth, and octave. As such, they can be used in a major or minor context. When using AutoPad in worship music, it is not necessary to change the pad with each chord change. For example, if you have a song in the key of E, you can play a pad in E for the duration of the song.\n\nView Manual: https://www.audiosymmetric.com/manuals.html\nView Tutorials: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9Uka-nFom-pgTB-DftgDvA"

      "label": "Music makes the ball field come to life but until now being the ballpark DJ wasn’t easy. \n\nWalkout Song DJ is here to make it simple to have every field filled with that pump-up music every athlete loves and needs for those big games.\n\nWalkout song DJ makes the difficult task of playing a walkout song for each individual batter as easy as tapping a button.  Simply enter the player name and number then select a song from your iTunes library. The precise segment from that walkout song can then be set by selecting a position and playback duration using a simple and precise editing view.  Press the play button and 11 seconds later you have one pumped-up batter, and a song that smoothly fades as the batter steps up to the plate.  You can also choose between imported, recorded, or computerized text-to-speech announcements for your players before, after, or mixed with their walkout song.\n\nThe game doesn’t stop between innings so why should the music?  Walkout Song DJ has a view dedicated to inning break songs.  Just as before, select a song from your iTunes library and set a position and duration.  Since inning breaks are usually two minutes long and most songs are over three minutes, Walkout Song DJ can automatically fade the song out before the start of play. That allows the human DJ to take a break or get a hot dog, and not have to worry about the music interrupting the game.\n\nThere is also one-touch access to a situational music view. These are the songs that add character to the game, such as your national anthem, Take Me Out to the Ball Game, Jeopardy Theme Song, your team fight song and anything else that fits!\n\nFor pre-game music, there is a pre-game view that allows you to select a group of songs from your library and arrange them in a simple playlist to play without interruption and help the athletes get “in the zone” during warm ups.\n\nIf you happen to be a dedicated ballpark DJ and have multiple teams to DJ, don’t sweat it. Walk-Out Song DJ makes it possible to create and save song pages for multiple teams.\n\nSo sit back, relax, and enjoy the game while playing the all-important music by barely lifting a finger.\n\nPlease NOTE:  The only subscription music source that will work with this app is Apple Music. The app is unable to access files from subscription sources like Spotify, Amazon Prime, Google Music, Tidal, or Napster because those services either have no third party offline playback interface or will not allow use of their interface with a third party commercial application.  I have requested commercial approval from several of them and have had no response.  The app will also work with standard music files either purchased from iTunes or imported to your device from email attachments or from cloud storage services."

      "label": "iDrumTune Pro is the world’s most advanced, accurate and intelligent system for assisting and educating on drum tuning – used by thousands of drummers all over the world. Now with Drum Kit Designer feature and detailed online tutorials.\n\nFeatured in Modern Drummer 'New and Notable' - July 2018  \n\n\"an invaluable aid not only for drummers but also studio engineers and producers\" - Sound on Sound Magazine\n\n\"I can’t recommend this app highly enough ... for the money, it is indispensable. It's simple, accurate, looks good, and the tuning information is worth the cost of the app alone.\" - www.mikedolbear.com\n\n“***** I never knew I could have this much fun tuning drums!” – Adamrod (App Store review)\n\n“***** Just tuned my first drum and this app is awesome!” – bburt85 (App Store review)\n\n“***** Buy this app if you are a drummer!!!” Lildrummerboy (App Store review)\n\nThe original and most innovative electronic drum tuning app - iDrumTune Pro brings unrivalled accuracy and features that have never been possible before for assisting with drum tuning. Built by world experts in drums and musical acoustics, and backed up by a detailed online training course on Drum Sound and Drum Tuning.\n\niDrumTune Pro includes the following features:\n\n* Pitch Tuning – to make your drums sing and allow you to play musical phrases around the kit\n\n* Lug Tuning – to ensure that the drumhead is evenly tuned and gives a smooth and warm tone\n\n* Resonant Head Tuning – to allow you to be sure that the two heads are working together and giving rich overtones\n\n* Spectrum Analyzer – so you can really start to understand what frequencies are excited and heard when playing the drums\n\n* Drum Kit Presets – so you can save and load your favourite tunings and share them with the world. Now also includes the interactive Drum Kit Designer feature.\n\n* The Science of Drum Tuning – and extensive manual on the science and art of drum tuning and getting the best out of iDrumTune Pro \n\niDrumTune is the first and by far the most intelligent and accurate system for analyzing drum sounds and assisting tuning – developed by drummers, music producers and acoustics research Professors. iDrumTune provides you with a measurement of the drumhead vibration frequency, much in the same way to an acoustic guitar tuner which measures the vibration frequency of a guitar string. In Pitch Tuning mode, you simply hold the iPhone over the center of a drum, about 2-4 inches away, and strike the drum in the center.\n\nThe iDrumTune readout shows the recorded sound waveform and gives the strongest frequency recorded. There is also a tuning indicator bar which shows the drumhead tuning relative to musical notes, so iDrumTune can be used to ensure that your drums are in key with each other or the song you are playing. A frequency spectrum view also allows more detailed analysis and helps with tuning the drum at the lug positions.\n\niDrumTune provides advanced tuning features including an intelligent filter function, Lug Tuning mode and Resonant Head Tuning mode. The filter allows unwanted frequencies to be ignored by the analysis algorithm, whilst Lug Tuning mode offers the simplest and most innovative method for tuning an even frequency response at the lug positions on the drumhead.\n\nThe Preset Manager allows you to save all your favourite drum tunings and call them up when you are in the middle of the process. Drum kits can also be exported and imported, so you can share your favorite tuning setups and load new ones in from other drummers.\n\nDrum Tuning isn’t easy, and drums don’t respond exactly the same way every time you hit them. For that reason, it's valuable to know a little about the science of drum tuning. iDrumTune includes a comprehensive text on the science of drums and drum tuning in order to help you get the best of iDrumTune and to become an expert drum tuner!\n\nWatch the iDrumTune tutorial videos and read reviews on iDrumTune at www.idrumtune.com"

      "label": "Benny Greb, well known for his contributions to the drumming education community, shared the approach that he has taken personally to develop his sense of groove and improve his own timing on his instrument in his course “The Art and Science of Groove”. Now with the Gap Click app, everyone can practice his method easily with a simple-to-use app! \n\nUnlike standard metronomes which simply state the time, Gap Click helps you improve your sense of time. Gap Click is more than a metronome with a focus on improving your ability to keep tempo, become more aware and comfortable with off beat clicks and by that, become bullet proof and accurate with all notes of the subdivision.\n\nGAP CLICK\nBy scrolling through the numbers of bars and patterns you can quickly configure a “gap” of time in which the metronome drops out. When the “one” comes back around, will your playing still be in time? How long of a gap can you play through and still maintain solid tempo?\n\nMOVING CLICK\nNext you can experiment with all kinds of off-beat patterns in the Gap Bar which moves the click from the downbeat position to a different location. Can you still play your instrument and maintain the downbeat internally even when you hear the click sound on an off-beat?\n\nBoth the “click” and the “gap” portion supports a variety of different syncopated patterns allowing you the ability to practice in binary or ternary rhythms - with more or less safety net depending on your settings.\n\nFeatures\n• Ability to choose from a variety of different syncopated patterns and # of measures for both the standard \"click\" as well as the \"gap\"\n• Use the nostalgic click wheel to find the right tempo or tap to set your desired tempo from 10 to 300bpm\n• Standard quarter-note time signatures: 2/4, 3/4, 4/4, 5/4, 6/4, 7/4\n\nPersonalize\n• See visual feedback for each note or rest that is played\n• Accent beat 1 of each measure or turn accents off for a greater challenge\n• Flash the screen for a visual indication when switching from the \"click\" to the \"gap\"\n• Find your favorite sound from a variety of click samples hand-picked by Benny\n\nBuy Once, Use Forever\n• There are no In-App Purchases - a one time purchase includes all current and future features. \n\nTESTIMONIALS\nWhat professionals are saying about GAP CLICK:\n• \"The skills you can sharpen by using this app are integral for what it takes to be a professional drummer in any genre.\" - Matt Halpern\n• \"When I first opened the app, it made (simple) sense, without a tutorial.\" - Chris Coleman\n• \"This app helps you lock in the pocket on a whole different level.\" - Luke Holland\n• \"The Gap Click app is something that every drummer should have in their toolbox.\" - Jared Falk, Drumeo\n\nWhat our users are saying about GAP CLICK: \n• \"If you think you have good timing, this will really put you in your place.\"\n• \"Gone are the days of programming gap clicks!\"\n• \"I’ve never had so much fun being destroyed in my practice session.\"\n• \"This is by far the best money I’ve ever spent on a practice tool.\"\n\nABOUT BENNY GREB\nBenny Greb is one of the most respected drummers in the world today. Not only has he headlined nearly every major drum festival and toured with his clinics and drum camps worldwide, but he is also recognized as a composer and bandleader in his own band Moving Parts, which won him the renowned “ECHO Jazz” award - the German equivalent to The Grammys in jazz.\n\nBenny Greb published two of the most successful and critically acclaimed educational products, “The Language of Drumming” and “The Art and Science of Groove” and he has helped create many signature products available to drummers today.\n\nFind him online at https://www.bennygreb.de as well as on social media."

It will leave out beats randomly to force you to strengthen your own inner time-keeping muscles, and it has other cool features for odd meters, drum machine-style patterns, and more... this is an awesome learning, grooving, solidifying tool.\"\n\nStrengthen your inner sense of rhythm! Time Guru is the only metronome with the ability to mute its sound at random, in sequenced patterns, or both, so that you can assess whether you tend to rush or drag or loose your place with odd meters. Time Guru can periodically leave you on your own so that you strengthen your own internal sense of time, rather than relying on the constant, rigid, external time keeping of a metronome. It's like training wheels that sometimes come up off the ground.\n\nTime Guru also features:  \n-the ability to play in different time signatures or sequences of time signatures\n-create rhythmic drum-machine like patterns\n-save presets for tempo, meter, sound and muting-\n-35 loud sound sets; \n-Human or robot voice counting in English, Chinese, French, German or Russian - great for teaching!\n-tap tempo (5 to 300 BPM range)\n-super accurate, rock-solid timing via a customized audio engine. \n\nAnd of course it can function as a normal metronome. \n\nNoTreble.com says: \"I love the aesthetic and layout of Time Guru. It’s very simple and elegant. Time Guru also offers ability to set randomness of your subdivisions (great for testing your internal clock)….There is one thing that Time Guru does that I absolutely love, and for which, this app will always live on my iPhone – at the top of the screen, you will see a series of numbers (1-7). When you press a number, it is set first in a sequence and you can choose a subdivision that will then repeat that number of times (or set it to rest that number of times). Sound confusing? It isn’t, because the layout is so simple. Every time you press a new number, it is set next in the sequence and you choose your continue to choose your subdivisions.\""

It's an incredible tool for all audio engineers and musicians ... My mixing has improved by leaps and bounds after just a few weeks with Quiztones.”\n\n- Austin McAllister\n\n\nA professional Audio Engineer of 10 years, I've come across many ear training devices, blind tests, and software. This app is TOPS! Highly recommended! The developers are serious about what they do. You will not be disappointed!\n\n- Joel Avery\n\n——\n\nWhy We Created Quiztones EQ Ear Training Apps ...\n\nWe thought there should be an easier way to learn how to use EQ, train your ears and expedite the path to getting professional quality mixes, recordings and productions.\n\nWhen I was at music school ten years ago studying audio engineering and music production, my teacher turned an iMac around, pulled up an EQ in Pro Tools and started quizzing the class on which audio frequencies he was boosting or cutting in a mix. That's when it hit me — this should be an app, with various difficulty levels, a scoring system and the ability to import your own source material for quizzes that will teach you how to use EQ like a pro.\n\nFast forward to today — 50k app downloads later — and we're still just as excited to keep evolving Quiztones to help you take the quality of your mixes, recordings and productions to the next level."

It allows each musician on stage to choose exactly what they hear in their monitor without affecting (or being able to affect, even by accident) the band's main mix.\n\nXAir Monitor Mixer supports the Behringer X18, XR18, XR16, XR12, and the Midas MR18 and MR12.\n\nXAir Monitor Mixer deliberately does not include controls that would allow a musician on stage to accidentally mute channels or otherwise alter the main mix.\n\nUsage:\n\n1. Connect to the same WiFi network as the XR18.  In most cases, this should be enough for the app to find your mixer. However, if your sound engineer has changed the default address of the mixer, you'll have to enter that address in the app's connection screen.\n2. Choose which monitor you want to mix. If your sound engineer hasn't named these in a way that makes it obvious which is yours, ask him which is yours.\n3. Mix away. :)\n\nIf you have feedback, suggestions, or bug reports, please visit the forums at xairmonitormixer.tetzfiles.com or send an email to xairmonitormixer@tetzfiles.com.\n\nNote: support for mixers other than XR18 was recently added. If you run into any issues, please let us know. Ensuring proper compatibility with all supported mixers is our top priority."

This works great for cases like vocal practice. By using a higher latency, pitch detection will not respond to momentary unintended sounds and noise (works great for instrument tuning).\r\n• Smart Detection - Use machine learning to enable pitch detection only when certain instruments or vocal sounds are detected."

      "label": "Way more than a metronome, the Time Trainer adds five training tools to help you develop your own internal sense of time!\n\nThis is an accurate and stable metronome (many metronome apps out there are not) and features:\n• tap tempo (to work out tempos by tapping a button),\n• countdown timer (for keeping your practice to schedule!)\n• many different sounds (you like cowbell, wood or xylophone?)\n• accent control (for odd time playing)\n• visual metronome movement with a flash on the beat\n• vibrate option (on each beat or just accent)\n\n...but then we add to that with five training tools which will really help you develop your own time feel - essential for all musicians!\n\n• Bar Breaks • will mute the metronome for a bar or more forcing you to keep your time solid and be perfectly synchronized when the clicks return! This is a superb exercise and will really help develop confidence in holding your tempo. You can adjust how many bars are solid at the start then how many bars are solid and how many bars are muted which will cycle for the duration of the session. You can also select \"random\" mode and a % of bars (that you set) that will be dropped for an even more challenging practice session!\n\n• Random Beat Drop • does exactly what it says on the tin... some of the beats (clicks) will be muted at random, forcing you to be confident with your time and not rely on the click too much. Many people chase the beat or try and anticipate it, and this exercise will help you stop those bad habits! I've personally found that the \"gradual\" setting is most useful, a five minute session starting at 100% with more and more beats muted up to the % that you set.\n\n• Speed Up • is a tool I have wanted for years for my own practice so now I made one. Often when working on scales, arpeggios or licks you want to start at an easy speed where you are playing it 100% correctly and gradually push your technique by playing it faster and faster. With this tool you set a start tempo, end tempo and duration of you practice session and off you go, no more stopping to bump the bpm up a few notches every minute!\n\n• Step Upper • Many people requested that we make a programmable mode, most likely to be used to be able to move from one consistent tempo to another, rather than the gradual increase you get in the Speed Upper. You can program a tempo for X number of bars OR minutes :)\n\n• Subdivisions • Another heavily requested feature was to add in subdivisions for those that need to hear them, and for super slow tempo's where having subdivisions can be really helpful!\n\nI'm sure you will find all of the tools very useful, and of course you will find full support on the justinguitar community forum - please take the time to rate and review it, good things will help promote it and anything negative will help me improve it!\n\nWishing you many happy hours of practice :) Justin"

The display shows the fine-tune value to allow exact recreation of any pitch\n√ Play one or two simultaneous tanpuras both controlled by the master pitch controls\n√ Each tanpura's first string can be tuned to Pa, Ma or Ni, or any custom note such as Re, Ga, Dha, etc \n√ Or tune first string to any shruti in the octave using a slider\n√ Each tanpura has its own pan and volume controls to allow precise placement within the stereo image. For example you can have a tanpura with Pa on your left and one with Ni on your right\n√ PRESETS: Save your favorite settings as named presets. Includes presets for the 100+ most popular raags. And now you can also export/import presets via email or iTunes File Sharing.\n√ Turn the Sur-Peti/Shruti Box on or off and adjust its volume from the settings page\n√ Can be used with speakers, headset, or the internal speaker (a high-quality speaker dock is recommended for maximum effect)\n________________________________________\n\nNot yet convinced?

      "label": "\"This really is the synth that keeps on giving! Inspiration and intuition truly blend together in this musical instrument.\"  Alan Parsons\nSunrizer Synth is a virtual analog synthesizer that takes the definition of iOS synthesizer to the next level. \nThanks to carefully designed architecture and heavy usage of coprocessor it blurs the boundaries between iOS and hardware synthesizers. \nSunrizer was built to perform and works perfectly with any MIDI keyboard or sequencer. A lot of research has been done in order to achieve unheard warmth and clarity. \n\nHIGHLIGHTS \n· True SuperSaw sound emulation, first found in the legendary Roland JP-8000 synthesizer. SuperSaw is a layered waveform consisting of multiple saw waves which are detuned to create an extremely full and epic sound. \n· Two filters per voice with configurable routing. 15 filter types available, including less common like Comb, Formant or Frequency shifter. \n· The Morph Group function lets you continuously morph of up to 30 parameters in a sound (including effects), using only the modulation wheel. \n· Full support for CoreMidi, MIDI mapping, Virtual Midi Ports and background audio.\n· Multi mode lets you multiply oscillators to get unbelievably fat and full sound. \n· Support for microtuning - load scl and tun files. Create fascinating microtonal music which uses intervals not found in the Western system of 12 equal intervals to the octave.\n\nOSCILLATORS \n· 2 warm-sounding analog modelled oscillators, 2 sub-oscillators (except SuperSaw). Available waveforms: Saw, PWM pulse,Triangle, SuperSaw, FM (frequency of phase modulation). 6 oscillators per voice in multi-sono mode. \n· Oscillator 2 hard-sync and configurable routing \n· FM (true frequency modulation) and PM mode \n· Osc-mix, ring modulator \n· White noise oscillator \n\nFLEXIBLE MULTI FILTERS \n· Two independent filters per voice with configurable routing. Filter types: LPF, HPF, BPF, Analog LPF, Notch, Comb, All pass, Power LPF, Power BPF, Wave shaper, Resonator, Resampler, LPF+Resampler, Frequency shifter. \n· Configurable routing: serial or parallel with bypass option. \n· ADSR envelope, keyboard tracking and full LFO control. \n\nMODULATION \n· Two LFOs per voice. It's possible to assign each LFO to almost any parameter. 3 LFO running modes: trigger, 1 shot, global. 6 waveforms, phase and fade-in knobs.\n· The Morph Group function lets you continuously morph of up to 30 parameters in a sound (including effects), using only the modulation wheel. \n· Two Modulation ADSR Envelopes for amplitude and filters cutoff. \n· Pitch and modulation wheels. \n\nEFFECTS \n· A number of effects are built in: distortion, hi-q reverb, chorus, rotary speaker simulation, equalizer, phaser and stereo delay. Dual-band FX processing. \n\nARPEGGIATOR \n· Sunrizer incorporates very powerful programmable arpeggiator. You should think of it more like a small step sequencer. \n\nOTHER FEATURES \n· Over 380 presets, 7 additional banks available for FREE in web library (more coming soon)\n· Hold button allows you to to keep notes sustaining until you play new notes\n· With Chord Memory function you can play the chord by only pressing single keys\n· Phrase sequencer\n· Compatible with AudioBus \n· Adjustable polyphony: 6-20 voices \n· Playback modes: poly, solo, arp \n· Built-in recorder supporting AudioCopy, DropBox and iTunes file sharing. \n· Supports AUv3, MIDI, IAA, AudioBus 2.0\n\nVisit www.beepstreet.com for user manual and audio demos. \n* Sunrizer is now available on Mac and PC, check our website for more info\n\n\"Specs aside, the most important thing is the sound… and it’s great.\" musicradar.com \n\n\"Sunrizer is the first truly mature polyphonic synth for the iPad, a real, smooth and powerful sounding option for all sorts of stage and studio performances.\"\nMark Jenkins, author \"Analog Synthesizers\""

(A device with a TrueDepth camera is required.)\n• Use a Bluetooth page turner, such as those from Coda Music Technologies, PageFlip, and AirTurn.\n• Create links to jump or scroll from one page to another. Links are great for music with repeats or codas, and they offer a powerful way to automatically scroll music at a pace that works best for you.\n• Use the pencil and highlighter tools to write on music with your finger or the Apple Pencil. All Apple Pencil settings are supported.\n• Add text with options for size, rotation, color, font, and justification.\n• Drag and drop symbols to add fingerings, dynamics, accidentals, and more to your music.\n• Use the low-latency metronome with options for sound, visuals, accent, and count off.\n\nShare and archive:\n\n• Share your music and collections with other Paperless Music users, with or without your annotations.\n• Share music in native format to preserve all information, or share in PDF format for general sharing and printing.\n• Archive your library to easily back up, restore, or transfer everything to another device.\n\nOther features:\n\n• Experience the app in either light or dark mode.\n• Adjust the text size in the Settings app to boost or shrink the size of text throughout the app.\n• Learn more about the app by reading the integrated, searchable user guide, accessible from the app’s home screen and from the website.\n• Use split screen to view another app alongside.\n• Aside from importing music and playing back tracks from remote sources, no network access is required throughout the app, allowing you to perform in any environment.\n\nPaperless Music has no ads, no in-app purchases, and no subscriptions.

      "label": "Grand Finale has been given some much needed love and attention resulting in a major face lift and a some extra horse power under the hood - resulting in Grand Finale 2!  The iOS app now has custom interfaces for iPhone and iPad, and it works both as standalone and as an AUv3 plugin.\n\nGrand Finale 2 is a multi effect audio processing application designed for finalizing complete mixes, stems, voice overs, buses and/or individual audio tracks. The plug-in offers several modules in a pre-routed configuration. Each module has parameters to alter, and most modules offer a set of algorithms to select. These features come together to make Grand Finale a powerful tool for quickly finalizing a track, bus or mix.\n\nUsage:\n\nImport audio files, or extract from a video in the camera roll. Audio can also be imported by using the “Open In..” option in any other app that can export audio.\nUse the playback controls to start and stop playing, and alter the module knobs/options to change how the audio is processed. When satisfied with the result, tap Export to render and save the finalized audio file.\n\nIncluded DSP Modules:\n\nMain bus processing\n\n   • High Pass filter\n\n   • Compressor\n\n   • Multiband Compressor\n\n   • MS Stereo Tool\n\n   • Equalizer\n\n   • Limiter\n\nAdditive/parallel processing\n\n   • Compressor\n\n   • Distortion\n\n\nOther features:\n\n   • Accurate RMS and LUFS metering (tap the meters to swap)\n\n   • 37 professionally made factory presets.\n\n   • Load / Save custom user presets\n\n   • Project manager (load / save full state including audio file data)\n\n   • User manual bundled inside app.\n\n   • Parallel processing is phase linear.\n\n   • Exports to WAV/AIFF/AAC at 16, 24 or 32 bits (sample rate is preserved)\n\n\nListening examples (pre/post) available here: https://soundcloud.com/klevgrandproducts/sets/grand-finale-audio-examples\n \nSaid about Grand Finale:\n\n“The magic behind this plugin is the compressor on the bottom portion, the stereo processor and the incredible EQ section. The bass and treble EQ (in default mode) is the best I've heard by far in a plugin.“ - Robbie Soukiasyan (Skrillex, Tiesto, Usher and more..)\n\n“...and Grand Finale is a genuinely impressive processor for not only the master output, but also mix busses and even individual tracks…” - Computer Music Magazine (CM254)\n\n“Overall, we are impressed by Grand Finale. The plug-in is well thought out and has a very modern, sleek user interface that doesn’t compromise on intuitiveness, metering, or other relevant information and features. Such things help with standing out in the crowded mastering/finalization plug-ins market.” - Gearnews.com"

      "label": "Mononoke is an unconventional synthesizer, designed to compose evolving soundscapes and musical textures. \n\nFeedback routing\nWhat sets Mononoke apart from other synths is that its voices (4 in each section) can be routed back into each other in multiple ways, creating all sorts of overtones and pulsating resonant frequencies. Sometimes harmonic, sometimes weirdly atonal. Sometimes clear and delicate as icicles, sometimes harsh as metallic blades, sometimes soft as fresh snow. This interaction between voices helps fuse all layers together into a coherent musical landscape. \n\nA tale of two engines\nThe synthesizer engines (each of the two sections has its own independent engine) have relatively simple controls, which influence a complex system of many invisible, interconnected LFOs. But this is not your bread-and-butter general purpose synthesizer: think of Mononoke as one huge FM synthesizer where each voice is an independently playable operator. Together all operators contribute to a single soundscape.\n\nExpressive pads\nComplex soundscapes can be created live, using the 8 performance pads which let you modulate each voice independently in several dimensions. Your interactions with the pads will also be sent out as MPE/MIDI (when loaded as an AU plugin in a compatible host) so you can record and tweak your session. The onscreen pads can be latched individually so some voices can be used as drones, while others as can be added and removed as extra sonic layers. The pads are fully integrated in the Audio Unit plugin.\n\nConnectivity\nMononoke is designed as an AUv3 plugin, with advanced Audio Unit features such as MPE input and output (!), a fully exposed array of AU parameters for automation and all the connectivity and scalability you can expect from modern plugins. \n\nThe standalone mode is basic (just meant for jamming and creating presets) and does not offer any connectivity, so if you want to use Mononoke in conjunction with other apps and effects you'll need to load it into a host, such as Garageband, Audiobus, AUM or Cubasis.\n\nSummary:\n- Audio Unit (AUv3) plugin\n- 8 voice polyphony, 2 independent engines with 4 voices each\n- Compatible with MPE (MIDI Polyphonic Expression) and MIDI\n- MIDI Input and Output (only available when used as an Audio Unit plugin)\n- Limited standalone mode for jamming (full screen, no connectivity)\n- 8 independently tunable performance pads for expressive interaction\n- Universal, fully scalable to any screen size, supports fullscreen mode in AU hosts\n- Freely tunable voices, or quantized to semitones (with overall finetuning)\n- iOS10 (MIDI/MPE output from the plugin requires iOS11) or higher\n\nAlso contains Mononoke Pads: an extra AUv3 MIDI controller plugin for playing MPE compatible synths using Mononoke's pads. Note: this is a separate plugin which will be installed in your MIDI Plugin collection. Mononoke Pads requires iOS 11."

Learning your part is now as accessible as reaching in your pocket.  Owning a piano and having the skills to play it are no longer necessary to learn your vocal part.  Listen and practice anywhere—while getting ready in the morning, while making dinner, or on the go.  Plus, with Sing Your Part you can adjust the volumes of all voices so you can practice harmonizing with the other parts.  Soon you will be able to sing hymns in a comfortable voice range alongside others singing different harmonies.  \n\nPastors and music leaders can prepare the whole church for worship by supplying a list of hymns for the upcoming church service.  Church members then simply click on “This Week” to see this list of hymns and can come to church better-prepared to worship God.  \n\nIMPORTANT:  Sing Your Part is geared for older hymns in the public domain and not newer copyrighted worship music.   Parts are played on a MIDI piano, and do not include voices or words.\n\nFeatures:\n\n•\tBrowse available hymns\n•\tSearch for a specific hymn \n•\tIndependently adjust soprano, alto, tenor, and bass volumes\n•\tChange tempo\n•\tAdjust song location to practice a particular part of the song\n•\tPractice this week’s hymns for your upcoming church service if your music leader is using Sing Your Part"

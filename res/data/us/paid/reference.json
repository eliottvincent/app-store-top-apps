      "label": "Find the right word wherever you go. The official RhymeZone iOS app is a fast, powerful rhyming dictionary and thesaurus that you can use anywhere, even if you're not on the net. Quickly find rhymes, near rhymes (including slant rhymes), synonyms, antonyms, homophones, similar sounding words, words with the same consonant pattern, and other related words (generalizations, specializations, words appearing in the same context). Use Apple's local dictionaries or ours online if you are unsure of any meanings.\n\nYou get a database of over 150,000 words and phrases right at your fingertips. Find rhymes without an Internet connection, but if you are online, we'll connect you to RhymeZone.com for definitions and all the other great features you've come to love, ad-free! Or you can look it up on our sister site, OneLook.com, or even hear it pronounced with your device's built-in text-to-speech.\n\nThere's also a nifty \"Poet Maker\" feature, which lets you find words that match constraints on both rhyme and meaning at the same time. For example, suppose you want a word that rhymes with \"cat\" and means \"heavy\"; this feature will answer \"fat\" in no time. Or suppose you're looking for a rhyme of \"curious\" that means \"invalid\"; you'll get \"spurious\". You get the idea!\n\nSo whether you're aspiring to be the next Shakespeare, looking to put on the finishing touches of a love poem, bust out the next rap lyric, or just seeking some clever wordplay for your English assignment, give the app a try!"

It will bring up the “My Favorites” screen, where you can click on that product and bring it up immediately.

It has the largest database of any astronomy app, includes every solar system object ever discovered, offers unparalleled accuracy, advanced planning and logging tools, flawless telescope control, and provides the very best experience under the stars when you depend on it. Don’t postpone joy. Discover why SkySafari is the #1 recommended astronomy app for serious amateur astronomers since 2009.\n\nHere's what’s new in version 7:\n\n+ Complete support for iOS 15 and iPhone 13. Version 7 brings a new and immersive stargazing experience.\n\n+ Events Finder - go to the new Events section to unlock a powerful search engine that finds astronomical events visible tonight and far into the future. The finder dynamically generates a listing of moon phases, eclipses, planetary moon events, meteor showers and planetary phenomenon such as conjunctions, elongations and oppositions.\n\n+ Notifications - the notifications section has been completely revamped to allow you to customize and manage which events trigger an alert notification on your device.\n\n+ Telescope Support - telescope control is at the heart of SkySafari.  Version 7 takes a giant leap forward by supporting ASCOM Alpaca and INDI.  These next generation control protocols allow you to effortlessly connect to hundreds of compatible astronomical devices.\n\nStargazing is often done on your own but looking up at the stars reminds us that we are all part of a larger interconnected universe. SkySafari 7 brings social stargazing to mobile devices with two new features to help you connect with other like minded people.\n\nOneSky - allows you to see what other users are observing, in real time.  This feature highlights objects in the sky chart and indicates with a number how many users are observing a particular object.\n\nSkyCast - allows you to guide a friend or group around the night sky through their own copy of SkySafari. After initiating SkyCast, you can generate a link and conveniently share it with other SkySafari users via text message, apps or social media accounts.\n\n+ Sky Tonight -  jump to the new Tonight section to see what’s visible in your sky tonight.  Expanded information has been designed to help plan your night and includes  Moon & Sun info, calendar curations, events and the best positioned deep sky and solar system objects.\n\n+ Improved Observation Tools - SkySafari is the perfect tool to help you plan, record and organize your observations.  New workflows make it easier to add, search, filter and sort data.\n\nThe Small Touches:\n\n+ You can now edit the Jupiter GRS Longitude Value in the Settings.\n+ Better Moon Age calculation.\n+ New grid & reference options allow you to display Solstice and Equinox markers, Orbit + Node markers for all solar system objects, and tick marks and labels for the Ecliptic, Meridian, and Equator reference lines.\n+ Previous In-app Purchases are Now Free -  this includes the H-R diagram, 3D Galaxy view, and the PGC galaxy and GAIA star catalogs. Enjoy.\n+ Many more.\n\nIf you haven't used SkySafari 7 Pro before, here's what you can do with it:\n\n+ Hold your device up, and SkySafari 7 Pro will find stars, constellations, planets, and more! The star chart updates automatically with your movements for the ultimate stargazing experience.\n\n+ Simulate the night sky up to 100,000 years in the past or future! Animate meteor showers, conjunctions, eclipses, and other celestial events.\n\n+ Control your telescope, log and plan your observations.\n\n+ Optionally backup all of your observing data in our secure cloud storage and make it easily accessible to multiple devices as well as from our new web interface, LiveSky.com.\n\n+ Augmented Reality (AR) mode\n\n+ Night Vision.\n\n+ Orbit Mode. Leave the Earth’s surface behind, and fly through our solar system.\n\n+ Galaxy View shows the position of deep sky objects in our Milky Way!\n\n+ Much more!"

      "label": "This app is a recreation of the Noah Webster 1828 two-volume dictionary. Its intrinsic value will not only be of great interest to those studying American heritage and Christian studies, but also to writers and those exploring poetry.\n\nNoah Websters 1828 American Dictionary contains the greatest number of Biblical definitions given in any reference volume. It is an invaluable resource written when American values and patriotism were based on Christian values.\n\nOf interest to poets and writers, The Noah Webster dictionary was used extensively by Emily Dickinson. We know that she made frequent and extensive use of Noah Webster's American Dictionary of the English Language in writing her poems, paying attention not only to the definitions but also to Webster's etymologies and his illustrative quotations.\n\nBeing able to see how definitions have evolved today is fascinating, and a great resource when studying.\n\nYou can easily search or browse the entire dictionary and add favourites to revisit later.\n\nApp design by professional app developer NASDA Studios."

      "label": "Strong's Concordance, is a concordance of the King James Bible (KJV) that was constructed under the direction of Dr. James Strong (1822–1894) and first published in 1890.\n\nA concordance lets the reader directly compare how the same word may be used else where in the Bible. In this way the Strong's Concordance provides an independent check against translations, and offers an opportunity for greater, and more technically accurate understanding of the Bible text.\n\nWant to see it in action before you buy? Try Strong's Concordance Lite which provides a 100% functional demo of Matthew and Genesis.\n\nThis program does not require internet access, everything you need is all stored on the iDevice.\n\nFeatures:\n* Search for English words, and lookup Greek/Hebrew dictionaries.\n* Proper concordance, listing how the word was translated in other bible verses.\n* Full King James Text is included\n* Click on any blue word for concordance text.\n* Night mode for those that like to read at night (White on black)\n* iPad support\n\nPlease note: This version is not an \"exhaustive\" concordance, and does skip smaller words such as \"and, or, the, a\" as well as some other words. Though we think you'll find it has most (if not all) the words you'll ever need.\n\nWe're open to suggestions for improvement in future versions. Send comments and suggestions to strongs at orionsys.org."

This is a list of those Posted Anti-Gun businesses. \n\nThis #1-selling app of its kind (both on Apple App Store and other platforms) already includes over 19,000 current anti-gun locations and 17,000 pro-2a alternatives.\n\nFind hotels where you can’t carry before booking a trip to one. Find restaurants where you cannot carry before making dinner plans. Find stores to avoid before you step out the door. It is extremely inconvenient to not find out until you get to a location that they prohibit your second amendment rights. You have to either disarm in the parking lot (causing your vehicle to be a target for thieves) or go somewhere else at the last second. If you know beforehand, you can avoid the places that prohibit carry, or you can leave your firearm at home if you must attend. \n\nWe have a comprehensive list of \"Posted anti-gun\" locations collected in Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin. We have assembled smaller lists in  Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Idaho, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Utah, West Virginia, and Wyoming; provided by many great gun forums and sites with their permission. Since it is crowd-sourced by users like you, please help the list continue to grow!\n\nThe app also includes the option to add pro-gun alternatives that do not prohibit carry.  Search for pro-gun substitutes to the anti-gun businesses.  Easily add new ones to the list every time you experience firearm-friendly (or neutral) service.\n\nThis app includes the easy ability to take action.  Call or email a listed business to let them know your opinion!\n\nLaws regarding signage, and prohibited locations (no sign needed) vary by state. To understand your state’s specific laws, download \"CCW – 50 State Guide\" (http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id443321291). \n\nThis list is user-updated, and will continue to get better over time. But this relies on you! If you go to a place not on the list and they have a sign, please add it with a few clicks via the \"Add a Business\" button! If a place had taken down their sign, get it removed the same way! If you already have a list of anti-gun businesses in your area or state, send us an email. We would love to include any data you have collected, and give you credit for it! \n\nIf you experience any bugs or issues, please email (using the \"Feedback\" button) before leaving app feedback. \n\nDisclaimer: This application implies no warranty regarding the ability to legally carry in any locale or situation and does not constitute legal advice. Every user is responsible for knowing and abiding by the laws in his or her state. Some areas are illegal to carry by statute, even without signage. If unsure, contact local law enforcement or legal counsel. All information provided is simply the opinion of various users who added the location. By downloading and/or purchasing the application, you agree that you assume all risk and are responsible for confirming legality and abiding by all firearm laws. Please see full Disclaimer on Developer Website (below).\n\nThis application was built by Nantz Consulting & Workman Consulting LLC."

      "label": "The Lost Person Behavior App is based upon the Search and Rescue (SAR) international gold standard reference tool on where to look for lost and missing persons. Every Public Safety Official needs to know where the missing person might be, what to ask, where to look, and what to do when minutes matter. The app was built around the field needs of Public Safety Officials.  No matter how remote the location, the app continues to function since no network connection is required, once installed.\n\nThis life-saving information is customized for 41 different subject categories. The categories are organized into a hierarchy of groups including external factors (abductions, aircraft), water incidents (boats and persons in the water), wheeled incidents (ATV, mountain bikes, vehicles, etc.), mental states (autism, dementia, despondent, intellectual disability, mental illness, substance intoxication), children (in five different age groups), and eighteen outdoor activities (hiker, hunter, climber, gatherer, skier, etc.).\n\nThe app guides the user in selecting the correct subject category by several means. The subject category wizard allows the user to select potential scenarios and then will suggest the best match for the subject category.  For example, if a child was riding his bicycle and was then known to be abducted, the user could select Child, Wheel/Motorized, and Abduction; the wizard would suggest using the abduction category. Alternately, the user can go straight to a subject category by using favorites, an alphabetical list, or the hierarchy list. Once the subject category is selected, the Lost Person Behavior App provides the user with: \n•\tbehavioral profiles\n•\ttactical briefings\n•\tspecific investigative questions\n•\tspatial and survival statistics\n•\tsuggestions for initial tasks (reflex tasking).\n\nThe all-new tactical briefings distill the statistics and profiles to the key points that every field searcher must know. The more extensive profile, full statistics, and suggested initial tasks assist even the seasoned search planner. The highly detailed questions for the investigation resulted from decades of SAR experience and thousands of missions.\n\nThe app even allows you to email a checklist of these critical tasks and interview questions so that you may print them out.  The email could also be used for providing remote support or documenting tasks that have been completed.\n\nDetermining where to look is one of the major functions of the search statistics, which are now provided in a graphical and tabular format.  The statistics from thousands of SAR missions allow the search planner to see where similar previous search subjects were found. The SAR statistics include:\n•\tDistance from the Initial Planning Point\n•\tElevation model (likelihood of going up, down, or staying at the same elevation)\n•\tMobility model (how long will the subject keep moving)\n•\tDispersion angle (given a direction of travel, how well does that predict subject’s location)\n•\tTrack Offset model (how far away from a feature such as a road or trail is subject found)\n•\tFind location (at what type of geographic feature was the subject found)\n•\tScenario (what caused the subject to become missing)\n•\tSurvivability overall (what is the overall chance of finding the subject alive or injured)\n•\tSurvivability rate (how does survivability rate change in 24-hour increments).\n\nThe Lost Person Behavior App can be easily customized to only show the statistical information you actually need. The user can customize for ecoregion, terrain, and urban incidents. The user can view the data in both metric and English units. Several additional helpful tools are built into the app. Contextual help is provided on every page with additional information boxes, which explain every element of the app on the page you need.  The information page provides information about the bike wheel model used to describe initial tactical deployment (reflex tasking), a glossary, help, and contact information."

A section for random sign generation for practice, an audio sign Callout Section, and links to the official AKC YouTube videos (internet connection required). It also includes a little memory game, and a mini course designer.\n\nIf you like the app, please take time to give it a positive review. A lot of time and energy is spent in the creation of an application like this, it is always nice to read some encouraging words. \n\nDo you have an idea that you would like to see in the app?

      "label": "SkySafari 6 Pro will revolutionize your astronomical viewing experience.  It has the largest database of any astronomy app, includes every solar system object ever discovered, offers unparalleled accuracy, flawless telescope control, Augmented Reality (AR) mode, and provides the very best experience under the stars when you depend on it. Discover why SkySafari 6 Pro is the #1 recommended astronomy app for serious amateur astronomers since 2009.\n\nHere's what's new in version 6:\n\n1) Complete support for iOS 13 and iPhone 11. We release regular updates.\n\n2) Clouds and Astronomy. Two words that rarely go together. SkySafari 6 Pro will (optionally) back up all of your observing data in our secure cloud storage and make it easily accessible to multiple devices as well as from our new web interface, LiveSky.com.\n\n3) We Have The Best Stars. Precise, modern and deep. We’ve updated our star catalog to use the latest and greatest, UCAC5 star catalog. If 25 million stars down to 15th magnitude isn’t enough for you, an easy in-app purchase gets you down to 16.5 magnitude and a whopping 100 million stars!\n\n4) We Have The Best Galaxies. The PGC catalog includes galaxies down to 18th magnitude. Want more galaxies? How about 2.6 million more? An in-app purchase gives you access to the largest galaxy database available for your device.\n\n5) Observers First. A redesign of our tools puts the active observer first. Quick access to features like your equipment, observing sites, lists, and observations make it easy and enjoyable to get out, observe, and record your observations. The observing sessions feature lets you collect your observations into groups that span a few hours, or a few nights.\n\n6) Graph It. The completely new graph tool will give a quick visual representation of an object’s altitude above the horizon. Essential for planning your night’s observations.\n\n7) Plan It. Make the most of your time under the stars. Our updated planner is a powerful tool that lets you create a list of targets for your observing session with filters like object types, specific time ranges, constellation, catalog, and more. Plan it and get more done.\n\n8) Say It. Ever just wanted to just yell at your device and tell it what to do!? SkySafari 6 adds basic voice control for a wide range of operations. Say “select Jupiter,” “search for Titan,” “center on Polaris” and SkySafari will do the work for you. Yelling optional. \n\n9) Tilt It. Every old astronomy app these days lets your tilt and pan your device to show different parts of the sky, but who else lets you control your telescope that way!? “Tilt to slew” is an optional mode allowing you to keep your eye in the eyepiece, and, using the accelerometers in your device, gently translate the movements of your hands into smooth telescope motion.\n\n10) Share It. SkySafari 6 is more than just a mobile app, it’s a new system to help organize and share your observing experiences. With a free signup, you can see and share your observing data from our web portal, LiveSky.com! Affordable premium memberships add online editing, so you can not only view, but edit your observations, add new observing sites, manage your equipment and more. Finally, (coming soon) you can view, edit and manage your settings files with SkySafari Web, our fully functional web version.\n\nIf you haven't used SkySafari 6 Pro before, here's what you can do with it:\n\n• Hold your device up, and SkySafari 6 Pro will find stars, constellations, planets, and more! The star chart updates automatically with your movements for the ultimate stargazing experience.\n\n• Simulate the night sky up to 10,000 years in the past or future! Animate meteor showers, conjunctions, eclipses, and other celestial events.\n\n• Control your telescope, log and plan your observations.\n\n• Night Vision.\n\n• Orbit Mode. Leave the Earth’s surface behind, and fly through our solar system.\n\n• Galaxy View shows the position of deep sky objects in our Milky Way!\n\n• Much more!"

Enter Bar Essay Rules 2021, an Amazon #1 Best Selling book, with verbatim rule statements ready for use - but now in an app!  These rules have been traced to case law, statute and restatement, and provide the most succinct, easily memorized rule statements available.  Updated in October of 2021, this book provides rules applicable in all 50 states, supplemented where appropriate with the law necessary to pass the United States' most difficult Bar exam - California.  \n\nThe rules are broken down by subject, from Civil Procedure to Wills & Trusts, and are provided in flashcard format.  Randomize to review rules from all subjects, or select individual subject to focus your studies.  Already have Rule 16(b) memorized and don't want to see it any longer?  No problem, press the \"Don't Show Again\" button, and remove it from your study deck.  Change your mind and want a full review?  Simply re-add it to your deck and press onward.\n\nThese rules form the basis of all you need to memorize for the bar exam - you will learn the MBEs by doing the questions, and you will learn to put the PT together by doing PTs, but you'll be required to memorize these rules.

This app is perfect for catechism students who have trouble remembering all of their prayers, or for your own personal daily worship.  With all of the Rosary prayers from the official Vatican website inside, and the easy to use controls, you can view each daily prayer in one of four display styles. Adjust the font size to accommodate your visual preference.\n\nAs you make your way through the daily prayers, inspirational background music (choose either In His Time or Ave Maria) puts you in the right frame of mind for meditation. Each mystery is depicted in living color with beautiful pictures, or, if you prefer, you can add pictures from your personal photo album as well. This gorgeous art work is accompanied by Bible passages to help you reflect more deeply on each event. However, if you have a scripture which is a personal favorite, you can add your own text. \n\nMake your Holy Rosary Deluxe more personal by changing the beads to the color of your choice. Also you are able to choose how to progress through the prayer beads. Touch the current bead, and it will highlight and enlarge for prayer, or tap the arrow to move to the next bead. Each prayer bead is marked with a number so you can easily monitor your progress through the Rosary. \n\nThis app even remembers where you stopped during your last prayer and resumes where you left off when you return. If you accidentally skip ahead, you can easily go back to the proper bead to finish your prayer. When you're praying the new Novena feature, you can turn the Divine Mercy Chaplet on or off. The choice is yours.\n\nHoly Rosary Deluxe is the most versatile prayer app on the market, today. Everything you need is in one convenient place, so you can pray the Rosary where and when you choose.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n- Choose from four different display styles to pray the Holy Rosary and the Chaplet.\n- Each mystery has an image that helps to reflection of his events. Also this images can view in full screen.\n- There is a scripture for each mystery that helps you to meditate about the Jesus christ life.\n- Background music: 'Ave Maria' and 'In His Time'.\n- You can add pictures to the Rosary with your library.\n- You can edit the text for each prayer of the Holy Rosary.\n- You can edit the four themes:\n   - Colors\n   - Buttons\n   - Beads\n   - Crosses\n   - Virgins\n- Remember the mystery and the prayers that have been prayed the last time.\n- The Novena gives you the option to pray with the Chaplet or without it."

More precisely on the sword, the dusack, the rapier, the dagger and the staff (the later contains staff, halberd and pike). This app is dedicated to the first part of Joachim Meyer's work, the sword. \n\n\r\nNavicartum features not only a transcription and translation of the sword part of the fencing treatise including all images, but also a newly composed version of the book as a reference book. It contains among other things conceptual interpretations of all techniques and an improved referencing and description of all images.

Whether they are your children, parents, family, or friends, you can track as many Elders, Sisters, or Couples as you wish and incorporate as many details as you like. This is perfect for parents, families, bishops, and anyone who has friends or family serving missions. Here are some of the features:\n\nMissionaries Page – Shows all of the missionaries you are tracking and where they are serving. Photos can be inserted as a visual reminder. This list can be sorted alphabetically or by the date that they return home. \n\nMissionary Stats – If you tap on a missionary from the list, you can see all of the information about that missionary including their picture, the flag of the state or country where they are serving, days served, days remaining, percent complete, email address, mailing address, current companion(s), and a favorite scripture or quote. The email address is also a direct link to your email, so that you can start an email to them from this view. You can also put in a future departure date and it will countdown the days until they leave.\n\nMissionary Edit Page – Edit the missionary’s information to make updates to picture, area, departure and return dates, email address, and quotes. \n\nTransfers – If you click on the View Transfers button, you see a list of all the transfers that have been entered. From here you can add new transfers or companions or edit existing ones. On the Edit Transfer page, you can enter their current area, companion, date of the transfer, choose a color for the map, enter their mailing address, and add notes about that things that are going on in that area. Information from the most recent transfer is moved onto the Stats page. \n\nView Map – If you click on the View Map button, you will see an outline map of the country or state where that missionary is serving. This map is automatically filled in as the days go by to show their progress in the map. Colors coordinate with the Transfers list – you can changes colors based on areas, companion, by transfer, or whatever you would like. Have fun, be creative. \n\nShare – This button allows you to send the missionary’s email address, mailing address, and other information in a variety of formats (text, PDF, Link) using several sharing methods (message, email, Facebook, etc.). User can choose which information to send and in what format. This is a quick and easy way to send contact information to family or friends who want to write to them and keeps people updated in social media. Copy & Paste functionality is also enabled through the Share button. The PDF format also serves as a permanent record of the missionaries activities when their mission is completed.\n\nSync – The sync feature provides the ability to save a copy of your data to a secure cloud account. From here, you can sync your data across multiple devices and protect against data loss when upgrading devices or in the event of a device failure. To use this feature, just create a Sync Account.\n\nThis is the perfect app for keeping up on your missionaries on a daily basis and it brings all of the relevant information together in a fun and creative way."

      "label": "The IAP Bushings & Tubes app provides a searchable and sortable interface to over 4000 pen kits from most of the major kit suppliers. The app displays detailed tube and bushing specifications and drill bit requirements for every kit in the app database. These kit details can be emailed or printed via Air Print. You can create a favorites list of your most frequently used kits for faster access to those kits rather than searching through the entire app database every time you need to reference those kits. You can also reorder the database by your preferred supplier order.\n\nThe app also includes a drill bit converter for converting between inch fractional, inch decimal, metric and gauge drill sizes. Conversions to inch fractional are made to the nearest 1/64\" and conversions to gauge drill size are made to the nearest gauge drill size (107-1 and A-Z). An error factor is displayed for inexact conversions to inch fractional and gauge drill size.\n\nA 30-digit, 4-function calculator is included in the app. It has several advanced features not found in many simple calculators including a memory cell and the ability to display data in decimal or scientific notation.\n\nPhotos, Instructions and Bushing Drawings are available for most of the kits. When instructions or bushings are available, they may be viewed, mailed or printed.\n\nThe app also contains several lists of useful references: Worldwide Suppliers of pen kits with links to take you directly to their web site; Helpful Penturning videos with links that will take you directly to the video; and Penturning Tutorials with links that will download the tutorial to your device for viewing in the app or to email or print.\n\nThe app will automatically download database updates and the kit reference files from the IAP server."

Includes an audio reference library of 241 songs and calls. *** Top of its class, Bird Watching Magazine rated it 9 out of 10 saying it is remarkably accurate. *** Copied by a few, bettered by none, Bird Song Id is three years ahead of anyone else in this field ! ***\n\nLook at the many good reviews compared to similar apps claiming to achieve bird song recognition!\n\n*** 'Scientific American' writes:\n\n\"It's Shazam for birdsong. Record a bird's warble—the cleaner the recording, the better the luck you'll have—and \nlet the app tell you what species you're hearing!\" ***\n\nDeveloped by automatic recognition experts in collaboration with published biologists.\n\n*** 'The Times Newspaper' said the app \"Does what it says on the tin\" and were amazed that \"this astonishing piece of software costs about the same as a cup of coffee\". ***\n\n\nWatch the film: vimeo.com/isoperla/birdsongid\n\nThe most functional Bird Song app on the market by far. Make your own bird song recordings and keep a bird song diary. \n\nHave you ever heard a bird singing and wondered \"What kind of bird is that?\". Bird Song Id is a great tool to help you learn to quickly and easily identify birds by their songs and calls. It's great fun to use too. With Bird Song Id, identification can be enjoyed by the whole family.\n\nBird Song Id has been created by professional published ecologists. The app does not need an internet connection, all songs and calls are downloaded when the app is purchased, one hundred and eighteen species are included.\n\nWe have included an early version of Automatic Recognition in the app for you to try. We hope this feature will help you identify common bird species. However, it needs a good quality recording to work, and takes a bit of time and patience to get used to. Automatic Recognition takes place on the device, no connection to the internet or mobile network is needed. \n\nHow successful is it? Our aim is to get the correct bird in the top three of those listed. In our testing of over 1,000 samples we found the success rate to be 85%. \n\nRemember this is an early release of this innovative feature, so please be gentle. A demo is available on YouTube.\n\n--------------- HELP ---------------- \nAutomatic Recognition needs a good quality recording of the bird\n------------- \nRemove the case from your iPhone if you use one as this will significantly dampen the microphone\n------------- \nOnly record when it is very quiet, apart from the bird singing of course\n------------- \nBe close to the bird singing, as close as you can be without disturbing it \n------------- \nOnly record when a single bird is singing, or when a single bird is dominant \n------------- \nThe analysis graph should have plenty of blue and green colors with few or no black peaks\n------------- \nBe patient, dont expect miracles, the system works but needs good clear recordings \n------------- \nThe peaks on the graph should reach all the way to the top. Low peaks indicate poor quality and recognition is unlikely\n------------- \nA difference between two birds of less than 10% is not that significant, so listen to the samples from both to help you further\n------------- \nThe microphone is at the bottom of an iPhone, point the bottom of the phone towards the bird \n------------- \nRecord a single bird at a time \n------------- \nRecord for the full 30 seconds\n------------- \nAvoid windy conditions. Air moving over the microphone will mask the bird sounds \n------------- \nPlaying songs to the app from recorded material on the internet, other apps or CDs is unlikely to work as this material is digitally processed and edited (inter phase gaps are often shortened). They sound very different to recording birds for real on an iPhone or iPad in the natural environment.\n-------------"

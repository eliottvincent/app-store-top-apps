Classroom makes it easy for learners and instructors to connect—inside and outside of schools. Classroom saves time and paper, and makes it easy to create classes, distribute assignments, communicate, and stay organized.\n\nClassroom is designed to help teachers create, collect, and grade assignments paperlessly, including time-saving features like the ability to automatically make a copy of a Google Document for each student. It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organized.\n\nStudents can keep track of what’s due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and grades right in Classroom.\n\nWith the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and grade the assignment - at school or on the go. Students and teachers receive notifications when they have new content in Classroom, so they are always up to date.\n\nThere are many benefits of using Classroom:\n\nEasy to set up\nTeachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It takes just minutes to set up.\n\nSaves time\nThe simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review, and grade assignments quickly, all in one place.\n\nImproves organization\nStudents can see all of their assignments on an assignments page, and all class materials (e.g., documents, photos, and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.\n\nEnhances communication\nClassroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.\n\nSecure\nLike the rest of Google Workspace for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes.\n\nPermissions Notice:\nCamera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.\nMicrophone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.\nPhotos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom. Photos or videos posted to Classroom will be stored on Google servers in order to show them in Classroom."

Our apps have zero ads and no flashy features, thus providing a safe and non-intrusive learning experience. We use ABA therapy-inspired positive reinforcement that rewards kids with fun games and stickers for trying. Having the app at your fingertips makes it easy to practice in a routine that suits you, and helps avoid stressful disruptions that can upset your child.\nOur apps use multiple child and platform support, so with one sign-in ALL of your kids can use the app, no matter if it's on your device, a partner’s, or grandparents’. One sign-in also includes our new reading app READING BLUBS – designed with over 200 teachers and literacy experts.\nYou can now get access to language versions in US and UK English, Spanish, French, & (Brazilian) Portuguese. \n\nKEY FEATURES:\nParents’ Academy:\nA newly-added parent section provides access to an ever-growing content library of 350+ articles on parenting, homeschooling, education, speech therapy, and more. All written by 20+ speech and teaching professionals. Also, check out our practical video tips!\n\n\nKids’ area:\nThere are over 1500+ exercises, activities, videos, mini-games, and dozens of NEW face filters. We have lions, firefighters, monkeys, giraffes, hats, glasses, and more. Also, the app’s look and feel is even more child-friendly and engaging. There are some new animal characters to guide and motivate kids through exercises to achieve learning goals and make learning fun!\nChoose from 28 fun sections: Early Sounds, When I Grow Up, Get into Shapes, Living Colors, Yummy Time, This Is My Body, Mouth Gym, Animal Kingdom, Ride Your Wheels, Sing-Along, and many more!\n\nSCIENTIFICALLY-PROVEN LEARNING TECHNIQUES\nSpeech Blubs uses video modeling for immersive learning, where children observe their peers as “teachers'' on video. When children watch their peers in real-time, their MIRROR NEURONS fire up! This scientifically proven and effective approach was confirmed in a UCLA study published by the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association and showed that kids learn faster and better when learning from other kids.\n\nSUBSCRIPTION, PRICING, & TERMS\nSpeech Blubs starts with a 7-day free trial. You get a free personalized report with tips & tricks, plus unlimited access to all the activities to try our app. Your subscription automatically renews unless the auto-renew feature is turned off at least 24 hrs. before the end of the current period.

Now you can learn through song – scientifically proven to be one of the most effective ways to learn how to speak a new language!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\nHow does the Univoice app work?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n**No singing skill required! We grade only on pronunciation**\n• Pick from Spanish, French, German, and English\n• Choose from a wide range of 30+ music genres\n• Sing (or speak) with the artist in the language you’re learning\n• Follow the translation into your native language as you speak\n• Familiarize yourself with idioms & slang words you won’t find in a textbook\n• Expand your vocabulary & learn new phrases the fun way... through music!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\nWhat motivates Univoicers to learn a new language?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n• Becoming a global citizen & raising globally-minded children\n• Connecting with others in a more meaningful, organic way\n• Staying tightly connected to heritage & strengthening family ties\n• Communicating more fluidly with coworkers, clients, patients\n• Learning to speak (and sing) a dream language like a native\n• Immersing oneself in the culture, while learning the language\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\nWhat subscription plans does Univoice offer?\n----------------------------------------------------------\nAll app users will receive 5 minutes / day, free of charge.\n\nOur auto-renewable premium plans feature unlimited song access, across the following term lengths:\n\n• Weekly: $2.99\n• Monthly: $8.99\n• 3 Months: $17.99 \n• 6 Months: $35.99\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nEntertain & educate yourself with Univoice.

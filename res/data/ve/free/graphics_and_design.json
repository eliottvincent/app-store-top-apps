Our technology merges computer vision and augmented reality to speed up the creator learning process, and to make it more entertaining!\n\nHere are some unique features only on Sketchar:\n\n1. AUGMENTED REALITY drawing guidance\nUsing your smartphone camera, you’ll see an AR sketch on a surface in front of you. Then, just take a pencil and follow the virtual lines step-by-step. (This feature is also used by professionals to scale sketches onto larger surfaces like walls.)\n\n2. Turn your art into NFTs\nMake your art into NFTs and quickly fast-forward through all the stages of becoming a popular artist.\n\n3. AI PORTRAITS\nTurn photos into illustrations with just a tap — your smartphone can quickly do what the professional artists do.\n\n4. AR MASKS for Snapchat\nCreate your own AR mask using this exclusive feature, then share directly to Snapchat.\n\n5. Virtual CANVAS with a step-by-step guide\nNo paper on hand to use our AR feature? You can practice with the help of our drawing tool: it gives you the right tool at the right time (pencil, marker, or brush).\n\n6. A plethora of LESSONS\nLearn with one of our many step-by-step tutorials. You can start with a beginner lesson or delve deeper into a specific topic to improve your artistic skills. Learn to draw animals, cartoons, anime, graffiti, and lots of other cool stuff!\n\n7. MINI-GAMES\nTrain your creativity and other useful skills with interactive mini-games.\n\n8. SHARE your work\nShare achievements with friends. Time-lapse videos of each of your creations are automatically saved to your profile.\n\n----\nFOR CORRECT DETECTION, PLEASE FOLLOW THESE TIPS:\n- Find a well-lit environment — AR technology requires sufficient lighting.\n- Use a clipboard or similar device, otherwise, your paper will move as you draw.\n- Don't shake your smartphone.\n----\nIn-app purchases: Sketchar offers three paid auto-renewable subscription options that give you unlimited access to premium content and features.\n1-Week Subscription – $7.99 / Month\n1-Year Subscription with 3-Day Trial – $69.99 / Year\n1-Year Special Offer Subscription – $44.99 / Year\nPrices may vary across countries.
